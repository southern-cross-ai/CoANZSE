    "text": "moving on to the partes item 19 the min wood Eastgate area integrated transport study we have good morning I 'm going to was you know passenger facilities and to be put in the 2018 LTP and also for the staff to develop an integrated transport study so the integrated transport study has been finalized has been finished and this is a high-level document it looks at the strategies identifies issues and provides recommendation it 's very highly weight doesn 't go into the details and doesn 't specify what what details of action has to be undertaken in this area one of them was the pedestrian crossing which on Pakistan it 's not signalized it crosses over four lanes of traffic which is close to 60 K speed limit and also a bus stop which is located just by the pedestrian crossing which mr. Jasper today in the morning talk to us about it and we identified in the report the issues with these two elements and also some other elements like lack of title pavements or insufficiency sake stocking facilities on the road cycling facilities or similar stuff this stuff came up with the solution that because currently there is a project in the area which is intersection safety food intersection this project was looked at yet last year and implementation was done with minor costs so the budget the lump sum of 1.1 million in is still in LTP available for this project the staff recommendation is to reallocate this budget to this project too therefore the recommendation of a staff or bus of upgrade and also the position because it could be go ahead thank you so moving to questions we 've heard a deputation this morning which has raised a number of issues some of which are about current behavior and some of which are about you know concerns as to how the opportunity to resolve some of those issues might not be taken or in fact things could get worse as a result of implementation of further works in this area and presumably any work that is done given that we 've seen what we 've seen this morning would provide an opportunity to address the issues that have been raised in this morning participation as we moved into any decision-making around final outcomes that would allow those things to be to be further raised the context in the move to get into the real projects after me yeah unless in they follow a standard price exactly all right so there 's nothing about accepting the recommendations in the board this morning that would preclude further conversation about the issues raised in the deputation or the issues raised in the deputation been able to be taken into account in any further actions that would result from this you know thank you moving to other questions deal given that number two and the resolution is specifically around that that was mentioned this morning are we able to put into that resolution and make some amendments internet resolution number two to actually just explicitly say that we 're going to discuss and do you think there 's anything I don 't believe we need to because we need to do that anyway and we needed to do that we need to do that we need to do it then what 's what 's the problem with 're asking is it you you provide an endorsement of us we can on improvements for the PT facilities and their safety some of these for peds crossings for pedestrians in that area and use that funding to do that we will have to talk with all affected parties no just the reason that Cayman is with the deputation this morning but we can be confident the engagement will need to occur as part of that work we don 't need to call that out specifically I think I mean I would like to call about specifically given that we 've had a deputation about it let 's deal with that at that time I mean there 's probably no problem in acknowledging work that would naturally happen anyway we just need to be careful that we don 't you know there 's obviously a level of engagement that will need to occur we 're just making Whitney to make sure that whatever wording we do put in here if we do reflects the breadth of engagement rather than just one specific part of it that might then be seen when we come to you we 'll have a look at that wording that 's fine okay great so then I 've got Yanni and then Sarah see Yanni a number of other things that were identified in the safety or that sorry the integrated transport study in terms of things like minimum line works textile pavings painting paintings if we agreed to how are they going to be addressed another point in the single solution is putting you know putting the items for the 2019 budget so you know we have to plan for you know we have to plan for the items that we could achieve by the current budget because what we can do we will not to integrate as much as we can think it as much of it as we can done in the project within the budget that we 've got sorry yeah yeah yeah I think tow is quite misleading because it says to take the balance of funds for the recently completed all runs by Iceland with intersection safety project probably at least Road bus passenger facilities upgrade that was not a with notice around the intersection safety project is is was still in the plan so we actually haven 't done that project yet there 's been no public engagement on that project and you 've got a report that identifies a whole bunch of safety improvements that we could do and yet you 're still saying that we should take that money off and put it into another one I just don 't think that that 's fair in terms of the people that may make submissions through an annual planner and LTP having an expectation that is a project there so I actually think two does need to be amended to accurate what has already happened and I do think we need some clarity over what of the safety things will not be funded if we agree to my understanding is is that all of the safety measures possible have been done it all went back beyond what we 've put protected right tunes and that is that is that has improved there 's no more filter tunes for pedestrians we 've done everything we came by putting protected done in a relatively low-cost way and there is additional funding leaf diver in the project and it has been done so I 'm just trying to understand from a community point of view so they have an expectation that we 'll do a safety project it 's an OLTP it 's an in your plan we say here 's a project that we 're gonna do in year whatever and and when some are gone from that work that 's gonna happen in the future that 's gonna have a plan that comes probably saw a community born into Council with public consultation and engagement we 've already done the work as a traffic signals upgrade and therefore there 's no there 's no more engagement and there 's no more improvements that we 're going to do the report itself was a huge number of recommendations in terms of safety this report yes intersection on the recommendation which relates to the same intersection is a review a further review after five years when they when when we got enough history of the operation of the intersection to find effective at that time in the future sorry we put projects on the LTP a long time in advance we need to do the work and figure out what there we we 're doing assessment of what we think the costs will be and then we do the feasibility we work it out we 've done is as we can do at their intersection and we did it for less than we thought we needed when we see that the LTP years beforehand we are now suggesting that we use the money to provide protected pedestrian crossing along the ride which has been asked for from the community and we do some of the other safety upgrades that are identified in this report and then we see that the program to put the eastern us what 's the public engagement like if we were normally upgrading an intersection for a safety improvement would we have any public engagement depends on what we 're doing so presumably the fact that both the staff recommendation that went to the community board and the community board recommendation that 's in front of Council the staff view is that that project has been completed recently and that the community board by majority accepted that that project had been completed recently so that 's the environment in which we 're working I thought we 're asking questions yeah I mean this is the way that this is presented is in an environment where that work is accepted to have been done if there 's work that needs to be or if there are questions that need to be answered offline about that particular project so that a particular member can be comfortable that that work has been done that 's all well and good but what I 'm seeing is that staff and the community border by majority are accepting that that project is completed recently so let 's move on from there and if there 's a need for an offline conversation to explain more fully how that 's occurred then let 's do that but in the meantime let 's take the position that 's in front of us which is that that work has been completed and there 's a balance of talking about today what the level of engagements needed or required or consultation over taking a project off our long-term plan that we 've already consulted on and approved and putting it in towards another project without any public except that we 've already heard that we 're not taking a project off a project has been completed within a smaller budget than they 're originally allocated through the LTP which then allows for that additional that remaining funding to be reallocated to this project so we 're not agreed that we 're working the context where we 're taking a project off a project has been completed within a lower budget than that was originally anticipated so in terms of intersection improvements and the safety of intersections which I 'm assuming that project was about where has that project gone from on the list so you know how I cannot sit off top of my head here I 'm sorry so do we know that the safety of that intersection is improved I mean it 's a big monitor after we 've done the week to know that and had some project outcomes desired project outcomes attached and presumably in proposing the interventions and and doing work we expected that the project will deliver the project outcomes obviously remains to be seen through monitoring over time whether that 's the case or not and if it 's not then we would need to come back and revisit that but presumably the normal process wouldn 't be that we hold any unexpended funds on budget pending the outcome of monitoring over an extended period we say we 've done this project now we 've got some spare money we can use that on something else that 's useful to this community at this time all right so working in that environment Sarah went through a process where they worked out safety issues were and in most of those could be addressed in a way that didn 't require the physical works that would result in consultation right move so the Community Board recommendation past couple of weeks yep all right so I 'll come to you as the mover at that time and note that you 're going to be you so moving through questions and I 'm keen to focus on the substantive issue rather than questions about how we 've arrived at the environment that we 're working in Dave I 'll come back to you and debate Mike got a question around the amount of funding that 's coming from this project so it 's around 1.1 million dollars from reading through reports that the actual worked to for this it 's actually gonna be around 4.4 million dollars so are we gonna be restricted to a 1.1 million dollar project if this is because obviously we 're gonna have an had because a certain amount of this week is well all of it probably will come under or the safety or patei it will qualify as long as we can substantively builder in the next three years for the targeted enhance fat and so if we can get going on it waking if we can get going or not waking mean put it in the pot for extra we 'll be able to push that money through that and get more done but we will be feast focuses on getting a pedestrian crossing across a mid-block crossing across the road okay so the one point one 's gonna be full of mud it 's not why it won 't type all at the one point one to do a med block crossing okay so then we have to look revised transport program that always come through so this will be also part of the target um for the revised program when we look because we we 're looking to focus on payday is one of the key key categories of focus and the target had enhanced far from NZTA Thank You Phil thank you um there 's reference in the report for the around the public transport review which as we know is going out for taken I think is yet to be decided on I 'm just wondering if you 've got any information already that in fact which will give us a steer as to how we utilize this interchange for the long term or are there going to be changes with the routes that we know there is still a need for the like tech dollars etc so this is a lot of work that can be done that won 't be undone which i think is what you 're asking and by the time we 're getting to that point we will be through the RP TP and we would be working with a keen to make sure we we 're not doing because that needs to be undone thank you so if there was any significant change to passenger services coming through east gate as a result of the planets out of consultation at the moment you 'd have the ability to take that into account within the recommendations that we 're proving today we 're going yeah all right that 's fine thank you okay so no further questions freaking one so I 'm just still confused about is in the long term plan in the years 19 20 so it hasn 't happened so how it 's already been done under another there is safety measures undertaken at the intersection through the traffic safe traffic signals upgrade is we believe well a check that we believe achieves the objectives was it put in the LTP a bit of a crossover bit of a what it was a crossover so had the information you provided to this meeting today you 've been made available in the LTP consideration the recommendation would have been that this project was or this funding was not required in the future year of the LTP because the work had already been done there is a need to do work yeah yeah for buy safety pedestrian safety aimed to improve us pay facilities out there so we we still suggesting to leave the money and the area in user in the area thank you so my understanding is about two hundred and seventy thousand and an FY nineteen and financially you know intern in a financial year twenty days eight hundred thousand because it 's about 1.1 million which is what 's on me thank you so um Sarah now coming to you you would indicated that you 'd like to move this but with some amended wording so have we captured that amended wording already all right including the lumati skate hub in the transport that comments that then it 's made about the the additional funding coming through at the moment currently the habitually isn 't on any sort of transport plan or program that we 've got anywhere and so doing that is a really good idea i 've also got a couple more here that I 've just seen through that might have arrived the one that dress number two just the EndNote in that community consultation will be undertaken on the project no no on the future project that we 're just approving the funding to go towards yeah is what deal was asking so number two they 're just eating that and then to do with the deputation today eating a number four which was requested that staff meet with the chair of ite feasted peach juice that any keen to discuss issues raised in the deputation today and that just formalizes which is causing issues currently yeah fantastic that just reflects the response at the end of the deputation it just formalizes that that 's great alright so that 's good all right so that 's the wording should all of that all right so you 're happy to move there yeah what do we not want the local councillors would be involved here as well yeah I think that would be realistic yeah I think it belongs with the committee I think it belongs with the committee it 's appropriate mr. chair and yeah the chair of the committee and other yep I would actually add in the loop so the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee the local councillor the local ward councillor and other interested councillors Peter Jasper and he came to discuss the issues race that 's fine yep all right so Sarah you 've moved this do we have a seconder for this resolution and thank you debate Jonnie to two as well and at lie on the table until we receive legal advice as to the appropriateness of taking money from one project to another I don 't feel confident confident in the advice that we 're getting today and I actually want to get more advice especially given what we 've got with here word Breen 's coming up where they were told has to go through an annual plan and that 's exactly what too is doing in my opinion but I appreciate that there 's a difference of view but I would like us to get advice given that we 're potentially taking a line item project off that we 've publicly consulted on through the annual plan and the LTP and replacing it with another project so your amendment is to leave this hope so you 're saying an amendment to leave to lying on table presumably means what you wanting is to leave the whole lot lying on the table well just to me but I mean if the other ones but I don 't think the other ones actually even do anything in the short-term anyway because a there 's no funding on budget and betas other meetings that need to happen alright so your amendment then is exactly what point to lie on the table until we can receive legal advice around the level of consultation and engagement required to delete a current project on an LTP and substitute it with another is there advice in that without the need for an amendment to be moved just from listening to the bait the bait it seems to me that the board has already looked at these issues and counsel Johansson has had the opportunity to put these to the board and the board nonetheless has made its recommendation to the council so my feeling is that yes counselor Johansson doesn 't agree with it in terms of the advice given to you by staff with regard to the provision and the LTP if you want further advice on that and through the clarification then by all means let this lie on the table until the next meeting we and staff can come back to you with clarification of some of the issues that have been raised thank you is there a seconder for the amendment so the amendment okay the only you 've all right so I 'll put the motion all those in favor or against no that sounded like it didn 't carry yep okay so now we 'll move on with the motion as it 's been moved and seconded so is there any for many years now we have heard from a Lynwood community the the bus facilities interchange in the city after Papa noe and the residents of this area and those who use it heating back home mainly towards out of Nui Brighton and the Coast deserve better facilities than this we have been asking for a long time the community has been asking for a long time we went through a very extended process with a lot of debate looking at where a the best place for bus hub would be the community board last April and in the counts all decided and based on the community boards recommendation last May that it would be on Buckley 's road however the this work that were supposed to be doing time for the long term plan to put it into a program was not done until very recently and so to put a whole defense now would not be in the best interests of the community we need to get this underway we 've been through all of the other discussions and I know that there are people who disagree but democratic process voting on it and it 's time to get it underway thank you yawning so a few months ago we got a resident survey that showed we 've got one of the highest levels of dissatisfaction from our community and one of the lowest levels of satisfaction within that survey there was a target we had a 50% satisfaction with the ability to participate and contribute to council decision-making and our performance was twenty eight percent twenty eight percent the public level of influence and democratic process our target was 55 and we 're at 33 here 's a very good example about why people feel disconnected to this council there was no public engagement on the apparent safety improvement project it was simply a start work notice delivered to the local community board a few days before the project commenced to say that the traffic signals were going to be upgraded that was despite the fact we had a safety project and the budget for a few years into the future at that time it was requested that we actually engage the community for the safety project so people in this area get no say and the safety improvements that we 're doing in their local community why is that acceptable in a city and in a democracy that we live on in Christchurch I would argue that is not the issue here is the fact that we are robbing a safety intersection improvement that we publicly consulted on to our LTP and to pay for public transport hub where there is still not a clear idea about what that PT hub should look like and how much it 's going to cost I do not support taking money off budget for a line item in a long-term plan without any community engagement there were a huge number of recommendations and the traffic and the integrated corridor study things like directional pavers things like road markings roadworks that create huge hazards and risks in this area and I cannot support taking money off that project where there are clearly identified safety concerns that have been raised through this report which I 've sent around to all of you and putting it into a public transport project that of the bus routes are going in the city but what we know with a cairn is that they 've actually been cutting the bus routes to East Gate the other thing is that where 's our vision for the city we actually should have integrated transport hubs like the 2008 report that Abele did that talked about having an integrated waiting room within the mall or within the Crowley 's straight that goes through the mall so that people get a good level of public passenger service why is it acceptable to do that in record an and some millions of dollars on improving public transport interchanges and wicked and in Northland but not in Lynwood why should Lynwood get the lowest cheapest possible solution that actually doesn 't provide a good level of amenity for people that use the bus I am totally opposed to number 1 and 2 of this resolution I think this is totally against the way in which we should be engaging with our communities you 've heard from people today about the concerns how they lack the trust in us to make good don 't continue that today but against one and two and support three and four thank you taking presentation here I know you know comments from staff that this is a high level transport plan and there are further considerations can be made I also want to make the point that really most of the bus you bus issues that we deal with revolve around the major malls so we do have Northlands we do have Rickett and East Gate the palms Barrington to a certain level all of those malls where we where we seem to have the issues now the bus stops generally all significantly benefit the malls yet there 's no contribution from the malls to transport plan we have issues with the Central City at the moment where we are trying to get the Central City uplifted and we hear continually there 's competition with the malls people are shopping in the malls rather than coming into the city and you could arguably say that these bus stops that are perpetuating patronage of the malls so I think going forward we need some changes in our malls to provide bus stops or alternatively I believe we we need to be purchasing properties to provide off rows off-road bus interchanges around these significantly large malls I here at time and time again you know the volume of buses that are lining up outside these malls is phenomenal and yet we seem to be accommodating bus solutions that are the expenses of expense of all the other businesses although the individual landowners adjacent to these property so I would strongly support a thoughts on this and also indicate that we really need to rethink of how we accommodating our bus services in conjunction with the may movin in Yanni of SIP Yanni sweets especially although at the start there was like a there 's like Mick Jagger performing there 's so many satisfactions but they decide points 1 2 I really hope are supported by everyone at the table in a way because number one is not funded so that 'll help from what we heard in their pre discussion this morning for an item later on and number two is moving funding around so even better for everyone any further debate before I come back to Sarah for the right of reply Sarah firstly his point around the residents dissatisfaction with council decision-making and from what I see what I hear what I read is that the decision with council decision-making is too frequently due to the effect that we don 't make decisions and we constantly put off work nitpicking over every small detail and also who 's concerned that we don 't know what a bus have might look like and that 's the point of this today the whole point of this today is to get this work off the ground so that we can go out to our community and say what would a bus have looked like here it can have been cutting bus routes through this area as patronage is lower than hoped for however put him up putting off upgrading the facilities will only add to this and voting for the resolutions today will mean that we don 't voting against the resolutions today we mean that we don 't hit the funding on budget to engage or consult with I 'll put the motion yeah I 'll do that so I 'll put one and two first all those in favor say aye all right against yep thank you and then I 'll put the paragraphs 3 4 all those in favor say aye against that 's carried thank you so then moving on to the neck _"

    "text": "and now we 'll move on to the the second of them which is for the salad and so-called Sun and UN building attitude Litchfield Street so Jamie I just single that I 'm moving amendment of to allocate or it or if you 'll accept it that I just moved the motion is 600,000 and not to get into the next financial year in Mike 's happy to see from there if obviously someone wants to move the staff recommendation by over me macabre to start bringing me I thought it she 'd like to hear from staff before we make decisions yeah so you would like to move it and would someone like to second the Indian War second dirt and there is an amendment it just moves by Jamie Sikander by Mike hey you so no but he moved it as an amendment it 's six of one half dozen of the other no it 's fine whatever you prefer no it 's it 's not a question of whether I put here when somebody raises a point of order I have to actually address the point a Central City landmark heritage grant of six hundred thousand dollars for the so-called son in un building 92 Litchfield stretched I was moving to a hundred thousand dollars which was just this okay so it 's been moved by Jamie seconded by Mike since which time terminal here 's option two in the ten days Tim has moved an amendment who was portion of the motion this is why it 's easy what I moved I 've moved and seconded by Mike option two which is 600,000 financial years because what you need to do is vote on the resolution I can move I call Jamie trees not for the point of taking an amendment I took call Jamie Foose because he said he had a question no I say that I want to but look I 'm not gonna pick a better with the cheer on this whatever you want to do well I don 't it 's not a question of their as I say if people want to challenge the way I do it it would be so much easier lifting would lift he was a do what he 's told on this is what I try to avoid by having conversations about structure do in process do so a very simple process moves emotion yeah that one 's empty and you can move it I mean that 's a no-no the pits called I secede right at the beginning and I got challenged so I mean no I know so Tim has moved option one I have moved a meme an option to seeking it by my so is everyone now help me with that position Mike right so move by tone seconded by Dion as the as the motion as the staff recommendation and an amendment is moved by Jamie and seconded by Mike which is the amount being amount reduced to six hundred thousand right and so but I 've got other questions so Dion so I just wanted to understand the context of the rest of the funding that we may have for the next few years in the long term plan and what other significant buildings are in the central city there 's still potentially may come up yep well Sammy exactly what what applications are going to come in from from building owners because people are still trying to make up their minds as to what what exactly they 're going to do with it building these these ones as I said before they 're they 've gone through the mill with their insurance company they 're ready to go they 're looking for the support they haven 't got sufficient funds to do the works they need they need those additional grant funds we buy by giving these grants we also get some influence and I was just thinking about the 92 Litchfield a good example of the positive outcome of the of the grant process is we can actually have more influence on determining the projects and the timelines when they started to to prepare their their program of works the last thing they were going to do was remove those containers from from Litchfield Street and we were able to say well hold on that 's not that 's not positive that can you not do that first do the facade works first and they were then reach Agha time frames and do that first and we get the benefit then of the removal of those containers earlier in the process because we can say for them what will give you some substantial funding give us some benefit back so it 's it 's a little bit of I still don 't know are there any other buildings that are in the Central City yet that potentially would be coming to us for our grant fund within the next year or two they 'd have significant more heritage fabric or value than this building I don 't believe there are any there 's one of the building which would have a significant high high status on a par with these with these buildings it 's the design and and that 's the if we if we went with the option one we 'd still hit nine hundred well next year that 's right and and in the following year yes because we don 't know what what the there are no self committed applications for those pre those following years also as we mentioned earlier things the just one follow-up question on it yep the difference between the option to in option one what explicitly does that mean in your opinion for this project well it 's it 's a significant flaw in in the in the funding capacity of of the owner to undertake works this is a this is a major building the buildings are actually about the same in terms of their their scale and their problems they 're two big masonry I 'm just talking about the one on which field and and yes of course you could you could give them a lower level of funding and but they may they may then do something else they may decide to so if we give them a long amount of funding does that does that have any impact on the ability that we have on the covenants or anything like that that we 're going to be putting on not if they if they choose to accept the lower level of funding and and and accept the Covenant that comes with it then then you get that same degree of protection because you okay like I 've got Pauline and Rotom and my my was similar to Dion it 's the last one but I want it clarified so hard to say I wouldn 't I wouldn 't have thought so but I don 't know it just it just makes it harder they 've got to then find that money from somewhere else so and and I know that they 're already they are already looking at funding from the ministry for culture and heritage because that the equipt fund is suitable for this so they 've already looked at lots of other options of funding this is this is a level of funding I think which was was to my mind on a par with previous landmark grants that we 've given foot for this kind of scale of building yes well it it would be it would be it would still be a substantial grant but it wouldn 't be at the same level as the previous landmark grants that we 've we 've allocated I think there 's a there 's a five year limitation but they would need the works that 's what they 're looking they 're looking for that they know how much it 's going to cost them million they need to raise whatever additional funds they they 're not getting from their insurance company so you 'll say yeah and maybe you know if they would if they could get more funding obviously they would prefer to get more funding yep I 'm Andrew thank you so forward a staff recommendation of 900,000 for good reason and the committee obviously put forward that recommendation for good reason as well if I 'm hearing you correctly the response that you gave to Dion and to Pauline even though there were some slight differences in the answer what you 're saying is that to go for the lower amount option two puts the project could put the project at risk yes thank you to some degree and the second question there 's nothing that we would do today if we were to approve the staff and committee recommendation that would preclude funding the future project that may or may not come forward to the level that in the remaining two years worth of funding to do that we 're not putting that future project at risk in any way I don 't think so no if we allocate three hundred thousand from next year to this building that still leaves 1.2 million from next year 's fund and that that could could easily be allocated to a number of buildings that would benefit on a similar scale to this one you believe there would be an effect if we were to go at the lower amount today I mean obviously there are none of applicants to this landmark heritage grant fund who have made successful applications and there have been a number of really good outcomes as a result of the use of this fund do you believe that there might be in a confidence effect if you like from other heritage building owners who might come forward to the fund that if we were to go with the lower amount today you might affect the confidence that future applicants might have in the the real ability of this fund to to assist yeah yeah I they 've all been around that that level of funding and these are these are all significant large-scale projects and we need to we need to be able to provide confidence that they 're getting they 're getting a fair fair deal and they 're getting a reasonable representative outcome from Council as compared to previous applications so I think we do need to we do need to have some degree of consistency that we give to building owners and to provide them with the confidence that that they can proceed with their projects knowing that there will be reasonable funds available from Council to back them because through presumably was a significant application process with confidence that the outcome will be a realistic one for their project yep yep thank you mm-hmm thank you two quick questions cuz I think you 've already answered that there is the future approaching if it comes up is not going to be in danger of knocking funding so there 's two ones it seems they 've done Ritsuko and the first one is the suggestion that the this building is smaller and we 've just approved earlier on so I think that if you could kind of look and answer some of it the second one as I guess just to clarify the how important this 900 is over the 600 and I think there 's some gray area about debt with regards to approving 600 and it 's not getting anything else to them because they can 't reapply for five years so that would be there would be it so the danger of it not hit me so yeah those two questions thank you yeah well the keep the key works that they 've got to do the the the building was upgraded to some level in 2000 and I think 2003 2004 but it wasn 't it wasn 't fully completed the the facade is is the the key area obviously further for the public because of its high public prominent facade and what what we what we 're trying to do in this work is is to secure the necessary seismic upgrade works that will complete what should have been done really with hindsight back in 2004 which connect the front sheer wall which is behind the facade which is why the facade is still there and to put diaphragms at various floor levels to hold that all together so that that 's the work that that is being funded here it 's a seismic upgrade to protect the facade the public face of the building that that work leads into the the second question as yes that 's not funded from from insurance because it 's not damaged its its additional strengthening that 's required to to achieve a higher standard I think they 're trying to get this building to 80 percent of new bill this new bill standard which is a pretty high high target so it 's it 's necessary that what could happen I suppose it if we give them a lower offer is they could they could reduce that strength wall and they could say okay well let 's let 's reduce the work that we 're going to do in order to to save on on the funding that we have to to find so this this this level of funding highest seismic level that they can they can get this building to ideally it would be hundred percent but with a building like this it 's pretty pretty tough to get to that level without without actually undermining the Heritage fabric that you 've got there so they 've got they 've got good engineers they 've got good architects they 're looking at a good balance between seismic upgrade work and retention of heritage fabric and that that 's why I 've recommended that grant it 's it 's a percentage-wise it 's less than the normal grant that we would give if you look at the four and a half million expenditure 900,000 grant that 's that 's less than twenty twenty-five percent so you know it 's it 's a foot for the for the investment that councils making you 're getting an absolutely key building you 're getting the incentive for that building works to actually occur quickly and in an order which gives the maximum benefit to the council in terms of recovery of street scenes and removal of shipping containers and blockages so they yes I do I do believe that the the grant level is right at nine hundred thousand and and I don 't think that there will be I mean we could always do with more funding obviously but I don 't think that this grant will threaten other projects thank you so did you say they 've looking to bring it to 80 percent yeah I think it 's between council so I 'm trying to give it 76% in bidder the the building code states that it has to be a minimum of thirty four four by the council anything under 34 is clusters yeah I 'm staying there I was a thirty four percent but the counter I thought sort of aim for around seven assists we had it we had a policy that 67 there are buildings of sixty seven sixty Simpson and they 're trying to go to a deeper scene yeah and if we were to reduce the funding that potentially just lower that down a little bit but still would be above you okay um I just want to clarify comments you made earlier this still no guarantee that it will actually not go ahead like it still could go ahead Jimmy you know this beauty and the purest Beauty belong to the highly significant heavy beauty in the cpt is there any other similar beauty also is highly significant parrots have its beauty CBD is after the earthquake from earthquake need to be fixed and they need to be improved in a possible way apply for offended for us yeah we that came up just before there was the there was there therapy yeah we heard about there 's probably two or three all the buildings that yeah but that they could you know they could drag on we don 't know where where they are all right so um so is there is there any debate Andrew oh gosh I really wish I hadn 't started on this one thank you no but I 've got a guy you know and it 's just a shame but anyway any intrusion yeah Andrew thank you um we can ask the same question using people makes as many times as we like and that a risk to this project will not proceed if we go with the lower amounts of funding and the answer I heard very clearly and it was just one word was the word yes now I 've got full confidence in the staff in our heritage team and I 've got full confidence that when they work with a building owner and they spend time going through all of the things that they do is come up with a recommendation and that recommendation is nine hundred thousand over the two-year period that that 's on good grounds earnest for very good reason and when a committing sends us a recommendation that confirms that staff recommendation then I 've got every reason to believe that that 's been well debated and when it comes here it 's here on good political grounds as well as good technical grounds so I 'm therefore very inclined to go with the staff and committee recommendation we 've also heard that at the higher level there 's no risk to possible and I stress the word possible future projects again like the last one this opportunity while we 've got it rather than potentially risking the opportunity that people have worked hard to put in front of us the funds were put on budget in the LTP the funds were put on budget for a purpose which was to assist the retention of these landmark heritage buildings we 've got this one in front of us today we should use the funds for the reason put it on budget on the LTP what we 've got here is a building which is not only a landmark which is not only a place maker which is not only a link between the past and the future in an area which has largely been developed with buildings that look to the future rather than the past it 's also a building which again is a detractor to what otherwise is a significantly developed area on their strengths I think we 've got a responsibility as a council to assist a willing building owner who 's gone through a proper process as our staff and our committee have to get a good result for this building so I for the amendments I want this to be fully funded at the 900,000 over what really is an arbitrary boundary between two years of funding okay so I 've got I 've got Jimmy in Mike and Dion yeah you 've got the endpoint so we would do what are we doing we 're doing the amendment and in the debate about that we 're doing first well I have never done that way because it takes forever to have one debate on the amendment and then another debate on the actual debate so it is a very simple choice between speakers but why 600,000 or 900,000 or nothing yep so that the other choice is automating appointed me to the list of speakers well I 'm just gonna go around the table thing cuz thank you thank you mayor yep I would like to echo her into the point of view no because we asked her stop stop reply to us the 600k in a 900k but if we fix and improve lost facility near 1.4 million dollars we wish sickness the 600k they only the 15 percentage but compare loss risk but a nine hundred case of low risk because these the beauty and facility is truly highly significant favour the buildings now so man in the building in the CBD and a city slightly skeptical reader haves it beauty no it 's like a fuse beauty this huge benefit to LA city good iconic a beauty attracted people attracted visitors not so many disputed so I don 't think so you know the you will take the bigger risk how to make the happen is my particular cancer so I still go to the community the recommendation Nikon G K thank you I also will be voting against the amendment oh sorry sorry around the table to the people who wanted to speak sorry but did you want to contribute support injuries approach that this group here tends to re-litigate committee decisions community board decisions and we 've got a very good decision that 's gone through a committee gone through all sorts of things had to come here and relitigated quite frankly sister waste of time it 's a three in support if so I will just celebrated the release out to public for a draft heritage strategy a huge amount of good thing and celebrated the success of the eight the engagement with with community the vision for there is we work together to recognize protect and celebrate our heritage which waives our stories and places together in places together and is vital to the identity and well-being of our communities in the district so this is more this is about more than just bricks and mortar this is about who we are and past in their heritage and we we 've come from so I disappointing that every time these come before us we have this debate so at least just respect and have confidence in this fantastic team if you do an amazing job they are all over this they know where the money needs to be spent and what needs to be spent on each particular issue and so really supportive of watching of your recommendation Jamie thinks is you know this is a simple choice between the 600,000 of the 900,000 you know one thing I don 't subscribe to is you you 've got not as many heritage buildings it potentially coming up in the pipeline that are going to be applying for this that you need to then spend as much money as what you can you know I would I would at least reduce the fee that was not compulsory to spend as much as possible don 't be afraid to challenge spending and pull the reins and when you can and one of the most important aspects of decision making I think is actually consistency so the post office building is a substantially larger project it 's in a significantly more prominent location far bigger job potentially twelve million dollar restoration job we 've heard this we like to host around four million so six hundred thousand dollars uses up all the funding for this this year but the 900,000 option one uses up not only this entire if I interview but also the in starts eating into the next so the same amount of money for the post office building for this one we 've just approved just just doesn 't seem consistent to me for mistake about 600,000 is a substantial amount of ratepayer dollars and will make a substantial difference to them anything over one hundred and fifty thousand dollars means that a covenant will be placed on the building so you know I would just I would just say don 't be afraid to rain the Sun don 't be afraid to challenge you have a twelve million dollar potentially job and the square of which you 're allocating nine hundred thousand dollars and I think it is completely logical to to have some consistency and relativity around this and say that option the option that I 've moved of six hundred thousand dollars which uses up this financial year is an appropriate amount it 's not compulsory to spend as much as what you can thank you I 'm a city councilor and I do not it frustrates me that people sit around here and tell me that I cannot debate things they 've gone through community boards and gone through committees because they 've made a decision on it we have a right of city councilors to actually go against that and that is what I 'll do I respect the staff and the staffs opinion but as my role as a city councilor to actually question staff and form my own opinion based on all the information and the debate and the voice of the staff like Jamie 's said this is actually a substantial grants six hundred thousand dollars is a lot of money as well as nine hundred thousand dollars but we have to look at the budget and we set a budget of 1.5 million dollars and as a city councilor I look at their budget and that 's what I stick to on the last heritage item I granted the nine I said yes to nine hundred thousand dollars but I 'm sticking to a one point five million dollar grant for this year for this fund its are always supporting the amendment yeah oh yeah I actually respect what um councillor Davidson said I think it 's actually fantastic that you 've actually raised it and and it 's good and I do agree that you know consistency is really important but most of it grants that we 've given to be consistent they 're all around 900,000 a 1.9 million so you know consistency is in the eyes of we look for relativity doesn 't mean the same but no need for that I 'm also going to say that funding the these grants fund the heritage aspects of these buildings that aren 't funded or that are required because of the district plan and that generally aren 't funded because of insurance and so we 've heard from both of these buildings what we 're funding is actually elements that aren 't funded by the insurance so relativity doesn 't really play a factor in that if we want to retain these heritage buildings we need to fund them to actually what it requires under the district plan which have rules that we as council implement and I just wanted to actually sort of say here 's is an opportunity cost here as well you know there 's a fantastic opportunity to get these I can 't swear give me his bloomin containers off Litchfield Street yeah and that will actually free up whatever however many dollars into that gets the bus exchange working properly actually can fix that cycle lane that 's on that field straight around there so that actually have safety for cyclists I think this is a great opportunity cost they were actually doing and I 've heard that if we pull it down to 600,000 that there is a potential that it 's not going to be done as fast as we 're going to want it to be done and actually what 's the cost of the opportunity I 'm not doing it now versus in 18 months or two years of a lot doing it all I was at the committee know what we 've done you okay so often you respond to what people say as opposed to just go round and some stuff came up that I thought was quite interesting so you know I support the amendment because I think relativity and should apply here but you know I 'm a different but one thing I would also like to say is that when we 're looking at giving out these heritage grants in keeping some buildings that probably we shouldn 't be supporting a good example is Harley chambers which there was a fantastic proposal to take that down and put a hundred and forty million dollar development on it now if we 're thinking about the rates impact of that I mean I can 't find under forty million dollars building off the top of my head but the Meridian one which is a 50 million dollar buildings paying four hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year in rates so we do need to consider these trade-offs and it 's not just simply giving out grants to every heritage building that applied but also thinking about balancing up the impact for the city because there 's you know it 's something that we do need to do let go and actually go and get some funding for that which might fund other heritage buildings so just wanted to make that point the point Tim thank you and um really good debate and that 's what we do and I totally support Mike 's suggestion with regards to being able to relitigate respected it should also who speak to those who are talking with the difference opinion are talking so they 're not talked over or under well they were interrupted while they 're talking so I would appreciate that as well we 're in a city we are and we are I think a city we anything can happen exactly it 's not move please not move we sit for year in year and year when opportunity comes I think it 's ridiculous so I am totally the support of when opportunity comes if it is not going to endanger and affect other buildings then we should be looking at those opportunities when we have a builder or a developer saying that they actually want to restore a heritage building with a facade and heritage going to 80% over and above what they are required to I think that should be recognized not hindered and not put down or reduced so I think that if they are willing to do this it gives surety to the public coming into our city that in fact as a safe city to visit with of a lot safer than many other cities in this country so for the cost or less than a cost of traffic lights and for a for a budget that should be fluid when opportunity knocks I will be voting against the amendment in supporting the staff recommendation which is extremely well thought through and unbalanced thank you thank you so I 'll put the amendment all those in favor say aye those opposed say no in Midland so on the voices that scary also quick there 's somebody mark all but someone like to call a division yeah what have a division think you know yes so so people do people do need to sort of use their voices appropriately when they 're when they 're voting I will now put the resolution all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much thank you Breen done thank you for a significant amount we doesn 't _"

    "text": "number five okay approval for a central city landmark heritage grant for the former chief post office building 31 Cathedral Square in the second thing you 're sorry Aaron q and is happy to move do I have a seconder for it rookie are there any questions Mike just a couple of questions obviously there 's two applications from this fund which will mean or dip into next year 's budget if we were to stay was in our current allocation of 1.5 million dollars for this year and potentially reduce one or both to do that would any of these projects you think fall over no not sure it 's hard to say we try and make these these incentives designed to be the key thing to remember about the financing is that the projects will will be occurring over the next two years these are these are fairly substantial renovation seismic upgrades repair works placement of roof whatever these these are these are long projects that are going to take two years so they will fall naturally over two years anyway and we 're not we 're not out before time we 're just giving the owners of these buildings the certainty to proceed with the with the major works that are required to these buildings so I place the grants as as close as I can to be a balance between a very positive incentive but obviously staying within that timeframe of of a two-year project time but also considering all the projects that may arise in the in the next year or so which we would also like to fund and do you envision there to be any more projects come along potentially within this financial year seen as we 're going to exhaust it all this year in different it 's hard to say there are always there are always people looking at options on on buildings and whether they sell the building or whether they actually undertake the repairs themselves but these these two are ready to go and they 're in absolutely key locations in the city that will benefit the land around them the land and the spaces around them so it 's it seems the logical thing to support them if long process of fighting with insurance companies over the last five six years they finally resolve those issues so there they 're ready to actually undertake the works and everybody should benefit from that any other questions Jamie thanks Brendon if they are substantial grants but totally agree with you their substantial renovations I 'm just wondering if they or if you could provide a breakdown of the work estimates just a high-level and if you could give us a bit of an idea of what seemeth this grant funding would be of the work that he gonna be undertaken yeah the the post offices has a number of because of those those issues with the insurance company they 've they 've had a number of queue s 's estimate the value of the works and they they varied from fairly high values of twelve million dollars to to undertake the full seismic upgrade and repair of the the chief post office building that didn 't include the replacement of the asbestos roof so we 're looking at potentially you know very percentage-wise quite small grants in terms of the that is ink is includes insurance payments but I suspect the insurance is going to be lower than the value of the the actual works required and as I said it doesn 't include those items which are which are not included as insurance items anyway such as seismic upgrade works and roof replacement because they were existing prior to the earthquakes so percentage-wise that I haven 't got an actual figure but just looking at it you 're looking at if it 's a grant of nine hundred thousand and potential ten ten million dollars that saying of work then you 're looking at a ten percent less than a ten percent grant I just wonder you know if if I might you might also want to speak to the other one into otherwise should some disaster to gain otherwise yeah but um so if you can be there in mind but the other thing to bear in mind is I wonder if obviously when they go through the process of speaking with you and Council and you know filling out these forms they need to provide this sort could think about including their than the just so I don 't die screen every time yeah otherwise yeah we can put that in it 's just sometimes it sometimes they 'll you know I know that it varies a lot yeah but obviously it 's part of your consideration yet so the work will have already been done you will have it so as long as if they could be included they would be helpful in just under if you have any comments on the percentage of contribution for the works on it on the other one too yeah that 's a slightly lower overall all cost I think the value of the works there was about four and a half four point three million something like that so again but the same amount it 's very hard to tell until they actually go in and start under undertaking the investigative works and and getting prices from contractors it 's hard to know exactly what the spend is there 's a there 's a difference between what you what you 'll put forward as a worst case scenario for as to what what they should be paying as opposed to the actual contractor who has to price the job and yeah so but but these the the grants to me there seemed to be about the right level from from previous experience that we 've had with these with these large projects they 're sufficient to act as an incentive they will encourage the works to actually occur within eighteen months because at the moment you 've got a building that 's just sitting there it 's sat there for six seven years we 're trying to incentivize that work to take place to go to thank you yep are you of a mind to do the two papers together yep well to be honest I think you 've a mind to just go for the for the first financial year for the second one I 'm fine with 900,000 grant for number five but number six dipping into the second year is you know for a building that 's substantially smaller and with substantially less work to be undertaken these are extraordinary large amounts of money and I newspaper theme we 'll just deal with the first paper did you want to speak on the phone okay all right okay so is there any discussion on paper 5 which is the former chief post office building Andrew Dionne and then Aaron so the comments that I 'll make a relevant really to to both papers but we 've got an opportunity in front of us today with an owner of this building who is willing to work with us to to save this building it 's a building in a prominent location it 's a building that 's prominent that there 's currently appointing a blot on the landscape because it hasn 't been able to be repaired and for good reason when we put these funds on budget in the LTP and when we had the discussions and the debate that resulted in the phones being these were exactly the kind of projects we were thinking of in fact these probably were the projects that some of us were thinking of given the opportunity in front of us now I would hate to do anything that would take the view that when we looked at the first three years of the LTP we put funds on budget for all those first three years of the LTP to keep these landmark Heritage grants going knowing that there would be opportunities put in front of us to expend those funds and to let an arbitrary division between each of those three years determine a poor outcome in terms of the opportunities this in front of us I think would be a mistake so I think we 're fortunate to have the opportunity we 've got I think we 've got to grab it with both hands that 's why I 'm strongly supporting the staff recommendation which I don 't doubt is well-founded and well researched and is therefore very good reason as regards quantum on this one and I 'll be making similar comments on the next paper okay um so ad on and then if you 're gonna speak then can you please put up your hand earlier I was calling Aaron to close off the debate so I 'll take the Jimmy before you Dion yeah on the post office building that 's actually amazing that we 've actually now got to this point with this building because it 's actually been in limbo for quite some time and there has been threats of actually losing this building for quite some time so I actually think this is a really important decision that we 're making for Cathedral Square and actually for the heart of the city because this building is actually older than the Cathedral it 's actually the oldest building in Cathedral Square and that makes it absolutely significant so I hope everybody supports this building getting this grant funding because this is exactly what this funding is for we do not want to lose this building in our city it will add to the social fabric of Cathedral Square as we start to you know redevelop and actually look for the soul of what 's Christchurch 's heart will be you know I was just looking at reading here it was actually the first government buildings in Christchurch and it was also been the chief post office from 1913 and it was the 's quite incredible when we didn 't even have any plans or anything like that so I think this was a really good one I 'll talk do you want us to debate the second one now or no okay so I 'll just go on this one so hopefully everybody will support this because I think this is actually one of the key buildings in our city and if we can get the building network happening before the convention center opens that will be as wooden for the city yeah Jimmy in the social company the Housing Committee actually these issues in your animals you know supported by the community and also these not only the significant have stability is highly significant but it 's the beauty I said exactly same as casita square know it 's a big impact to our city to the people so like a star questions actually these the beauties equate a benefit to the whole city to the people my church is not only the katika specific for the specific interests a group so I think that 's very important especially this morning appraised you know the price is also one or least need to be urgent to repair an improve so we fully support this way thank you you know it kind of comments of my fellow councillors that an especially Dion 's history lesson there that sermon very salient one and I just was looking at photos the other day of when there was a road the winter right in front of this post office and all the vehicles were parked right up to it right around the square it 's quite and it 's a really odd look you go is there actually the middle of christchurch and it is it was you know it 's a few generations before I ever got to this this is really important that this gets opened and re running in the square it 's a stunning building and in the conversations we have around what 's getting rebuilt in the city behind the Cathedral this is the next most questions I get on any building and the inner city when 's it going to be repaired what 's happening with it so for and I 'm just going to lay one challenge down with it there was a tenant that was in there called Starbucks that hasn 't returned to the inner city of Christchurch since the quakes and even New Zealand second-largest city and not have a Starbucks right in the middle is embarrassing so I 'll say yeah we 've got great coffee from here but it 's it 's it 's a symbol of our city 's success and if Starbucks are too lazy or don 't make themselves enough to move into the inner city sell me a franchise and older but come back and put your business in here in Sally brown coffee because they were an attraction and with danga opening tomorrow and the square this will be the first year and almost forever that someone will beat the the museum for the most visitors to rung in the next year we 'll have more visitors as Michael than what the museum will that 's how successful the squeeze gonna be so come back Starbucks grow some and come back into the middle of our city I started and our sister city of CA all right I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much _"

Marc Girard chairman of Historic Places mr. grant been buried chairman of friends of the Christchurch art gallery to prune up our Wi-Fi and miss pett Unga who was the biographer of the artist W a sudden and it was really their initiative to come to the council in to the committee in 2012 that led to the committee recommending and agreeing to contact the Sarah the earthquake on site with a preference for an artists in residence program so as the former chair of that committee there have been regular occurrences whereby council has repeatedly tried to engage with the previous central government over getting action on this and six years on we 're now in a position to see the reality of that initial recommendation I have to say that I do want to acknowledge the the current minister who I think has also put a huge amount of effort into this but also the previous Minister Niki Wagner actually I know was very sympathetic and actually she was also working with us to to achieve this but really the huge debt of gratitude must go to those those members that I 've identified as well as the new members of this trust I think it 's an absolutely fantastic proposal I think the challenge for us as a city now is to make it as easy as possible and to reduce the bureaucratic barriers they 've existed since the earthquake to enabling this project to succeed so the resolutions in front of us today begin would like the government to consider and I 'm just waiting for those to come up on the screen but really we 're getting one section or two two properties transferred over in terms of sorry it 's it 's just one but there 's other properties around it that having to go through the transitional use process and it just seems to me absolutely silly that we would basically have one property that gets transferred while the others don 't and then have to go through another process I think if we look at reducing and making this as easy as possible for the trust then surely the key thing is to give certainty around those neighbouring properties as soon as possible so that they can go and do what they need to do in regards to fundraising development and have certainty that those properties will be able to be used longer then the transitional use that one 's currently get so as I 've said there 's many lessons to be learnt from the earthquake particularly around how such good sensible ideas just seem to have taken so that have carried the can for so many years to see this happen and I think it 's our job today to enable it so I 'm really happy to move the recommendations from the committee and look forward to the next phase of this project thank you into my microphone on I 'm broken the rulers myself sorry yeah Yanni and Thomas Kendra just but I did want to follow on about this because we 've added in this resolution request the government to transfer ownership of the additional properties to the council with the intention of ownership being transferred to the trust I have to say that when I when I read the documentation for this and for the first time saw the application form transitional use of Crown owned rrz land I just about well I just yeah yeah I use this phrase losing the well to love a lot lately and I have to say that you know it 's not it 's not a form that looks like it 's designed to encourage and enthuse uses of this incredible land resource it just looks like 't know I can 't even think of the right word to describe it but it looks like a barrier it doesn 't look like a sort of an easy entry point a welcome welcome match that says you know we really want the community to engage with us about how we bring this place alive in a transitional way so I fully support the additional resolution which says let 's go on our central government if we can have the land now and we will pass that on to the trust then they can do their job and and what an incredible resource this is going to be to our city and the other reason that I wanted to speak early on was to pay tribute to Yanni Johansson because as a councillor he has remained committed to this cause well before I became the mayor I think it was one of the first things that he approached me at after I became the mayor we 've had sort of dibs on on the bill Sutton house for a long time before I became the mayor and we 've us along the way on the issue it was Nicky Wagner who made that you know that major city would be agreement to the transfer it was the new minister dr. Megan woods who 's enabled the transfer to actually happen today I 'd like to thank staff as well you work so well with the community to make this happen it 's you know you 're gonna have you 're gonna feel really proud when you see that place open and I 'm sure we 're all going to go to that and know that it 's going to be a great asset to the city so thank you just in the wording of the new resolution I have no problem with that but I think there 's a question around whether the ownership remains in council and is utilized by the trust or transferred to the trust I mean I 'm really open to that but that 's not what we 're doing with 22 plus tree so yeah I would just suggest a a bit of caution around that I think the possibility should be left open 's just automatically changing the ownership to the trust it could be perhaps utilization of those properties by the trust but I you know we haven 't really had that conversation this was something that came up at the committee rather than council just received the property yeah should we just give it to the trust and they own it but we haven 't worked that through yes you know I haven 't seen that additional resolution there but I think if that 's more in keeping with item number four then ie a use which supports the trust because that 's essentially what we 're doing at the moment were asking councils to pre allocate these properties on the basis they come to council in the future yeah but we 're gonna ask that they come now well we 'll do it would it be better to change the wording with the intention of with the intention of fulfilling the next reason though you know reservation for stop hurry after request government to transfer ownership of the additional properties to the council because number 3.4 actually makes reference to transfer ownership of the additional properties to the count accounts so as soon as possible yeah as soon as possible yeah and that 's all right with you guys that 'll be fine yep okay cool appalling operational costs will be met by the trust through the lease councils only obligation is basically renewals I weren 't here thank you yep all right now put the motion in all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "hey we 've got the draft council submission on the Canterbury earthquakes tribunal bill and we 've got staff here I am going to suggest in no it 's not that one right okay so what I think somebody wanted to kind of raise the the fact that within the submission we should acknowledge that we funded the the Canterbury Earthquake advocacy service CAS in supporting them with office facilities here yeah so I think it would be worthwhile noting that and I thought the other thing that we should do is also recognize the establishment of the Greater Christ Church claims resolution service which was announced launched this week and up knowledge there because I think that you know you can always do things with better in retrospect but that 's weird a number of years ago okay [Music] I I think this that 's more of a policy matter though isn 't it okay but but I think that what we could do is we could we could say in here that that with the establishment because what I got the impression of the other day is that with the insurance tribunal so it 'll be righted so people will be on a pathway and in ends it 's it sounded very good so I just wonder whether because you know the lessons learned symposium that 's yeah being held it 's not cool debate anymore but at insurance isn 't really part of it because we 're still in it and it still needs more water to go under the bridge before this kind of an overarching review but maybe if in the submission we say it is really important that that this the establishment of the tribunal the establishment of the other service in the previous services that they 're all analyzed after the the claims are resolved for the purposes of developing a far more integrated approach and so it 's kind of yeah [Laughter] okay it is here anything else you wanted to add maybe I don 't want to take too much time but I guess the whole push for this tribe you know and it 's so important we do submit on it you know came out of this council and it for policyholders so that there are things such as phone calls and emails lot being were tuned from private insurance really now we 'll turn the table yeah really important it is TT equipment fever getting under way would you like to move the approval of the submission if I people I get to Indian I 'll second it does anyone else want to speak to it Yani and Indian yeah I just wanted to support the comments that Council Livingston has made I was very supportive in in 2012 when council actually first considered this we heard from a group of residents who were having huge issues with insurance in 2012 and as a result Council passed a resolution seeking two things one was an advocacy service for insurance and also for a tribunal to be established and you know it today is actually a bit of an ironic Dame and that we 've got two issues on the agenda that stem from 2012 that six years laters are now being addressed the second will be the Templar Street property but this is really important and just you know residents who came to council this is Maria thack well this is what she said in 2012 people feel sorry and and and so lost and I think emotionally maybe that will give them the strength to fight a little bit more because people have just about header that was six years ago and we 're only seeing this set up now it is long overdue that is definitely a step forward but a lot of damage has already been done unfortunately and you know to those councils credit we advocated for this for the past six years and it 's great to see the new government embracing it but I do think you know we need to recognize the stress that people have been through because of dealing with their insurance industry for a large part by themselves without the lack of support that has been adequate and I just really want to say you know that my thoughts go to those people who have struggled immensely and the stress recognized the stress that they have been put through but this is definitely something that we should be supportive never but I think there 's a huge lesson to be learned that people need help with insurance after a natural disaster the size of which we faced and I 'm totally supportive of this resolution in terms of the submission and the Tribunal being set up a deal yeah Nico a lot of what johnny has just said as well but as I was on the end thanks to the council for the funding that actually set up the Canterbury insurer and said because whoever signed it up on the board of that were unpaid all of the people that were there were working as volunteers on the board in every single day we would work in that alongside people who needed advocacy to help them navigate their way through in current process because people had no idea really what to do well some people there were so many complexities that are involved in this insurance market and and this was really really important to get across Alliance of people did have that hope the one comment that I wanted to make about this is it feels like this got to the stage in the first place we shouldn 't actually need to have our tribunals set up in the courts of New Zealand to actually deal with insurance it 's it 's a shame that 's got to the stage so I think you know it 's good that we 're actually giving us because we have got to the stage I support what we 've put into this up to this Tribunal and submission and you know I would like to see it sort of expediate before the other services that are now beer so that we actually get people without insurance claims lingering over their properties the one thing that I do want to also say as well is is the on sold this doesn 't settle on assault issues where insurance doesn 't you know I mean sorry where people how this is going to be an issue that 's going to go on and I hope as well I say [Laughter] for anything else thank you thanks for sharing it wasn 't actually what I mean [Laughter] good to hear from you though in 'm going I 'm just going _"

    "text": "so now moving to the class a matter from the boyhood coastal community board coastal boyhood community board the Burwood Tennis Club request for new lease and surrender of current lease does anybody have any questions on this one okay can I have a mover move my David East seconded by and Galloway is there any debate all those in favor say aye against that 's carried yeah she will try that with next one as well okay the draft qe2 Markham master plan and I will open with a couple of comments on this I think we need to be very careful that when we go out consultation we don 't raise community expectations beyond which is possible and where we 've got to find out budget I think it 's important that we make it known that that budget is finite and what we 're consulting on is what do we do within the budget which is available and I also think it needs to be made very clear both through this community this consultation document and any other communications around it but anything beyond the funds which and annual planned decision-making and any project which is beyond the funds that we 've got available at the moment would be aspirational and by no means guaranteed we need to make sure that that 's communicated well in all of our dealings around this project because the last thing we want to do is to raise community expectations beyond that which is likely to be achievable and in that context we 've got phase one and then future phases I would much prefer for us to refer to the work that we 're proposing to do now and work that may be considered in the future noting that it also may not be able to be considered in future and the future may be well into the future I think when we talk about phase 1 phase 2 phase 3 there 's kind of an implication that we just flow from one to the others of the next and this is all kind of one big project and in this case because of the limited funding that 's not the case so having set the tone in that way on this report thank you they following those comments this morning and it 's all been taken on board so the the consultation document clearly clearly sees what 's funded and it 's just so it 's quite clear that the the more detail use one or two yeah so in terms of in terms of the master plan to provide and look at the park is home with providing directional guidance for the future and the master plan details three point four for implementation in through the staging planning this breaks down those items and the proposed items into what 's funded in unfunded the specific funded items have been a real focus on the consultation documentation and these have been highlighted specifically with questions directed around have we identified in terms of have they proposal that 's going to go out to the community are the funded items in line with the community vision these explicit explanation in the consultation around that all items all other items within the plan is unfunded and these no certainty that they 're just knew that unfunded proposed actions will be approved whole so in short to ensure that we 've got that connectivity and integration so in that context if we were to look at removing all references to stage 1 stage 2 stir and throw and shot and so on what would that leave this looking like I mean I notice it sits there in the text 3.4 million rays from the sale of land to Ministry of Education da da da initial development and implementation of stage 1 of the plan if we were to say if you change it to fund it versus unfunded I 'm sorry you could change it to funded versus unfunded yes I think I think that 's what we need to do I think you know anything that talks about stage 1 implies that there will be a stage 1 stage 2 state and so on and so on I think we need to remove all references to those stages because it I mean realizing that this is a plan which is bigger than what we can afford at the moment we mustn 't imply that there will be future stages that may opportunity there especially with the proximity to traverse wetland and some of the community planting parts of that that the kids can grow plants for and go and there 's all sorts of opportunities for their unfunded work that we just can 't guarantee but we 're working with community groups yeah ok in the context of the maps you know we 've got this a3 insert on the back where we 've got color coding and again stage 1 stage 2 stage 3 and so on what would be you suggestion as to how we could express that if we weren 't going to call it stages funded funded stage which weekend the planners orange yeah other other possible future work currently unfunded the only other would be there 's existing sports the word existing and yeah exactly all right so unless there 's any huge pushback from around the table can we proceed in that context moving any reference to stages and talking about future and possible future unfunded work possible future currently unfunded work move to questions Sarah and him the future plans which had been consulted some sort of future work but it 's currently there 's a little bit of funds for patina garden stuff but nothing else is in an LTP anyway there 's nothing in an LTP fir for Fury Park but there is a plan there so that if there was any funds eventually we would kind of know where to steer to yes and that gives us the ability at the next LTP to reintroduce those as items for consideration we had the planning done we have the public feedback the plant staff would put forward yes into a draft or would it come to councillors before it went into a draft in terms of the LTP yeah the packs but proposals for there we internal noise yeah and things like if there was additional PACs funding before sort of parks project it would be more likely to go into the Botanic Gardens special plan then in a local park if you like it really depends on here here you choose to rank it at the time in terms of the criteria there 's a set of criteria that we rank they presented victory or LTP time there 's a sort of funded and unfunded and that 's we come around the community boards and what are your priorities what would you like to provide so it 's all part of that conversation at the time but at least by having a master plan in place you 're not putting up sums of money going they would like to do some work but it is we 've already done work here it 's it 's puts the whole thing in context as to the whole vision for the site what time frame are you looking at but once the consultations finished and something approved what sort of time frame you 're looking at for actually getting that work done so what we 've done in terms of the plan is broken it into year one in year two three four they 're funded for proposals that are identified as funded and the year ones being those projects kept detailed planning it would be still being worked on is the new LTP was being developed and stuff anyone could be work still thank you Tim clarified this got one two three four the 3.4 million which seems logical we 've got the overall plan that she 's going out to but making clear that 's for the three we also make it clear because it 's we 're not going to have any extra money from council until this long-term planning period is over so we 'll be addressing there and putting this up on the next long-term plan because it will give them opportunity playing and give them the opportunity whether to go to lotto or rata or some other organization or give a little to start it 's in maybe specialist or interest groups within it that look at that and want to start raising money and work with council I think there 's just some opportunities here yeah I mean it 's not a negative thing saying there 's no money I know that sounds ridiculous but then those interest groups were passionate about the park etcetera will give them opportunity to perhaps fund outside of counsel but I do think it 's an hour long term plan we polite people that reduce the rates down to two point nine five of in the ten years and we 've got a Keith I believe we have to keep true to that and I think just adding to what you 're saying there Tim it leads to a point where it may be included in the next long-term plan or it may not substantial pieces of this plan themselves towards the partnership planting activities that we 've already that we 're already doing I mean I mean it 's this we 're getting good success right across Christchurch with those programs Thank You Phil thank you I understand that this plan is master paying for the whole pack I get their good concept in terms of so we don 't raise people 's expectations unduly like we could say and I think as in nutrients you said unfunded future work to me that could still if I was reading it could still imply that in fact that would be work that would be done was it just would seem to me that there 's part of the plan which is to some fate we 're referring to a plane and just like we 've known for example with the difficut River the plane has changed at times so that those kind of concepts could be included in the consultation Thank You yawning thank you I just wanted to check several components of the plan so the thing I understand that we 've lost the my soul would be the sports field and yet when I look at the staging diagram the sports fields aren 't actually funded until stage five war oh sorry just five and three so I was just trying to understand obviously the skulls got its own sports field so I 'm just trying to really understand like the thing that used to be here that 's no longer here was the sports fields and the pole the pulls back the skulls doing the Athletics track why wouldn 't we do the sports fields if that 's where the demanders as Palestine currently an allocation summer in winter coats so in terms of the staging plan we have lived there and we had not colored two senior they are currently up to speak so those who are existing and there 's no proposal for the work to be included on those two that seek the remaining sports available which currently exists on qet Park is proposed to be shifted so it runs north-south not east west so that 's included in the funded stage the only sports field that is not proposed to be included within what is funded is multi-sport field which has been priced as an artificial base surface and it has been identified as a future need a but in terms of the space identified in the plane so that we when we come to that and should we require that in the future we have the correct spacing the so and just just help me understand why we can 't use the school fields like you know we 've done and soap beads for example with the hockey and the artificial turf we actually did a partnership and that 's I think works really well if those fields get fully utilized by the school kids I mean that 's a great thing as of the usages versus okay so the process for that is just through the community board talking to the ministry or the other thing that saves me a lot of money being spent on car parking and just whether there 's any thought to shared car parking with the schools I know that 's been one of the concerns that the schools are gonna Park in our public car parks but it is kind of hard to understand the huge demand of car parking during the day versus sort of after hours and weekends in terms of community use so beginners is it just there 's any chance facility with that how we deal with is something that is being discussed two other questions one is um what sort of the condition is that Escott community center on is that Jo for a placement I mean how does it rate with current facilities faced by the community and council we would need to have a conversation with with facilities so I just can 't understand where the needs coming to spend more money on a given that it 's being current outlook of the community center from the community center through so a lot of the costing and around the community center is there providing all the public toilets which the park currently does not have any public toilets open above what 's identify what 's included with entire community space that can be used through from community gathering area out through to the community play space okay and just the final question was during the hearings into the veins well there was a lot of conversation about the fitness trail and access through the school site and when I look at and it may just be the way it 's presented in the staging plan or the master plan but it seems to indicate that there 's no access through the school site and that there 's no access around the school site which is what we wanted in terms of a fitness trail so I just wanted to check whether there was any thought given to yeah their access through the school site and around the school site particularly around to power EV in Travis Road Medical Center they even needed to construct it and I talked to mark known and as part of his Rican support development on qe2 and the nature of the two powers is completely different but what I did find out in relation to those there is a linkage between this the school path or the school site yeah linking into the path that Rican sportif constructed as part of the qe2 so these are clear linkage and therefore the school to access the Rican Sports Center and vice-versa for patrons of the Rican sport to go into the school side of tibbitt sorry I 'll just this whole big chunk of qe2 we had a lot of debate about is there any sort of cycle way going through here or pedestrian pathway through well don 't_''_1169.27 I don 't understand there 's a cycle way but there 's a number of what the Ministry of Education calling public access ways where anybody 's free to walk through them I guess they could cycle through them as well but it could become a health and safety issue so that he said there 's from staff faced with overall master plan and school plan because there may be some subhead issues or some access issues that we do actually want to improve if it 's not being done by the ministry but it 's quite hard to see from these plans how that all all lights and maybe just have a hyperlink to their plan on the consultation from certainly showing the access points the I mean obviously we 're not consulting on the implants all right thank you I 'm keen to move this on I 've got Jimmy and then Dave and then hopefully we can get a move on a secondary with this multi-culture company area.also alibi so or maybe looking in kg visa Claire Phillips she probably had more thinking Dave so you 've got comments for debate that 's fine all right so we 've got a resolution in front of us but noting that there are a couple of sort of changes to language that we 've already talked about that we picked up in the final document so Dave you 're happy to move that and Phil this yawning like I really support having an overall plan for the site of us it 's an important piece of land and you know it 's it 's unfortunate we didn 't have this when with some of the other decisions we made but I think the most important thing going forward is to try and get synergy between the school development and the development of qet in the significance when we considered the land sale we said it was of medium significance and that there was the potential to increase the social cultural offering to the community in this area if the construction of the two schools proceeded and that the possible benefits opportunity to counsel were that from improving the sporting and social offering to the community through the introduction of the new schooling facilities and the joint development of recreational and sporting facilities for the local and wider community and it does in some ways feel that that point is getting lost if we don 't aggressively pursue it with the ministry so I really yeah I think we should go out and engage around this benefits that were sold to the community when we consulted are not being realized and in fact we 're creating a expectation that once again you know we 're picking up the huge cost of the ministry of education who seem to have a pattern of doing that in our city to us as ratepayers so you know let 's try and get a synergy between the joint development and the joint sport and cultural and recreational opportunities in this area rather than just simply expecting us as a city to pay for everything as a consequence of central government decisions but I think it is good to have a plan and get it out for community engagement I think we didn 't we do need to be realistic about just how little money we have just been on the site given how much is already being spent by both central and local government thank you I 'm just drawing attention as well to the fact that we 've got a paragraph two on this recommendation that doesn 't appear in the agenda is just clarifying the process of what 's referenced in the report but it just isn 't it requires a decision of council to to make that happen so I 'm assuming that the mover and the second are happy essentially with that as a process recommendation all right that 's great so when I will put the motion oh don 't be wanting to speak to we had what I would consider to come to QE to pack and we had walk arounds we had guided tours we had all sorts of activities and there was an expectation that we might get a hundred people we got somewhere close to 500 so this exercise has been well canvassed in our community well canvassed in our community board and I think it 's fair to say that I can speak with absolute purity on behalf of our community board that there is no expectation that we will require funding beyond the 3.4 million that is currently a available and our board fully appreciates that any further implementation of the I 'll call the spatial plan will require a long-term planning intervention but I would disagree with some annual plan process to to bring things forward if they prove to be worthy of consideration I don 't think there is an expectation amongst their community they know that there is a certain amount of money to be spent on this project it is I think the probably the third largest I think rope any domain comes in at number two and this would be the third largest part we 're talking 36 hectares here it was originally close to 49 I think both before the school so it is a sizable chunk of land and we in our community I think really need to know that the long term vision and aspirations for how this may end up in the future but I 'm absolutely confident that there is that knowledge and our community that there is a certain amount of money that 's available to to implement a number of the features that have come out of the consultation but beyond that it will need a further process to fund future activity so thank you thank you I 'll put the motion all those in favor

volunteer live we rebuilt is powering ahead now and we 've got the final design brief I think it goes out for children as you can see on your report there 's been a whole heap of community issues events the projects happening in our board area I 'm not going to go through them all but just like to mention that we now have another [Music] starting for the knife festival as well stuff going on all right so thanks very much indeed for the presentation are there any questions on the report or on the matters that have been presented in relation to the Skip and allow the community to filled out it was organized to the inner city East revitalization forum which is and just in terms of the actual practicality of it with somebody provided a skip and people worry about the exists relish that they had in it yeah some anybody could I keep Christchurch beautiful had their clean up nice so there was a whole lot of stuff around the city and good so keep Christchurch beautiful if anybody wants to do those things neither one 's to come take a Dave not so much a question that just comment about the walking first of all I had the opportunity yesterday to take my grandchildren on The Gruffalo hunt and the bare wood plantation there was something like 3000 kids the so I just like to extend my thanks to the staff that were involved with that a huge thank you thank you I just really interested and your good sort program I think this one 's also under the revitalization the the East regard ization project as well it 's coming under there but I think it 's actually in front of board and it 's an initiative to trying because there 's so many people hanging around that area to try and talk to them and try and make sure that there 's good relationships between the people who live in the area and the people who are hanging around is there any opportunity for the role to be support people into pathways I 'm not really sure that but probably day on could probably answer it better because he 's actually our point here from the board one of our point is on to their group gonna make yes there is and and they work very closely with the city mission so they are they with it good thank you any further questions great thank you very much indeed Sally for presenting your report thanks for rushing data thank you so now let 's move on to the party 's coming I 'm sorry yes so we need to move the we need to remove to receive the report so Dion you 're happy to move that a seconder Pauline will second that Oh Sarah sorry I okay all those in favor say aye against that 's carried thank you okay so then _"

    "text": "Oh an accessible city hospital corner Oxford Terrace Rockland Avenue to enter another C committee report in this is a tacher Oh designed and lead project and it 's come to Council to approve the traffic controls for the accessibility boxwood gate project now um I was not able to be present when the AG committee discussed this item and because we hadn 't seen it prior I 'd like to hand over to the deputy chair because he was actually part of the discussions and debate I would like to recognize the deep-sea chair of the AG committee thank you yes obviously this one came to their committee with not a whole lot of background information which was a bit of a shame so it actually took quite a long time to talk through and to come to a conclusion there 's obviously some a lot of concern with this design especially that the conflict that is actually creating between the users of the shared path and the hospital users that we walk in directly through that shared perfect right angles and so therefore one of the recommendations within which I understand is subject to a bit of bit of debate but and also in there was obviously to consult to reduce the speed limit for four cars along there to tear in case I think we need to accept obviously that this area is going to have a extremely large amount of of vulnerable people in it that obviously have to use the hospital so it 's it is concern in this this design and we did spend a lot of time before we came to these these resolutions the the committee was not unanimous there was one that voted against it which I guess shows a little bit to the actual debate that we had look I have to say that when I read that the diagram well attempted to read the diagram I felt enormous challenged because it was largely illegible so and I was a little bit concerned about consulting on a 10k speed limit and I did think about whether that should be 15k because that would then match the the through the the requirement slope and the Botanic Gardens and it seemed to 't know about you but driving it it 10k is enormous leap challenge out I think 15k is that as as the limit well that 's what 's used in other parts of the city where there are similar constraints but but I 'm you know I 'm I 'm open to it I don 't really yeah but up but up what is the speed limit an Oxford Terrace because it should be the same as Dex there 's a similar design Oxford Terrace yeah in front of the terraces in front of the terraces sits Tina 's it but didn 't it get caught up on the 30k madam chair no the The Gazette meant for the Oxford Terrace is clear the Sarah Gazette ten kilometres away okay no ordinates that that 's fine here I mean I was just done so so in the zebra crossing is that is that something that we can insist on yes yeah that 's right yeah it can be changed to 15 if that 's what you 'd like no no no the zebra crossing iPods on I 'm accepting the we can insist on it we have the legal right to do this yep cult and yeah I decided that yeah I 'm a bit of a bit of a loss on this so Aaron then Yanni well if it 'll help you met Emir I 'm happy to move the Committee 's recommendation which includes a zebra crossing just briefly speak to it because particularly because the the map is so difficult for us to read when we have the later meetings we had bigger MEPs but I think it might be good idea to say I think I mean I might be alone on this and you know I 'm reasonably comfortable they were just the couple of questions I found it very difficult I mean I 'm I 'm happy to go with what the committee recommend it so so so Aaron 's moved it and somebody 's going to second it felt right so if there any questions of staff oh this could go on for a while cannot okay Jonnie and then aim I 'm just wondering how much it 's gonna cost because then met by Tucker oh and then it says we 're gonna be covering the maintenance costs so I just wanted to know what 's the total capex and what 's the ongoing objects that we 're going to be faced with the projects and I talked about projects that we don 't have the costing of the capital project and also don 't have the operational cost things to hand but you know you could imagine that would it be similar to any other section of corridor when we take that over to maintain it and it 's no different to any other part that we would take over as part of AAC but we were always expecting to take this over so presumably it 's in the budget we budgeted and we 're not gonna get any surprises okay okay um and then just really concerned on 6.20 note that no feedback was received from st. John 's police or fire services and I recall when we did the hospital land swap that there was a real issue with ambulances having accessed through the hospital site also recall that 'm really concerned to have a significant change to a street that basically doesn 't have any written feedback from those organizations so has anyone actually spoken to them can you tell us what feedback that they 've given and do it can we get some work and running confirming that they 're okay with what 's been proposed through you madam chair yeah we were concerned because the consultation was done by Oh to Cairo and they filled out the consultation section of the report when we read that we were concerned about that too we specifically queried that and that we got that response back that they had been consulted and there was no response from them so it 's odor carries consultation yeah but we 're saying that no response is not good enough yeah yes can we can we just put this up paper I mean how urgent is this because I mean I don 't feel comfortable passing a paper that has no response from our emergency services it will have to access some buildings from this road only one only one this met Amir it goes to any one would be outpatients and accessible it 's only the applications which is accessible from the site and the hospital site is completely independent of this and if there 's a fire there this light dhb come and spoke to us on this yeah and including the heat of the collisions and they did not raise any concerns around those because the ambulance bay moves to the far into the hospital yeah and they have their own on-site fire plants okay no no no no no no no no no we 're not going to wait and then hold up the entire development of the outpatients building which will be ready soon I mean it 's you yeah so so I 'm sure what errand acidic sorry sorry you were next thank you something about a six-month trial sort of a distant Andrea cease particularly around the zipper crossing which we 've decided to put no would it be worth putting something in there in terms a review of so yeah through your ministry that actually is no conflict there is no conflict at the present a drop-off pick up for the outpatients the the crossing the courtesy crossing there is no there once the outpatients building is built there will be movement from the main hospital site down the ramp and across the cycle lane there 's a one meter gap before you step up cycling before you step onto the shared path but until that once the emergency department moves west down past the nurses chapel then that redevelopment of the hospital there is an unknown that may increase the flow across there there will be hospital staff going back and forward and there will be porters bringing people from the main hospital building down the ramp to the outpatients there is not a great flow at the moment quite frankly there is no conflict and quite frightened there there is a buffer before you step on to the path of the hole no we don 't believe there is it there is an issue and if it was an issue it could like for the cost of a couple of thousand dollars a zebra could be put in there at any time and the emergency vehicles I certainly think that count secured is correct and I thank him for his comments but I just wonder if the staff might also comment on the aspect of emergency vehicles and where they might access okay as it was through your manager as it was pointed out before the emergency department moves west the only access the outpatients actually the main access to the outpatients is off the Oxford gap but that 's for the drop-off pickup of their patients the service entrance is of antiguos Street at the back with the loading facilities and more mobility spaces the only access that is in question as the present ex is just before the Antigua bridge that is a exit there is a resource consent and now with council to turn that into two-way and that 's probably to facilitate whatever gets built in the emergency department site but there is there 's there 's no need to go into the gap unless you 're dropping off or picking up at the out patients mental if I could just add of just a chat with go to some fire services and excellent the reason why they didn 't submit was because they were comfortable with it excellent perfect good outcome right we 've got a mover and a seconder so Mike Ben Sarah you 're trying to say that there 's no conflict when obviously when we 've got a path go from our patients to the public hospital is going to create a conflict so if we want to remove that conflict we 're not the easiest solution be to remove that ramp altogether and not actually allow people to walk at right angles across the shared path which will have moving cyclists and pedestrians on it as well through you met and chip see it 's a pedestrian access an existing pretty pedestrian access to the hospital I don 't believe as I my understanding as counsel doesn 't have the right to remove a existing pedestrian access it 's not a driveway it 's not a vehicular access it 's a pedestrian access way it one of the main purposes in an accessible city for the gap was to facilitate the the health precinct to completely the opposite because the design is from the outpatients across to that ramp and that 's going to be the flow there like any produce you could say any pedestrian crossing in this country there is potential for conflict so it 's this conflict but before you saying it wasn 't_''_783.83 I 'm just gonna say it the presence of time there 's no concern that is going to be created I I just want to move in a minute that 's okay yep and it 's for staff to investigate a cycle connection between rickland eV_-RRB-_797.849 and Rolston air via North Hagley Park and behind the Christchurch public hospital and report back to the ite committee sorry for staff to investigate as a local connection between record and EV and Ralston fi North Hagley Park and behind the Christchurch public hospital and report back to the ite committee yeah there 's only a strip of land that we are in there the rest of us hospital and might need be a conversation yeah I think putting in concrete along along the park will raise Harry Parker shoes but but will men of chariots in the park spatial plan that that exact cycle link is in the park spatial plan is that yes it has not dropped down into the management plan yet because it 's the outside the LTP but it 's identified in the spatial plan right so why do we need to have an amendment that asks us to investigate something that 's already in the plan that needs to come on to the LTP it sounds like it 's an LTP process not an additional piece of work for staff good start but just report back to the IT committee about that connection okay that staff provide a report Suns not investigate or will provide a report on the cycle connection because you 're saying it 's an existing cycle connection but it 's an identified future cycle kept short on the identified future cycled connection isn 't there a difference though between reporting back and providing a report once costly and ones relatively simple so hiring and reporting back would be may be preferable to back on what exactly it 's just providing know it costs provide information to on the identified futures of it to the infrastructure so take out in report back ok the staff provide information that staff provide information on the identify future cycle connection between ricotta and Avenue and roles to nerve through Hagley Park to the infrastructure transported Environment Committee yes well we 'll pop that up as number three please well it 's an LTP thing provide information on the identified fugitive through Hagley Park information in funding options so that so that it 's got cool alright so so that that 's now included as part of the whole now did Sierra did you want to speak on the resolution yeah um it she I 'm not going to vote in favor of this today and I didn 't in the ite committee neither of the key stakeholder groups the c8c DHB or the cycling groups were in the favor of the current design they both see that there is too much conflict and while there is now an option to look at an alternate route for some of the cyclists the fact that there doesn 't give me much comfort in the meantime this came to the ite committee without a workshop beforehand and there was some time pressure we were told that there wasn 't even enough time to have a workshop before it came to ite and it hasn 't been a good process neither of the stakeholder groups are happy and I 'll be voting against done anyone else Erin and ask you Braun to support it the the adjustment was made to add the pedestrian crossing I spoke to the two representatives that come from the DHB if that was enough to get them over the line if they were happy with that they said yes because their conflict point was the cyclists going that way and the pedestrians going across them and this way it gave someone a clear right-of-way even if it 's not completely 100% legal by definition I know that these Road rules around someone gives way to someone else when you 're on a shared pathway but as a regular cyclist I 'm not completely aware of those from Salford I know who the mall so but they were happy once they knew that that zebra crossing would be there this and you did allude earlier to outpatients mostly a long way through construction sorry and it is set to be opened the disruptions and traffic around the hospital have been to say the least diabolical at times the sooner this stuff gets finished and all the roadworks move away from the area the completion of one of the best facilities in the country get done and look after the health of our city of the beader but keep in fill I agree with aarón I went into the meeting not particularly liking any part of the design but I have to say that the answers from Steve and other people and the compromises that were made actually persuaded me that it was good and I told also spoke to their health board representatives after the meeting and asked if they were now happy about the safety and they were and I think that I think we must have spent two or two-and-a-half hours on it I think we worked through by way of what a workshop all of the issues and I actually now feel quite good about it yep so look Vicky received most of what I would say at work we did a lot of it was like a workshop at the committee and it was an excellent response from from a traffic engineers we 've allowed for the cycle what they I did the cycle future cycle way which the cyclists wanted for safety clearly there are some vulnerable people in the area and the weak conflicts but I agree with Becky we need to get on in and do our part with us so I urge councillors to support it thank you yeah I just I 'm gonna support at nerim as I say I was a bit confused by the by the diagram at our diagram so I think this is a good good place for us to be and yeah so I 'll put the resolution all those in favor say aye those opposed say no hands up for no templeton Johansson and swags thank you _"

    "text": "probably important this afternoon that we acknowledging that we as a city and no strangers and natural disasters take the opportunity to acknowledge for the destruction and the loss of life and the disruption caused by what really has now been a triple natural hazard event in Sulawesi in Indonesia earthquake tsunami and now volcanic eruption which has caused huge loss of life a huge amount of destruction and of course disruption to a society which is very different than ours as well so I think it 's some appropriate that I 'm making these comments as we as we open the meeting this has reopened the meeting this afternoon and thoughts I think it 's fair to say as a city which has been hit by natural disasters with the people of this other part of the world which have been subject to this triple natural disaster in recent days so we stand in solidarity we 're ready to do what 's required if we are requested to do so as we were advised by our chief executive earlier in the week any response would typically be a national had a conversation with Carlene now and I 'm assured that we stand ready to provide whatever help may be required always recognizing that help that others gave us in our own time of need so I just thought it was right that we we open this afternoon 's session with that acknowledgement and just sort of carry those thoughts as we move into the afternoon session in May to manage your city intonation taking mail to send out regarding all the concert right okay I I can certainly attend to that yep thank you all right so let 's sum move into the business of a afternoon so what we 've left ourselves with is the remaining parties and then the one public exclusion item so what I propose to do is to move through the remaining parties starting with item eight which is the main North Road bus priority now this is a recommendation from the community board we 've got staff for this item as well I could invite some staff to the table that 's alright no problem you managed to grab some time for lunch moment all right so do you want to start just by making some some comments thank you so brief overview this is the post priority scheme for a section of Maine North Road that runs from Howard Road T saw his arms right and it 's about 770 meters long in total and it 's one of our core PT routes from the city to the north suburbs and we have been out to consultation on this and we received community feedback and we 've worked through a number of concerns raised from the community and and which is what 's obviously contained in the report and you can see that from the changes that we 've made post consultation and the section of the scheme that remains was under some discussion is the first section of the scheme from Howard Road Winston knew where the staff recommendation is for a full-time bus lay in that area and to remove that section so that the Blaine begins Winston Avenue and continues from there so it 's probably worth noting at this point that just to give you a bit of London 's is actually one of the most crucial parts of the bus route we actually see a lot more bus benefit in that first early section which includes the section up to Winston Avenue and it 's about 60% of the overall bus benefit so it really is critical to the project and obviously in starting the bus lane at Winston Avenue we experienced significant delays for the buses of about 40 seconds and which is actually quite considerable when you when you look at the whole whole scheme and and we do have if the councillors want to want to have a look at it we do have a couple of animations just to detail and that section as well just to show you what we mean by those delays given that you put them together let 's have a look at those say the first animation that you see on the screen and it 's basically the staff recommendation with the full-time proceed from the general traffic lane road and as you can see go straight into the bus lane and actually make that first section of in the bus lane up towards London 's so this is basically if the bus lane was to start at Winston Ave we have the current situation there 's obviously an awful lot of congestion as people may well know on that section of main North Road and we do see delays backing up to the intersection with Howard Road sometimes from a midday so the bus would sit in the general traffic lane the parking would be retained outside the businesses on the left-hand side of the screen and the average delay for the bus in terms of being able to get from Howard to Winstone before joining the bus alone is around 40 seconds before it can get into a bus which is what I 'm showing that so the difference between those two the first is the staff recommendation the second is the community board recommendation and the time difference is around about 40 seconds well yes eight seconds for the bus to do that journey with a bus lane and forty around forty seconds delay yep request to play the first one again and should we right thank you are there any questions Pauline yep all right so Phil Aaron thank you could you scarify around the the timings so those timings of that you say 42 second delay the only thing that we didn 't see with that road and that was why I kind of mentioned it earlier on we do see that congestion outside of PEEP times I 'm a North Road in that section and some of those on-site observations that we 've had is that you and you see that kind of congestion from midday so in terms of the benefits that are derived from an intersection of bus lane as we were proposing it to be full time you do get those benefits outside of the peak times as well because obviously of us this would be able to just so if the parking goes in is the expected sort of increase in journey time just another 42 seconds yes so the buses are really delayed as it is at the moment anyway because they just sit in the general traffic my name is parking all the way through that it starts from Winston there would be an additional 42 did the board also consider the option of peak peak times on one way like for example in the morning time line you need a wider bus lane so he 's being discussed and we have looked at it roadwork Thea the road corridor worked in all of the lanes that we have to give and doesn 't allow for passing and my last question really is around safety for cyclists so if there 's no bus lane in cars apart B we would the bikes fit so the cyclists would still and I think this was included on your and plans that were added to this report and the cyclist would still ride up the side as in a cycle lane of the parked cars so they would still be made they would still be provided for in that sense they wouldn 't they would just join the bus lane when the bus lane started at Winston Avenue as an on road cycling sorry so it was parking me does it decrease the safety for cyclists from the current and there is currently cycling you wouldn 't change their sexual you 're not changing me if in fact it was a full time bus lane only and the parking was taken out thank you two questions because this is about speeding up the passenger journey isn 't it was any consideration given by a keen to taking half of the blue line traffic off papanov road especially coming from town and sending it fire French history which is the right so the no is a straight answer for that so the blue line obviously has a lot of stops that go Mae North Road and that would wouldn 't change even with the northern arterial Korea and if they would support any blue line services on there it would be expressives is where they would maybe go for have a couple of stops rather than try and stop at different places on the way so that they could make that journey a lot quicker it wouldn 't be the services from a North Road would transfer onto Cranford Street because they 're still serving a lot more stops they minutes given no consideration or was it 's not all about transport its providing the best level of service for those passengers if you were a passenger that lived in car boy wanted to come into the city center then yeah fine and express service would see you oh yeah no and suburb if you were and a person that used the blue line actually needed to get off before and you would need to use the always identify yeah it does there was a change in that new plan that the the new one of the major routes been consulted on so it 's not confirmed yet the one that goes up here Wood Road and the services Bishop Dow and Northwood in Belfast so replacing a couple of other lines won 't go up this part of Maine North Road anymore so it was that given consideration as well obviously we have been enough I think I did talk in the report about the change to services that we 're aware of at the moment that came out of their long-term plan because there have been some reductions take into into account those changes but I think the key point is just that that section of Maine North Road will always be incredibly busy because it links to one of the strategic hubs for the hubs and spokesmodels so the Northlands hub is where people change on to more local services so it 's not just about going from north to city being dropped the numbers on those more local rates won 't make that much difference to the numbers that we 've got in there because they 're a lot less frequent in terms of the core services are the ones that run you know three four times an hour in both directions okay Mike and then Sarah thank you you focused obviously on the but we had the community board is looking to to remove a section of the slain in the report obviously it talks about the section between Halliwell and grasmere which provides Zuni time savings of two to three minutes as well as obviously we 're getting quite up if you look at the whole project overall the one thing that is missing about 26 seconds I mean let me do the journey time savings they 're looking at unimpeded bus journey as well so that kind of traffic without those doors taking it you know but there was stuff it at the tops of their taillight this approach you guys are here do you think do it 'll be an increase in traffic along the North Road I mean general traffic I think there 'll be a benefit to general traffic in the sense that the buses will be removed from that general traffic lane I wouldn 't necessarily say there being is it capacity at the moment there 's you you you know who so we 've no reason to think it would reduce I think that was the kind of key Thank You Sara thank you sir than a couple of things so this particular section that 's the difference between the staff recommendation in the board recommendation what would be I guess the homeward journey for people who 've been to town how important their trips are whether it 's both trips combined that make a difference to people the route you 're on because we could be your trip to work if you were going west to east on June really with people 's bus trips generally speaking I think there to work trip is the crucial one like you 're not quite see time constraint of the day so we haven 't asked that question of the community to get into it also getting home after work and if your journey is impeded by the fact that you can 't get the a because the Jewess service isn 't reliable enough for you then you 'd probably take your car because after work you know you want to get back to families as well because you 've got other one of the side benefits of this project is obviously trying to make public transport more attractive people to get on it and use it as a choice and kind of going forward so people can kind of get out of their cars from a transport sleigh she can home needs to be the to work juniors be around people you 're making a trade eruption just wondering that particular section doesn 't have much no have op street packing where 's the other ones do the just before that is actually quite a bit of Road corridor what then I was wondering when I was looking at the UM the sort of quick flyovers here whether there was potential to get you know like you had when you 're coming over sort of Colombo Street the over bridge for the railway track there and the buses get to go first into the into the general traffic lane and there 's a separate space here and whether there 's potential because I see that the buses on poppin or erode join the general traffic yeah quite away before the intersection yeah and with this space to actually change something about the top of poppin or erode which the layers of buses to get into main North Road ahead of the general traffic and get some savings theaters to make up for that so there 's a couple of issues with that section side of the intersection so I 'm obviously slightly outside the project but um in terms proceed from that left turn lane the left turn and into hair which runs at the same time as the other movements in tailored so we wouldn 't be able to give it the jump because it wouldn 't it have to run at the same time or just ahead of general traffic and obviously the movements coming in and I 've hair where the conflict with that and so if they basically if they all run separately so that you could get that jump and then the general traffic went and then hair would when at different times the delay on main North Road for general traffic would actually get worse and it would actually make the situation for drivers worse as well and so in terms of how about intersections work at the moment it 's actually working it as efficiently as it can do because you 've got the left turn into Howard and the turns out of Howard over and in at the same time so you actually getting quite a few movements at once so you 'd be adding in another would it but what that like I would it would increase the efficiency for the PT at all to be honest I think it 'd be struggle to one spice to keep them me the big build-out_,_1153.35 and stuff in it you need to separate your bus waiting point for Angel if two line and and I think probably the and as we 've shown this on the on the plans as well the bus lane actually comes to an end a bit earlier just past Bellevue Avenue so it 's already in the general traffic lane so it would have to go back into the left turn lane and then get a jump after the left turn as it might just be a bit it 's not a straight three but if it was a straight through bus lane thank you I 've got Davey on e and deal Dave can you just confirm how far back towards Tim the bus lane recommendation for this project is from Howard Road the staff recommendation for this project is the bus lane starts from Howard Road these intimate and bus lines all the way up to get back internal traffic yes yes okay so we win the that section from here would road up to you know forty seconds was the median so what 's the best and worst I 'd have to go and get that information from the surveys I don 't have that you mean like the best-case situation when there 's no traffic in that section of road has real traffic issues for a lot of heart you know a long part of the day that was why I 'd mentioned about the Q 's back to her word sometimes time from 12 noon they can be very very busy in that section so that was why we proposed about the Gosling 's dying from in he 's often conduced congestion on that section of road on the weekends as well I don 't know I 'd have to find that out and come back to now it was a it was a model so we 'll be done any actual survey how long it takes okay sorry it is when you start calculating the benefit on a per person basis what we 're getting up there in the peak and you average 20 15 or 20 people you 're getting up around a lot of those buses are not going to be shifted off on other routes this route is still a core route and as the key route so they 're like the cool routes are heating north are always going through the air and all the sure as the other key rate that links through that piece of corridor so just to summarize model one staff recommendation eight seconds model to the community board recommendation forty seconds difference 32 seconds average so the average difference is 32 is that right so the average time taken in model 2 is 1440 minus 8 equals 32 yep that 's why I 'm just trying to pare it down yep all right that 's great thank you Dave was that everything that you had yep okay Dion Jonnie Jonnie Dion and then back to my comeback to fail so yawning just want to go to the financial implications page the scheme cost estimate for the project that 's 1.8 million and I 'm just not quite sure how we re allocating budget from another project or what the implications are of doing that so can you just help me understand that and so four hundred and ten thousand is coming from the orbiter project so we meet the objectives through this project of the orbiter project as well and that was a decision made by alt that they wanted and they wanted the money to remain in that project and that it would be spent out of that because we meet those objectives and and then through the transfer to the transport planning team project two two seven four which is the core PT route and facilities this project also meets those objectives as well some of those objectives as well and we have yet to put that through as a change request because that projects only just been initiated so just understand so there 's three projects in total yep they 've all got schemes that have been designed what only ones got which is this it meets the objectives of the orbiter project as well as as well as objectives to iterate and she 'll to reach runs along this section we 've got three projects that are duplicating what each other 's trying to do we 've got three truck three projects editor honor that autonomy and trying to improve benefits on particular routes no this one is in the Northern Line in peperoni Belfast heating rooms as well so these three there was three different projects seat up yeah all making any actually they get multiple benefit out of this one going a huge okay but I was just trying to understand from just a geographic point of view is there another stretch of road that we 're doing another bus priority holding there might be something say out of the core PT route North Korea in Belfast so see this this section of road is only in pop new way and where there will be extra extra work so huge it hasn 't been we haven 't committed I can 't escape yet but we must have a budget on for that what 's the budget on for that one sorry this is part of the project as well we 've also had other orbiter projects that have been put on hold because of lack of funding so how are we gonna resolve other projects I don 't know which orbiter project entails road until Road from my understanding is it wasn 't put on hold because of lack of funding that 's community because it cost yeah I 'll check it out after this but I don 't believe this for the it 's for the benefits reason right just wanted to check on so we were we gonna do I thought that plan at some stage was to do an interchange in conjunction with nothing more so there would be a nice passenger waiting lounge is that still happening is that kind of stopped is that is that sort of got budget or is that was that out so that was a plan that was quite a while ago Northlands have changed their plans for their site since those early discussions happened and we 've worked with Northlands through installing the pedestrian crossing further up a new road already on mammoth road and as or in the session within Northlands isn 't is it within that plant anymore and there was an any project for that there 's certainly not budget in this project to buy land from Northlands or to detour the routes into the Northlands carpark so he 's got the super stock there as well once we agree to this then that there 's no there 's no connection to Northlands more anymore it 's just that projects gone that was never a project on its own as I understand it and it was at the transport planning stage where those so now we 're having the conversations but is with any dealings with private property we hadn 't have agreement we can only influence in change is influence and change or in the public realm and in the road space we have to have agreement if we 're going to do something and it isn 't it hasn 't come about and they 've got redevelopment plans that are well they were well underway the hugely underway yeah I mean it 's a bit like the point David made before molds redeveloping and public transport a real concern the issue the issue that we have a staff and we have to bring to you is that we have to have an agreement to do it joint agreement to do it so it 's fine to say it it would be nice to and great but we can 't if we don 't know that from your point of view it 's a district planning issue that we need to address because we try to do that through the the district plan and I thought we actually asked for an integrated transport assessment requiring foot especially malls when they redeveloped but I just wanted to check whether there was gonna be any change to the rope based on what was happening but it sounds like that won 't happen and just the final question I just wanted to check in terms of oh sorry two questions one quick question we don 't seem to have a copy of the submissions so it 's a bit awkward we 've had one submission today in front of Council I have no there 's of names or there 's just lots of lines I they each individual so much another that there was the summary table that was attached and then the full submissions went to the board yeah I just want to check out the folks the missionary men available to counsel given that we 've had one submission deputation today yeah we can we can definitely do that I won 't have the and this the final question the overall Road we 've talked about the four to twelve minutes is that looking from basically the interchange in town all the way up to with where 's the time so it was given to us from a can and it was basically the four to twelve minutes is the variance that they have in journey times in delay basically in this section of road caused by this notion of road they only have lighting days your boarding data they only have one way in I think so and they can 't tell where people would necessarily get off all the time but it was their data that said that that 's the minute delay which obviously if you were a bus passenger because maybe handle but 12 minutes would make sense I 'm just trying to understand the length of road it 's the section from here and ride turn to SOI Sam 's right do we know what it is on the total bus right the reason I asked is prior to this when we put the bus priority in lane and Dan peponi wrote originally we were expecting all sorts of benefits and I think the research came out they actually those time savings had not actually happened so I 'm just trying to understand how we 've looked at what we thinks going to happen versus what actually happens given that we do have good data for this route thank you so you only that 's everything from you yeah great thank you Dion and then back to Mike and then fell the assumptions on the traffic counts for this which happens I mean he 's been observed from a day onwards it times end quite consistently over the weekend is it going to change with the it 's that section of right now other parts of the main North corridor will see a reduction in traffic but not this section because it 's well the circuit generator for its own and its own right I can 't find it I was just trying to find through the resource consent again from the from the actual Northern Corridor and I 've been scrolling through haven 't found it but one of the assumptions that I remember really was that it actually was going to reduce the traffic between here would we 've actually worked together with the other project team that are looking the modeling information that we that they 've shared with us is that yes there will be a reduction on other sections but not in this section was around and what assumptions were made in that and the resource consent for the Northern Corridor we 're talking about the section and we 've done some modeling with the downstream team that is showing we 're not anticipating because a lot of the reefs in the main corridor we 'll see reduction so we 've done the we 're seeing today and those mock-ups that we saw that work is what 's appropriate for the decision that we 're making the resource consent considerations may be whatever they were or weren 't or whatever but that 's not what you would recommend that we base any decision-making on today you 've shown us what we need to inform any decisions that we make today Thank You Dion that was everything from you thank you so Mike and they make a film some clarification around the Ginny time savings obviously focusing on and if you look at four point three one we 're talking about two to three minutes between about eighty four seconds between and you 've just mentioned the twenty six seconds between Langdon 's and obviously pursuits so if my math is correct and it usually is the junior time savings from this whole project if we took the staffs recommendation would be three minutes fifty to four minutes just to clarify your first comment you wanted to indicate oh great so I 'll note that for when we get to that point and I all right and Phil coming back to you for a question can I just ask you about alternatives around where the parking is lived down so in that section between off street parking on Winston Avenue and we actually parking serve it and start the project we also did another one kind of more recently to understand how those parking spaces were being used they 're not being used properly so we 're doing something with our operations team to make sure that they 're being utilized better because people are staying longer than they should do and there 's also wrestle Street at the back those businesses although they choose to use their parking slightly differently do have off street parking but they choose some of them choose to use it for staff and we did we have proposed as part of the scheme to put in a new pp5 parking space and at the start of Winston Ave and then through your consultation with the board an additional parking space on Winston Avenue as well so we chose plans for that so there are some spaces available and the same heading towards town is part time that does have parking spaces within it that operate outside of the bus lane times and we 're not making any changes to to the ones outside of rosen off street parking what was better organized in and a bit of planning around her and in cyanogen all there would the not would the not be and the case for actually not needing the parks on the street yes staffing say that 's why the recommendation is as it is really thank you yeah I mean I think it 's worth bearing in mind staff are obviously going to speak in favor of their own recommendation the community board clearly changed the staff recommendation which originally was to remove all of that parking anyway so essentially what you 're saying there is that you support your original recommendation yeah okay one follow-up question yes as well as a staff thank you so we 're done with questions so this has been moved on Mike seconded by Pauline is there any debate on this long time in the making I think we started bring in new transport projects that are obviously not used by the majority of people but still extremely important for the city I 'd like to acknowledge the Papa Nui and its Community Board and the recommendations that have given council today and also like to acknowledge everyone has taken part and consultation residents business owners shop owners bus owners has actually been a excellent consultation I believe and I 've moved the community board recommendation today as I believe it is the right balance between achieving good outcomes for public transport and bus users while still respecting the community that the buses go through main North Road is a very busy major Tory Road and any thought that this project would cut papa knew it in half is ridiculous there 'll be no extra cars no extra buses no extra bikes the corridors not going to be widened if anything Papa knew he has been cut in half for a long time by this road and the amount of cars that actually go down it this project if it was approved as recommended by the staff would create journey four minutes 50 seconds the latest information on base bus patronage from the northbound section of the road is over 2300 people a day during the week with the majority being Christchurch City residents so there 's some significant journey time savings there 's going to be head for a lot of people the board recommendation only reduces those savings by 40 seconds the consultation has attracted a number of submissions with over half coming from Papua new residential addresses of the papua new submissions 71% it is supported or supported with concerns this project it was clear for the consultation that there were two main issues the grasmere intersection and the removal of car parks between here Wood Road and Winston air for a 24-hour bus lane the project team responded to the concerns of the local residents around Brad Smith Street intersection to ensure full any movements were maintained the board accepted these changes and has recommended that they be approved by us unfortunately due to the width of the corridor the project team were unable to adequately address the concerns of submitters at the beginning of May community board therefore recommended that the bus lane staff to Winston EV instead of here would write this would retain nine car parks along North Road the community board had recommended the removal of seven car parks for this bus lane the community board was also unanimous in approving a double bus stop along the southbound lane which will result in the six and six car pipes being removed these 13 car parks are the only car parks to remove to be removed on both sides of main north road between here Wood Road and grass miss street looking at the northbound lane it is clear for those that know this area of main off road that there is a significant number of off street car parking passed Winston air for the businesses unlike the area between here Wood Road and Winston Ave it is the role of the community board to advocate for its community and there 's a city counselor and the counselor for the Papa no award I totally support the board 's recommendation I believe it is important that we encourage the uptake of both active growth that this city is going to occur it is to ensure we have a fictive transport network and this is achieved partly by building the right infrastructure to encourage uptake unless you 're prepared to invest correctly you are never going to get the best outcome when you reach your foot this infrastructure infrastructure into the existing built environment public transport has been underfunded for decades and I believe this is another example of this under investment bringing public transport through key routes past key locations is hugely important but if we have to take into account bit and pit but we have to take into account the impact on the existing community if we 're going to set budgets that prevent touch in the kerbin channel all property purchase we will never get top outcomes for both both the bus user and the community if this project had been for a peak time only bus life for the northbound lane then I would have supported the whole length but because of one meter it was not possible and if we take Papa Nui road am a North Road over the place every time impacting the attractiveness of using a bus this council needs to decide how much it wants public transport to succeed and fund it accordingly at the moment if you look at the long term plan you would think it 's not a priority and this needs to be another conversation especially giving us significant funding from NZTA once again I 'll actually to support this motion a motion that works both for the community and bus users thank you so [Music] Solly who else was wanting to speak to this so I 've got our parents are you an ex Aaron and then Phil was well put together and if you are voting for one of these options as afternoon I 'd encourage my fellow councillors to vote for the community boards recommendation I 've put quite a bit of work into this I myself wouldn 't be voting for either option currently we have around four percent of the population using buses these the other bus lanes on poppin or erode winnin around ten years ago and we were promised a big increase in eventuated and so I don 't like to put the pressure on these local businesses by removing the car parks and the accessibility of the area without being able to take more proof to them that they 're going to be better off I think they 'll be worse off I use this area quite a bit myself I said I had a meeting there last week not at peak time it was in the morning couldn 't find a car park and to take out even more so it just means I won 't go to meetings they 're so black and white cafe we 'll just have them lose the patronage because can 't park is the number of off street car parks they are well Matt it sees you cannot use them so they are not there for the use of the general punter trying to go and use those businesses on the main road and to be honest some of the best eateries in the entire city are in that pepper no a block if you have any need get out try it at some there new area um the the biggest did great for me to swallow is the 1.8 million for the project and then I have to go back to the people just just over the border and say that we can 't do our traffic lights but we can take away a whole lot of car parks for a bus priority lane for four percent of the population they just won 't understand and so good luck selling that and the fact that also in the you can find an extra 800,000 unbudgeted just by moving around some bits from here to there it really chokes me up when we have to wait however many years it 's going to be to do the traffic lights and our wood it 's just that it 's a hard sell to our people and the businesses in papua new e all of the ones i 've spoke do don 't want this none of them and in the ten years I 've never had one person ever write to me and say give me a bus lane down our road or on my bus You Phil and then I 've got Jamie and Pauline film I think as a council we do have policies around active transport and public transport we 're aware of an huge condition and but also particularly on this road and particularly at this corner so you know I concerns me that in fact the organization of the off street parking hasn 't really been looked at more thoroughly in and in fact it 's the same now nine for the pack nine through the parks which you will impede the buses and ends and particularly cyclists and it 's not just one bus for forty seconds it 's twenty we were here in the report there 's twenty one buses each hour they 're going to be sitting in this queue and in a particularly though we 've got the measurement of nineteen cyclists each year in the report describing those cyclists it is in a very vulnerable position and staff advise a day then in fact yep what the parking lea cyclists are going to be less safe well I can 't support this around using the principles council should ask to have a harder look at the organization of the off street parking that 's all that 's already there so I would have thought that at this stage in terms of air transport planning we were very much supportive of having the buses going through roads like this as efficiently and reliable as possible reliably as possible that 's the only way that more people will go on the buses and and that way we 'll also be reducing congestion to and reducing the pollution that I referred to so I make sure he cannot support these today and I think it needs some more work on it and I 'm sorry I have to say that to the board but to me the safety is paramount Thank You Jamie good decision-making is always going to come from from finding their balance and their decision-making is going to come from making decisions and silos when you just fixated on one a speed so we 're all familiar with the term when the bus goes first and you know and I think that is true however we a large amount in fact that doesn 't matter what you do you 're never going to actually use the bus and I think we actually need to face up to that it doesn 't matter how many free bus days you got they don 't care doesn 't matter of every street in the city hit bus lanes down the length of them they 're still going to take the private motor vehicle however I would argue that actually an efficient public transport system actually benefits these people too because it will make the community a private vehicle fast if more people are on public transport on the flip side and that 's looking at it from incentivizing public transport and I agree with it but then as we all should do we need to be cognizant of the business side that council isn 't here to put good businesses on the street there is an impact on businesses I think we 've dealt with it a lot you know in the and my ward with with bus lines and anecdotally I 've heard from retailers they tend to year after the bus lanes have installed and what they were prior to their installation so I think we need to be cognizant of that and I really want to commend the community board here for for working closely with this community bus advocates and the local businesses to find what I think is a really sensible pragmatic realistic workable decision you 've got parking of course you have parking at northland small private parking the retailers are paying for it through their rent you 've got some parking around Briscoe 's I think it 's a nonsense to suggest that people further down they 're gonna park there because there 's actually private property and I don 't think they 'll be too happy when Bristow 's via the arena tour retailers and the mall they 're having people that actually aren 't even shopping and they 're in their shops parking in their parks that they 're actually paying for there is a small amount of parking obviously between here Wood Road and Winston Ave and that 's actually the lifeblood for these businesses that are there because bottle store people don 't spin half an hour and they go and buy buy the wine and then leaving it 's the sort of thing that you do on your way way home from work or on your way out for dinner so I am accepting of the fact that these parks are critical so I come back to local government I guess being about compromise in the good compromise that I think was reached by the Community Board here I think that there is plenty of priority given to to the bus down this key wrote with the Superstock further up the road and this will make the journey far more efficient and this is a positive step forward for public transport advocates in public transport users but I also think that we could be quite proud of it pragmatic solution to for the local businesses around there that do actually find this parking out front of the shops very important to their trade so well done to the to the local community board I think it 's a really good compromise goodness because I think and so 're going to one of them particularly needed the actual so as a result of this the board basically created to support the community recommendation to encourage customers to get used to using iz5 parks and then maybe in the future we can come here can we increase the section but it 's about it doesn 't like about finding the balance but it 's also about not doing too much too quickly for people so the rest of the route is going through to find the bus priority it will actually have a real benefit in improving the bus journey timetable in a positive way so I think just to address in the meantime to the status quo the off street parking behind these businesses is quite dodgy it 's not very much there really and a lot of them come and go regularly the staff that 's why they can 't park a long way away so I really counseling people to kiss reconsider your view because this the fact that they don 't speak dragon is very limited where is the rest of the bus these ones quick things I mean this is something that the reports very clear it 's been a really thorough process and I 'm really pleased we 've kind of got to this stage on it because PT is essential for the future of any any city and we do need to do PT really well and it it 's really difficult to retrofit PT infrastructure any infrastructure that benefits the city into a city that 's very used to there 's very care dependent if you like I 'd like to just quickly address Aaron 's point about no one calling for a bus money he may not have had anyone approached him asking for a bus lane initially I haven 't either but I don 't know where you were during weekends LTP but there was an outcry across the city with people asking for better PT services and part of better PT services is the infrastructure that goes with us and that 's our responsibility and while it was there LTP we also heard those calls and we need to make sure that while we ve can for for also do our in to put it put the infrastructure and I think this is a good balance between the hot in the whole length of the corridor to just see this small section retained packing and not be a bus lane I do share some of counsel clear waters concerns and would maybe I mean I 'm assuming these things get reviewed after sort of 12 months after implementation and that if there aren 't any concerns that that would come back to the board initially and it also gives me comfort that not only did the two local councils support this but those two local councillors are chair and deputy of the infrastructure transport in environment committee thank you I mean this is another one which is really about finding the balance between competing aspects of in this case limited road space finding the balance between reliable journey times for bus passengers and hopefully then modal shift under PT versus a functioning local environment that works for local businesses and and local residents who choose to and who hopefully continue to use those local business facilities exactly like 've got a recommendation which clearly has been worked through in detail by the community board which is supported by the majority of the community board supported by the two councillors on that community board and in particular I note the particularly strong statements made by the the local ward councillor so I think this is one where it 's absolutely appropriate that we give significant weight to the local view and we 've heard that loud and clear might you want to close off the debate thank you oh sorry I didn 't see you there so yani and then Michael goes off to debate yeah thank you so much several points one is that I think we 've really got to get better at getting submissions in front of all of us this whole confused process where some people speak to the community board some speak people speak to the council there 's no hearing and we don 't even see the submissions from individuals I 'm really concerned with I 've raised this concern previously I think if we had the decision makers we should actually read in and we should all equally hear from people both good and bad around this project the other thing that I can support this project today is because of the budget escalation there are other projects I 'll just read you that ins was a power road which was an orbiter project project delayed due to escalating costs so you know while some projects have been put on hold for bus priority or bus public transport improvements other budgets are going way over in in having an impact so I think we really do need to actually think about the entire budget for PT and if we 're taking budgets off other projects that I think we really need a clear resolution not just rely on the ELT to make those decisions but actually we should be doing it in my view so we know what the impact does whether it means other things are delayed for longer or aren 't done to the scope and the standard that we expect or maybe in some cases things are aligned and so we get some cost-saving but the final piece of know like we 've tried this compromise options before don 't Pepin or erode and actually what we found was I think in hindsight personally it wasn 't worth doing because like basically we didn 't improve bus patronage we didn 't really improve bus journey time at all we just spent a lot of money and caused a lot of inconvenience for people and we 've got buses that duck in and out of traffic actually it just ends up being pretty neutral so for 1.8 million I 'm not convinced that the benefits of the scheme are gonna are gonna come through given what we 've heard in terms of the changes and also what we 've done previously so I won 't support it today I do think in future it should be noted that we should all get copies of submissions where we 're being asked to make decisions as decision-makers and everyone that wants to speak to an issue should either go all to the community board or all to Council but I don 't think we should have it mixed up I don 't you thank you just a few things the the submissions are public documents and are very accessible for every single person around these this chamber also I just want to touch on a couple of things I hope everyone does support the community boards recommendation and the community board have actually put a lot of time into this and work with a lot of people and we believe we have the right outcome for everyone and in there and I think if this goes through and we retain those nine parts I hope you continue use the pallino a black and white coffee cart ale and while your VA should also try Anytime Fitness poppin OE excellent jump potentially the piston Christchurch in our kitchen fantastic I just like to point out there was a there was a it was in Creek that all businesses are proposed us there was businesses that actually supported the plan I mean also businesses supported the community boards recommendation so you know when you have a look at what has actually been changed through this consultation both by the project team and the community think is going to be very beneficial for both bus users in the community thank you I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye against so that 's Yanni and Dion voting against and Erin so if we can just note those votes against and that 's carried thank you and thanks again to staff for answering some relatively detailed questions _"

    "text": "to patient we don 't have any public forum presentations this morning but we do have two deputations the first of which is from Peter Jasper relating to item 19 the Linwood east gate integrated transport study so Peter if you 'd like to come forward please so Peter thank you for joining us I 'm aware that you 're presenting to us this morning about some you know issues that you 've obviously got some some strong views on also now staff spoke to you before the meeting just regarding our standing order requirements there was a document circulated to his prior to this meeting which counselors have read which when I read that did contain some language that I wasn 't entirely comfortable with in the context of our standing order 12.2 so I would warn you that if language is used which is repetitious disrespectful or offensive as the chair I do have the ability to stop the deputation and our staff have spoken to you about that already I 'm certainly looking forward to hearing what you 've got to say this morning and and hope know we 're able to listen to you respectfully that 's fine so thank you very much indeed for joining us you 've got ten minutes and that would include any time that you might want to leave for questions thank you my name 's Peter Jasper this is my wife Ruth Carson in my talks in response to the Linwood Eastgate area integrated transport study and it 's particularly associated to the bus stops on the east side eastbound side of Buckley 's Road now we are just ordinary people who want to get on with our ordinary lives we don 't want to spend our time crawling through council documents trying to figure out what 's going on I need to uncover what appears to be a trail of secrecy in deceit we want to be able to trust the council too extensively sadly we feel this trust is unwarranted we feel we are being treated with the same content that EQC treated us with we know the council has a difficult time placing bus stops and people get grumpy no matter what you try to do but operated as a busy three-bay interchange and the council seems to be pretending it 's only a bus stop surely you can understand our feelings of utter disbelief and dismay over this we can 't sit back and allow it to go unchallenged if we do then what on the earth is going to happen next you must understand our dismay when a bus is parked over the drive not picking up or dropping off passengers parked while the driver is off chatting to his mate or sitting on the bench having a cigarette we believe also that at times the drivers nip up the driveway for a pee because their employer has failed to provide toilets nearby the report being presented currently says it 's two bus stops with a driveway in the middle well way we see it maybe it is and maybe it isn 't what are you really supposed to believe the reality is it 's being operated like a three Bay interchange proposed in the 2011 ably study with it 's insane justifications to force it into a space where it won 't fit can stop line will minimize the impact on the driveways owner works in everyday reality and how are we supposed to say thank you to every for not for proposing for not proposing to put shelters across the driveway common sense and common decency say you don 't build a busy interchange over a residential driveway it 's completely bonkers as it is during peak hours buses crowd out the stops in the driveway is often blah making entering and exiting extremely difficult currently the residents not infrequently have to drive around the block before they can gain access to their homes and one resident has had an accident due to bus activity yet the council and II can are proposing an increase in the frequency of buses and more routes which will use these bus stops with increased congestion access may become high on impossible this is totally unacceptable it 's just crazy we 're in the study or or any others in consideration whatsoever being and we 're in any of these studies or has any consideration whatsoever been given to the adverse environmental and social effects we outlined stink of urine they used to dump trash they used as a park for abandoned supermarket trolleys cyclists zipped through the narrow gap between the shelter 's and the road edge our property continues to be used as a toilet bus patrons gather in the driveway particularly in winter as it gets the late afternoon so often there we 're in headphones and you 're completely oblivious to the cars coming in and out of the driveway you can honk at them and they don 't hear you how is adding more shelters going to contribute to an attractive inefficient Network when the whole set up is already completely dysfunctional it would be irresponsible to spend right may and that ratepayer money to add more the council is on shaky ground and forcing the location of this bus interchange legally it looks like the stops are being used on woefully ethically the council goals of transparency clearly communicating to the public providing accurate information and a robust advice ring hollow and lack credibility morally entrenching a de facto interchange here lacks any shred of common sense or common decency towards desperate attempt to shoehorn an interchange where it just doesn 't fit if our experience is anything to go by it 's no wonder that people become skeptical and suspicious of council plans it doesn 't have to be this way granting the three requests we have made won 't cost the council anything and you don 't have anything to lose however you 'd have everything to gain there are solutions both temporary and permanent that can rectify this issue taking time to work through this sensibly rather than forcing an outcome war we will restore credibility to council ethics we want to see that common sense and common decency still mean something here in Christchurch those photos please now a single bus stop B two bus stops or C three bay bus interchange that 's right outside our house sorry outside our property that we own at 35 days right and I 'm off to have a chat to my mate and as you can tell from that there 's three buses filling that at the moment and that 's not even PPI mix okay is this a or D all of the above next I don 't think that needs any description and it smells as bad as it looks finally I 'd like to say please consent to our requests so this matter is not left to fester we all need to work together to resolve this matter then we will have a bus hub at this gate that contributes to an attractive and efficient public transport network that 's all thank you thank you very much and that does leave some time for questions are there any questions Sarah to do with the way that operated I 'm just wondering if you have raised those with a keen because they you so know that he can run the buses but from our point of view it 's the stops we the stops are located that are causing the bulk of the problem it 's the actual driveway in the middle of when it comes to people the best drivers stopping the buses over the driveway we 're not supposed to that kind of stuff actually I have time constraints you know I 'm not a it 's difficult enough at the moment finding the time and I think it 's partly the responsibility of the Christchurch City Council and he can to get together when I 've raised issues like this thank you any further questions so a lot of what you 've raised though it 's about driver behavior sorry it 's about driver behavior and following on from what Sarah was saying is there any way that we can help you to address these issues with a Kim given that they are you know it must be really frustrating and I 'm sure there must be ways that we can we can support you because this is not acceptable yes well that 's why I 've requested meetings so that we can talk with them like this is a very short time frame here so that we can actually talk with the appropriate counselors and staff so that we can come up with both temporary and permanent solutions to what 's going on there so we 'd be more than happy to you know have further discussions on how I can resolve the you can talk to or do you know who you 're going to be talking to well I 'm not sure no it 's been suggested that this is that the ite committee the chair of the ITP committee and I believe that the mere might be interested in what 's going on here because of your interest in public transport and you know generally some people who had some influence and helping that we 'd be more than in fact would be very happy to meet with him even more than just once so that we can that 's what the basis of our requesters and also that there 's no more expenditure the year until we actually resolve what 's going on thank you to Pauline you are the chair of the 80 committee your question we we do have some solutions but given the fact that we proposed the solution back in 2016 are reluctant to ear that before the council right now and that is partly another reason why we requested meetings outside yeah there are certainly some issues you 've raised through the deputation which show that there 's some activity going on currently which is undesirable and unacceptable and some of which may be able to be resolved in the short term and of course we need to be careful that whatever changes that we make to the way that buses use this area and to and public transport facilities in this area improve rather than exacerbate the sort of things that you 've shown us I mean you 've obviously got some local knowledge that 's going to be valuable in those conversations the way forward it would make sense to be able to pick that up you 've obviously got details which you 've provided to to our staff as you as you made this deputation today I think it would be good if somebody was able to get back in touch with you to set up an appropriate meeting so that we can and discussing more depth issues that you 've raised this morning and make sure that they are well taken into account in any changes that we might be making in this and in this area Tempe picture on etc and pay our page five of the documents we hear there 's the 2016 sorry this is the document that I okay that 's that picture there is directly from the ably study of 2008 the first one and it shows of the night this is one of the top of the page that should say 2008 that 's the one with the bus showing be moved to the glow keishon with a service station was alright so that brings us to the end of the ten minutes but what I certainly will do is request staff contact you to set up a meeting with appropriate staff and elected members to discuss the matters that you 've raised briefly today so the opportunity to understand those and to make sure that we take them into account in future decision-making in addition to looking at what we can do to make some immediate improvements if indeed that 's possible as has been noted some of its driver behavior some of it is other behaviors on the part of members of the public which are also undesirable we probably need to to make some improvements in both of those areas accessible thank you I just like to make it clear here too we don 't blame the drivers I mean when you 've got to go you 've got to go so it 's about provision of appropriate facilities all right thank you very much indeed for joining us this morning and certainly been a valuable opportunity to to hear the views of you know clearly people that have got some some local knowledge thank you thank you very much thank you so we now have our second deputation so this is Francesca Bradley and Kristensen from generation zero speaking regarding item eight the main North robust priority now it 's worth pointing out that this deputation is occurring in the context of generation zero not having addressed or engaged with the community board on this in the early stages of the process so thank you for joining us you have ten minutes and if you wanted to leave time within that 10 minutes for questions that 's entirely your choice thank you very much and we 're in strong support Road and would like to thank you for leaving our speak today as we missed our opportunity with the community board so generation zero is a nonpartisan usually at climate organization we champion evidence-based solutions and equitable actions to transition towards a carbon neutral RTO our and we wish to achieve this by working to what we wish to work to achieve this through success sustainable smarter transport livable cities and an independence from fossil fuels so your decision today to implement the bus priority changes is going to increase public transport efficiencies and help ease congestion on this main arterial road hitting in and out of the city we 're strongly in support of the council staffs report it 's recommending a new permanent northbound bus lane from poppin OE road from here Wood Road to Linden 's Road and this is going to result in an average bus travel time serving of four seconds during evening peak travel times so this is this this is hugely beneficial today we 're asking counsel to not support the pepperiness community boards amendment to retain car parks between humid Road and Hosain travel times it 's going to have it down to 42 seconds it seems insignificant but this is as I said before it 's a main route into town these this could greatly improve the efficiencies of getting into town and improve how attractive public transport will be in christchurch if you were to support this amendment it shows that there 's no real commitment to public transport priority getting more people to use public transport this is a priority that he can and counts we 've agreed to and the joint public transport committee and the proposed Canterbury regional public transport plan outlines that this will be addressed by providing greater priority for public transport on high demand routes of which may North Road seems obvious so today we would like you to enable an efficient public transport system by approving the staff report to install the new permanent northbound bus lane from here Wood Road to Linden 's Road and by doing this you have prioritized climate change action by helping Canterbury ends transition towards a zero carbon future thank you thank you very much you 'll from counselors Pauline yes yeah but then I understood that there was also a section of the bus parity Lane that will be coming towards town but yeah the issue here is getting out of town Thank You Jamie between road yeah and I think it was some concern obviously the retail frontages there do you have any comment or our thoughts around from what I could understand from reading the amendment these five that was my understanding and I I mean you 're right by the mall I if you want to provide car packing straight outside a shop for five minutes I 'm wondering what those customers can actually achieve these are car parks outside restaurants I don 't really see how how that can help the community when there are other opportunity there are car parking opportunities and all streets you are right by a major mall I just think that the benefits for public transport far outweigh the benefits of these five car parks went there are a lot more available in their area thank you any further questions all right thank you very much indeed we 'll come to the item that you 've been addressing later on in the agenda I 'll be running through the agenda with the community boards in the order it 's set out so we will come to that later and probably later this morning I would say thank you very much for joining us today thank you _"

a very successful year with the multicultural and strategy so congratulations to to the team on that and our community board fortunate enough to because we 're very multicultural we fund 12 or helped

also had the great pleasure at our meeting on the trees day xi to to present certificates of appreciation tubulin law fighting from neighbor are from community patrols Allen Burke from Scouts and

Kilmarnock enterprises used to be in Rick erdan which is now the home of the City Harvest Food Rescue so chill Manik Enterprise has moved yet from their van air and Wigram skies area and they 've also won an award from the Westpac Canterbury champion business winner so it seems it seems quite coincidental look there 's the link between that building which was the home of Kilmarnock enterprises or the sheltered workshops they were called white back in the day to you and that 's going to really good use down and Commander kinder prizes are moved out to with them so that 's that 's really good

    "text": "on the why papa papa nuit Ennis community board reports to Council so Emma as Deputy Chair you 're presenting this today thank you very much indeed for waiting and apologies for the delay arm aware that we 've got some two or three other community members in the back there that you 've been caring for as you 've been waiting so we appreciate that there will be the best-informed kids in the city about intersection improvements right so Emma thanks for being with us ten minutes over to you and I 'm just gonna run through a few of our highlights from the last month just a soft opening of the new sintel burns pavilion on scent albans pack it was a beautiful sunny day we had a small crowd public came along and and we talked about the history of the building and we unveiled the beautiful looking plaque that you 'll see up in the corner there and in the public we 're able to have a walkthrough of the building and so it was great to be able to celebrate that milestone and the rest going to have the grass usable by our December weather permitting and and really for winter sports next year we 're planning to have and match a big community celebration and with an official opening of the the new tooth in the pavilion and because it is a well-loved in much well we used park so we really want to make a big deal out of it so that 'll be hopefully in March on Tuesday of this week we had a community meeting in Richmond and the main focus of that was this North Richmond block road works and we held a meeting with the same community and June was quite heated and some unhappy people but we were able it was good to go back to them with this progress that we have been making a staff have been working really had to assist all these roads within this block unfortunately we have had to limit it to this block for now as we have to start somewhere and they have come up with a priority list and the first three reinstatements going to be under way but just after Christmas so that was really positive and encouraging and we 're also working really closely with closely with the new Richmond residents and business association and we 've got some great lines of communication with the community through them to us and the staff so we 're going to keep working on that and progressing that this is something new trust we had the great seed and plant swap at the papanoida library earlier last month and this was run over two days and basically the seeds and the seedlings were there for anybody to either swap or just take and by the halfway through the first day they they were pretty much gone so luckily the staff had kept a few aside and had to go and restock them and it was really great we supplied a lot of the seeds in the seedlings and then might attend poppin also helped us out with it so we 're really thankful for them and it 's something we 'll look at doing again and would encourage others to and then Eric our most exciting thing recently is the was found in the old community center when it was demolished in 2012 so we 've been waiting a while and slide were copies of the press and a little 10 times from July 1920 which is when that building was built and and also a lis a litter in a bottle which unfortunately we couldn 't open on the day it was stuck inside the bottle so it took another week from the museum staff to open it but and you 'll see these Alicia that was in it which it 's written by this an all-men 's mutual Improvement Association it names members who were part of that group when it first built the community building in Dover Street and 1867 and then it goes on to name the members from 1920 who were the ones that did that time capsule I 'm set was really exciting and weird the community involved here we had kids from two schools and you 'll see Jean near who 's well-known Auburn 's resident as well she helped open it and so that was really positive and good to be involved just briefly like to touch on the main road first priority project which you are going to be making your decision on today and just from a community broadly point of view we believe this was a very thorough consultation with large numbers of submissions and changes were made to the flames after that consultation particularly around the grasmere street signals we had deputations to our board regarding the loss of on street parking it 's the he would road end of the project and our recommendation takes into account the views of residents businesses and the wider community we feel we 've come up with a recommendation which limits the impacts on businesses and that most heavily part section and between he would Road in Winston Eve while also improving bus travel times we feel we 've listened to our community and are reflecting their view and I would just like to correct and what generation zero said earlier there are in fact and they amended but that we are saying we I 'm asking you to leave the passing there are actually nine parks which are currently P to were the ones that we have asked to be put in just around the corner on one Stern Eve and we hope you will go with our recommendation on that one thanks thank you very much so as I indicated earlier just in the interest of time we 'll deal with that pass a recommendation after lunch rather than immediately after this report as we normally would thank you very much indeed for that update are there any questions for Emma on this report Pauline you 're happy to move it Mike you 're having a second no questions okay so all those in favor say aye against that 's carried thanks very much indeed and once again thanks for waiting thank you _"

    "text": "thank you so if the if the rest of the finance and performance committee minutes could be dealt with I mean meeting could be dealt with in a similar fashion okay or taking I 'm taking a risk here Paul but I 'll get to you very shortly okay item 13 share persons report well we we did discuss this in great detail at the Finance Committee and we ended up with an amended resolution which was approved which RCC able to report to the council on any current considerations obviously and I 've spoken they 're coming in to see Council in October to really give a detailed briefing yeah especially for a lot of those counselors who weren 't here last time just on a kind of broader view of how the whole thing works what the trade-offs are the opportunity costs and happy to seconder Jonnie two things one is I did vote against it at the Finance Committee can I have that recorded it 'll be in the minute so it 's not these are the minutes the second question is I 'm just trying to gonna include any reference to SSL 's or not no I mean that 's that 's not what this is asking for information I mean when you 're jumping to I think part of the confusion is stuff that 's been in the media prior to the chairpersons report and these resolutions coming to us which talked about the desire to look at potential asset sales and I just want to be really clear that you know I personally would be quite horrified of the council if they are well to the media this is not specific this you know the last time we did this work was before the 2015 that 's the that 's basically the information including the date program so all of this has got to be you know in a you know a sequencing of these discussions is probably the important lesson learned but then it 's not what the purpose of the council table is not an opportunity for a discussion along these lines I just would like some understand I mean if this is going to be debated for a long time well question came through from another counselor about what the costs would be from CCA shell to do this work they 're doing this work they 're coming to report to us a workshop we 're having a workshop first and they will formally report to the council on on the work that the work that 's being done I mean it 's just this is not the resolution that went to the finance and performance committee from the chair this Brazil risk was resolved by the finance and performance committee and that 's why it 's here clarification I mean this is not the recommendation that came in the chairs report this is a recommendation that came out of the committee CC HL quite rightly is doing and be confident in his ability to deliver to counsels expectations and the sequencing I think it 's fair to say was unfortunate it would have been good if councilors has had the information from CC HL try it and considering the matter raised in the Java matters raised in the chairs report I absolutely agree you know what may or may not our job today is to look at the resolution that 's in front of us which is to get an update from CC HL I think it 's reasonably we would expect that I think it 's reasonable to expect ECHL to do any work that they 're doing to me this is very very simple and by proving this today actually all we do is confirm a process which which would have been happening in any case anyone I mean I I can 't support this this is something that we already have a performance reporting framework with CC HL we 've just adopted our financial strategies account so two months ago and now we 're getting another briefing about a capital release strategy and and some more work that 's just doing on its financial strategy but the timing of this as as totally related to the suggestion in the media that asset sales be considered and I can 't see why spending more money on consultants more time and resources through CC HL when we 've got other priorities as a city why this makes any sense advice we 've had privacy around asset sales has been quite clear we 've spent wasted in my view a whole bunch of money with the failed city care sale I 'm actually gonna prove it 's not what the papers that 's not what the resolutions about so and this you 're prepared to debate the resolution I didn 't want to interrupt you Yanni I 'm really regretting actually doing this but can you can you just complete your I 'm not gonna support those I think we should be open and transparent and if people want to have a consideration of s it sells fine let 's get a paper is for things like capital release to be used and in other processes underway at leaks at the exclusion of the public of asset sales have been considered and I would much rather have a straight forward direction to see CHL if council wants to make a decision whether they look at asset sales I 'd rather that was the case where we could clearly indicate whether we support that or not rather than a resolution that think is the issue that people are wanting to raise it wasn 't me that raised it it was raised through the media and that 's why I 'm responding the way I am I 'm just be honest I 'm just saying that the reason I 'm not gonna vote for this as the process I think that the workshop with CC HL with all counselors would have been better to have prior to this coming to Council and I would have had a better understanding of what we 're discussing and where that the strategy is going so I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no I Tim and yummy _"

    "text": "okay so then I want our final item item 26 the metropolitan discretionary response fund so Nicola you 're here for this one the reports reasonably self-explanatory are there any questions on all well Nicola did you want to make any comments there any questions on this report does it get the parade done the other funding they 've been able to secure at this point in time so have we spoken to them and do we know that this will actually get the parade up and up and running will we get them back again next month it 's my understanding that we haven 't so if it turns out that the 20,000 isn 't sufficient if we were to approve that today what would they do would they then come back to us for an additional amount would it be open to them to come back for an additional amount to the discretionary response fund but this is for the arena and operational costs so they would have some time to secure other funding as well and we have advised them that they may not receive the full with some information about other sources of funding there might be stirred so at 20,000 do we know that they 're sufficient for them to deliver the event sponsorships and insurance costs of storage of the flights in their operating costs throughout the year all right so the twenty thousand dollars it she takes it up to eighty five thousand dollars that we look granted five thousand already towards rent rates and insurance from another council so while it doesn 't well the tweenty doesn 't sound like actually taking it up to eighty five same thing that we 've already given the money for so this is already a top up on what we 've already given them so I 'd be reluctant to you know do something and these I 'll come back again if it 's not enough come be you know if it 's not enough we 've already seed sixty five I 'd be reluctant to go over the Tweedy staff recommendation knowing that we were really short on phones and the Metropolitan funding round and they were likely to get other people coming to 's continue with questions for a moment Tim budgets from them and work out because it 's not gonna go away and it 's one of those things that has been so we have done it over the years I remember seeing the every year their budgets I mean one of the biggest costs as their storage if we 're looking for opportunities you remember the gymnastics yeah and I know that and they property people think that they may have somewhere else that they could run edge so we had that the question is obviously they needn 't major sponsor for the actual event need to look at other here 's a funding is it was council wish to fund it in a sustainable way in part of the funding review also be looking at these ones that we fund every year and do we look from multi-year approach to funding them rather than year on year application by application sponsor the real cost is a storage is you know all right thank you Yanni and then Jimmy yeah agreed so where we got to with the storage because years and yeah we like do we have a kind of time frame for a resolution to that can we get some information back on this I mean I remember there was some discussion through the chemical TP submissions and certainly from memory seems like a conversation has been going on for two or three years it 's been ongoing for some time and there might be other options but we 're working with we 've actually approached Christchurch and Zed who are very keen on attracting sponsorship to events and you know they are they providing support they 've got a lot of events funding now are they able to contribute or help this is this is more of a community so cricket cricket playing rugby guys with about 10,000 people if they 're lucky as the men don 't put the scissor it 's got a hundred thousand people sounds very odd as a matter of as a matter of fact this is you know in terms of the split between community events and major events this is a community event whether we agree with that or not by council not my Christchurch in crisis and they 'd also have budgets and have advice and services that they provide to many different groups so you 're basically saying that there 's no opportunity for the crusher stands there to work with them given that this is a community event and community events are the responsibilities of council and that we 've asked quite sure Chan said through those statements of intent to focus on major events this is not within the area of operation of Christchurch and Zed we 've just had a panel meeting so currently and the figures are slightly different to those on the report there 's currently one hundred and thirteen thousand eight hundred and sixty-three okay so Jimmy had a question so I 'll come to Jimmy 's question strengthen community is the same material different criteria response most of the items that can 't_''_473.52 be funded and you know this is the first application they 've made to the discretionary Response Fund and they 've not made a previous application to the strengthening communities fund but because we are all aware mine go in the none zero for their whether they 're eligible to apply so no it 's not in relation to the application that we 're considering this afternoon if you were aware of groups who might want to apply to this fund and you wanted to seek advice from staff as to whether they could or not and that 's a conversation that obviously you 're able to take offline what we here this afternoon to discuss is whether we 're going to grant twenty thousand dollars to the South great Vicki you 've indicated your move is there a second of a twenty Sarah okay is there any debate I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye against that carried thank you _"

    "text": "so improvements so we 're aware that the Cathedral it 's an incredibly busy and we 'll have to manage that the public realm approach we 're discussing here today first and foremost we 'll addressing a small safety concerns and including some improved lighting on the north side which is super important with the imminent opening of today event in the bow of the project let 's cooperate regenerate Christchurch vision so none of us will be contrary to that five point one expands on the plant southeast which is the old beams inside the next can be tinted by sparks boys house down there also the former aliens in on the opposite corner the southwest corner and it also a great Australian Lane there 'll also be some improvements in front of what was the old owners hotel I 'm sure and looking at a huge increase in foot traffic also you 'll note that the intention is to reuse as many existing materials so this planned pre engagement with stakeholders and the design will be a consultation so the committee supported this happy to move do I I 'll do the question arms is there consultation on this we 're just talking about that so it 's not clear in the repeating scope but given the time frame in the reuse of materials I would think that we would want to make sure that it 's targeted consultation potentially with simplicity Business Association in depending on where we get to with considerations that you might make around the central city action plan there may also be some other key targeted consultation okay and the other one I mean I 'm just in regenerate crash dish so obviously yeah I 'm just seeing this but I just wanted to know what actually is happening here as and is it is it in line with the regenerate Christchurch plan because there 's a massive difference in budgets just a little bit confused with this well it 's why through regenerate crash yeah we 're gonna be important to work and collaborate I mean we 're pretty much three million dollars here the regenerate christchurch plan come to us formally I know and I 'm just worried that we do something else I 'm just to the to our request as a result of the submissions that we receive from building owners during the LTP we doesn 't we asked have to go away and do this work as a priority even I 'm just confuse it may be you know are we going to be redoing something in the future around this no there may be something that gets redone in the future but if we don 't do these areas now then they 're gonna be like they are when brand-new buildings open and a creases immensely so I just think it 's a it 's an I mean I just look at the report and I actually don 't know what 's going to be done we don 't use because they 're going to scope the public realm improvement projects including the reuse of existing materials and investigate new alumns elements where it 's cost-effective to do so so I mean it 's the network has being done Fitz I mean at that night if you want to love that we had this is this is then Yanni this is the question I want to get some clarity around is any of this work temporary will it be undone because of regenerates vision so we would anticipate that because of the construction it is going to be undertaken in the square over the next seven to ten years the weeks which will concentrate on well Erie in front of to runner has largely been done in in part of the square between Wooster Street in Colombo Street will last for at least that period of time so 7 to 10 years we would anticipate these weeks I can 't give you advice like at that time in what the council will want to do at that time but these weeks could last beyond it as well my question is 3.6 million dollars we 're about to approve right now how much of that potentially is only going to last 10 years we just exactly be a minimum where you 're going to have to lift there so some of the foundation works it will be done as part of this contract will last firm if you 's some issues around that what we 're doing is enough to actually lift it the problem is that we don 't actually have the full plans of what they 're going to do with the cathedral and all the rest but we 're also going to try and make it an attractive looking place and if they can incorporate any of those ideas they 're rejean Christ Church of God in their plans they are going to try and do that so if we can do that successfully it might stay there for twenty years or thirty years but I appreciate that I 'm just struggling with the fact that I can 't get a real answer around of the three point six million dollars actually potentially there 's going to be a significant amount that will be wasted cause I 'll have to be redone in ten years it 's just trying to get an idea of my mind before I vote on this actually how much is potentially just gonna be there for a short period you 're on scoot you see do some working around Oh just trying to get are we able to get confirmation that the spend here is not is not going well we haven 't even received the the report from reading there is 15 to 20 years life left in the paving that will be used reused in cathedral square so that is the that is the life of the surface but of course as dave has just identified the works the the rear the recontouring of the square once it 's done it 's done so actually the access to those buildings is secured for beyond that period of time because we 've actually made the levels work from the buildings into the public realm but just just looking at some of the sticking to that north no sorry south with corner is there any area that you will reinstate the the paving stones reusing them that could in the future be set aside as it has been in the plan for grass or is that on the other side of the road that the plan which you which council hasn 't yet formally really received so so depending on do once all of the construction and the square is completed then then there may be some reworking of some of that but that I guess I would suggest that that 's a financial and a decision of council at that time right so yeah okay well we 're not going to be in a position in the next ten to fifteen years of making a decision and relation to revamp of that part of their area okay I thought the thing that people got quite positive was the introducing of the Greenway particularly in this corner so I just don 't understand why we wouldn 't actually be doing even if we just did that chunk that quarter of the square to the region plan why wouldn 't we just do it I think that 's one of the key things we 're going to look at and so that the key elements are the paving renewals and we 've got to look at lighting in terms of infrastructure because we don 't meet a level of service at the moment but than if you 've walked through Cathedral 't look very good it isn 't an inviting environment and we 'll certainly look at the greening concepts for regenerate because I think that was one of the positive things that came through the consultation that people wanted to see a more friendly environment in cathedral square so that absolutely one of the first things we 'll look at this report is about allowing us to initiate the project understand the scope come back to you with our priorities and and and seek soundings from the council and the community that we 've got it right so this is about initiating a project just to we haven 't got resources working on this at the moment and so until we initiate the project we can 't understand it fully and we can 't come back it 's kind of the process for it to come back to us before we go because as the point that 's been made it 's quite hard I mean a lot of the tick 's actually sounds quite good reusing staff being cost-efficient getting synergy but because we can 't actually see it oh cool go away and you know spend the money well any secret confusion over the level engagement I would personally feel a lot more comfortable I think they should be public engagement regenerate publicly engaged I don 't think just limited stakeholder targeting is the right way to go for anything to do with Cathedral Square given you know how we 've just seen this morning that a wide number of people have an interest so I 'll just like to ask if there was consideration giving to a resolution that specifies you know some sort of draft when coming back to us at some stage I mean that was very helpful Lee actually so if we take number three approve the funding for the project from the LTP capital project ID 273 5 because it 's that 's what you need to kick things off the square and surrounds and why don 't we just make that subject to a report back on the proposals so on the on the design in the proposals no it 's it allows you to start it it 's approved the funding initiate here the project thank you and and then say and request a report back so initiate the project instead of subject to a report bait and request a report back for confirmation of the final of the design and the proposals well it 's just the desired proposals isn 't it and request a report back for confirmation on the design proposals and that way I mean as region christchurch has to come to us you come back to us with a specific one if it 's on all fours with we 're we 're day we 're heading in this particular area then I actually don 't know that it 's required to go out for another set of consultation but it may well be that there 's there 's no harm and just putting it out on that in Tunisia and asking people what they think of it following on from the presentation this morning it did occur to me that one of the issues with the citizens memorial is the ability to have some some use of it in the immediate to short term future or other 's work is actually looking at the formal waters hotel and has in that vicinity is this scope to kind of look and say you know we could put something together that would enable people to utilize that for events or is that just too difficult no that 's exactly what Lee just just expanded upon there was to look at the lighting and also from the lighting you also look at power as well for events and for ensuring that we 've got activation in those areas as well so I was meeting very specifically around the outer side and the southeast Southwest at the moment microphones if you 're gonna talk Warner 's hotel because on the same side as the Senate are yeah it 's again this is about developing working with the developers who are actually working in the southeast and Southwest corners right now I presume as we as we work through this put this investigation into what we can do we will be advising back to Council on what we can do in the northwest and the northeast corners as well at that but again it 's an understanding of what other stakeholders in the square just follow on from there if you 're gonna talk about events then I 'd suggest you if you could involve the event production companies not council alone so much but it would be really good because we envisage those that aren 't involved in the industry and where they should actually be and what they should be would be really handy from the stat it 's a really good point one of the things we 've heard is that the cost of actually holding events in Cathedral Square is really high because you have to bring in generators and there 's no infrastructure so that is actually prohibitive to actually activation so it 's it 's completely right yep yes good tonight in regards to the spark building area the the broken area the broken tiles that are there at the moment was was were they paid for by the was there any income from the last you know from the demolition of the benzene building yeah say we had to prove who did that damage demolished the external the the building itself they worked from a certain point and they had at that point create a platform they were working on prior damage the damage that we 're talking about in particular switch between the two major planters that damage was done in two zero days unfortunately and in the rice you 're saying that the spot buildings raised a little bit from that area but what about from here if it 's true it 's same same so we need to lift up here if it 's true well we are anyway naturally we 'll come to it to suit the new levels floor levels that 's interesting well is that been consulted on through the actual being taken into account through the work that 's going on okay and the other question I had is that the Cathedral reinstatement the the the the act can basically says that they can utilize the entire Cathedral Square so we confident that if they need to are we confident that the areas if we 're going to improve any of these areas that it 's not reinstatement joint-venture to understand the sit down area the the vehicle movements in but of course if this week has done the Nerissa there is an understanding of the condition of this environment and effectively there could be a before and after conditions who they undertake and should that be required and it may be something that 's helpful for council to have in relation to other developments so that would be in speak to your point around who would pay for any damage weird stare sorry I 'll turn on a mic so that request a report back for conformational and design proposals yep good all right well I 'll put that motion yep sorry Aaron oh yeah you know yeah sorry I put the motion and people call for debate yep so any any anyone wants to speak to it so I 'm gonna have to go shortly I don 't don 't really want to mess Oh anyway no no I 'm not I 'm not saying you because here are lots of other speakers now so so I 've got you full warning you moved it for the point that might race before it 's I 'm reluctant to spend any more money in the square Eva that 's not essentially permanent in my lifetime there 's been I think three or four makeovers of the square all costing millions of dollars and I have a picture I just looked at of cobblestones that are still deed straight the laid in Greece 1800 years ago so I 'm sure we could lay some in the square that could last a while and this we 're just buying I 'm soft stone or cheap stone or something but we do it once and hip something were proud of that just stays there for lifetimes and it 's it 's strange that we spend money and then redo it and resplendent so there is one reason I won 't other than that I do support those buildings going in I do support the rejuvenation of the square it 's the heart of our city but we 've got to get it right and only spend the money once this rebuilds taken way too long and it 's costing is just insanity in my book Phil thank you um I 'm very supportive of just getting on getting on with us um it no one wants us to take longer then it should I understand from the reporters a spark building is opening the middle of next year we have to support support those people as stakeholders as well as the other ones so you know everyone wants air in a city god we want people to come we want the events so we just have to get on and do this actually thank you doesn 't mean that it 's money wasted we know that we need to make the heart of our city both attractive for people to come and stop and shop in coffee and attender beans and for the businesses who 've invested money and building in the area of the square in spite of the state of the Cathedral our resident survey showed that people especially women do not feel safe walking through the CBD at night in the city and if we want a vibrant CBD as soon as possible we need to terraces to the Theatre Royal through the square at night and all of those different things and we need good lighting to do there tend to do that we need funding we need places that aren 't hidden and shadows and if we want people back in our cvd they need to feel safe and it needs to be attractive and we need to help those businesses as well deal the only reason I will support this today is because of exactly that reason that the Cathedral Square is a little bit dark at night in safety and our central city is absolutely important and that 's something that a lot of people have been saying to us over the last little while the having to do this work because of of the buildings that are being built there and needing to pay for them to raise the level of our of our ground because of you know they 're building I do struggle a little bit with so I mean a little bit juvey us about sort of some of that stuff but I 'd like to see that of what we 're going to be doing this so that we can actually sort of have a have a visual ideas so that we could actually tell people Mike thank you I do committee meeting I do have concerns obviously the budget we have for the square is not there great when you look at the vision that 's been put forward and it 's really important I guess that we use this money wisely and we hear time and time again from the community do it once and do it right I 'm going to support this because of the inclusion of three that will actually come back to us for us to have a look at before actually gets done I think that 's really important the square does need some work it 's actually making sure that what we do in there actually is going to last a long long time we 've got to make our dollar go as far as possible yes the square needs to be tied up these places around the obviously right now it 's just very very untidy and but and we 're not talking small amounts of money here we 're talking lots of money for something that is not going to last a long long time but with the inclusion of three I will support this before I come to you Pauline I am gonna say something that I wasn 't going to but I think this is critical you know we cannot afford not to support these major businesses that are investing in our our city you know if I were a private business owner and I 've been given a big chunk of change as a result of an insurance payer would I have put all of my money and two building into Cathedral Square and the state that it 's in these businesses have asked us to front up and fix the entrances to their buildings we 've heard staff say the buildings are higher because of the I guess the the flood levels that they 're required to build we 've required them to build to those levels they 're doing it right we need to back them up you know we 've had that are faced with in the CBD for heaven 's sake they said light up the city it was one of their key messages to us they said make sure that the place is inviting that people were able to enter and join in and the events I 've listened to TIMSS Kendrick long enough to know that the events have to have a reason for bringing people into the into the center of our city and the best way to do that is to provide the you know the infrastructure to support those events and also to have events that bring in children and when you 've got a new brand new library in the middle of our square it 's going to be such an attractor you know I just don 't think anyone should underestimate what learner is going to bring to the center of the city so the city has invested the private businesses have invested and we need to make this investment in as Marcus seed we 've got a report back for confirmation on the design proposals the region position is going to be from that along with the reuse of materials I 'm really looking forward and I think the challenge I want to put to star has come back with something brilliant and will love you for it sorry Vicki in yarny and then Pauline when we looked at this one of the things that 's really important about Cathedral Square is that it is a huge footpath so we 're actually doing massive footpath repair here and if you look at it now and you try walking on some of those areas in the square they 're bumpy they 're dangerous if you 're taking anybody on a mobility scooter errand or anything like that it is incredibly dangerous if you 're taking kids and pushed ears or anything that is not a good place to be at the moment so that the major footpath that is the square needs to be done up the lights need to be there this is actually where a heap of people are going to be walking and if we can incorporate some greenery that 's great you don 't need to incorporate the risk ever be adopted just in terms of getting three million dollars worth of basic work done so that people can actually walk around the very heart of their city this seems to me to be a no-brainer yeah yeah I just wanted to support the comments that were made by a councillor Davidson you know would have been reluctant but we 've got three so I 'll just say today too that we 'll get the report that can come back I really do look forward to the greenery you know for me seeing kids playing hacky sack and the square again would be perfect because it just give an example of people using the outdoor space particularly in summer with nice grassed areas and you know I just think we need to just ensure when we get the report back that it does along with what region have proposed and that there won 't be a waste of money going forward because I think it is important and we just saw the brilliant presentation today earlier at Council from you know young people that are doing amazing stuff bringing think you know if we build on that energy than doing this is actually really important to help with that so I support thank you Pauling we owe it to these private investors to support them and this is all about the public realm we are got to improve that amenity we 're food that we 're into doing the billion here to make it functional in three point six million years it 's a lot of money but when you 're looking at doing things like drainage infrastructure in foundation works those things which will last for many meaning is in permanent groups and if she doesn 't go that far so in also this is part of the cost she fifty percent from the crown so you know we 're looking at the square what 's happening particularly in this quarter you 've got all these developments and the huge increase in employees that will be coming into the local visitors will be coming in especially with tirana anything we 've got our tourists and tourism order 406 million dollars last year we have to help the salinity nightly tried to walk through there so I 'm really excited about this actually I really am I 'm looking forward to the design coming back I think it 's something we absolutely have to do so excellent I shall put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's carried parent queuing and that motion is carried thank you very much

    "text": "and I love the anticipation stuff that was really brilliant dress to the parking policy I some please treatment yeah page three one item 21 has been to a tea so Pauling would you like to introduce yeah okay so this came too busy and so just just to point it out this is a suburban packing policy it 's not the central city and it 's been formed using the feedback from community engagement in 2016 so that 's aiming to shape how we allocate street space and how we manage on street parking demand if you look at 5.10 it outlines nine main issues in policies seeking outcomes which include prioritizing road space managing high demand areas things like wizard and zoning permits mobility access improvements safety improvements etc and please note that the issue of parking on rooms has not passed this is it 's been covered in their traffic and parking by 2017 so we 're just seeking to improve this this policy goes out for consultation feet that was already sorted in September 2016 and this has been used to okay does anyone want to a question Oh what am I here I 'll put the motions yep I really appreciate the work that 's gone into this from my experience on council one of the worst things we can do is if something comes up that 's going out to the community that you don 't agree with is to change it and then get submissions and then put it back to how it was with what you didn 't agree with so there 's a number of things in here that I 'm really concerned about you know we hear a lot about the Central City and and how hard it is for people to access it I can say that there 's also a huge amount of suburban shopping centers that are really struggling at the moment and part of the issue and concern that they have as we 've seen through the master plan process is the on street parking so I 'm just really mindful of the impact that reducing that parking even further it 's having on some of our very local small businesses in our suburbs I 'm meters into the suburbs and we start charging for parking in the suburbs but I think it 's far better for council to be transparent and put this out and seek feedback rather than modify that today with the risk that it would come in at the end of the process when people weren 't clear that that 's what was being proposed so I will vote for this to go out for consultation not because I endorse the things that are in it I do think the commercial center fact sheets that we 've had provided through our strategy and planning unit are actually actually quite excellent but there 's some really concerning things in there and we just need to think how we can support those suburban centers as well not not just in what could be seen as a negative message our borders she just in the middle of dealing with the Woolston village master plan even though we 've reinstated some of the car parking I think the again overwhelming number of submissions including many from local businesses raising strong concerns at the impact of the of that through things like the skirt works which have going on for a long time so just wanted to raise those points but to explain why we voting for this to go for a consultation but sewing I don 't agree with everything all right I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed saying right it 's carried thank you very much _"

    "text": "now the next one is earthquake-prone buildings priority therapies and routes consultation so you weren 't here for this one either David you were okay was anyone at the regulatory performance term were you there for this would you like to introduce the report this is your moment very clear and I just want to say love the tie in the middle yeah you 've been trying to keep away from the suits but until done this is a bit of work that really needs to be done and busted can probably fill us in far better than I can [Laughter] mr. Wright thank you this is as a result of the changes to legislation last year introduces some mechanisms to effectively have the time frame some buildings have to remove the earthquake proneness as so that there is own definition in the act around priority buildings and there 's six levels of priority the first four are basically a building type which is defined in the act the the last two these are the thoroughfares in the routes and effectively the mechanism allows us to identify what we see roadway or the like which emergency services in others would need to use an emergency and that could be obstructed by an unreinforced masonry building in the thoroughfares areas of heavy pedestrian cycling sort of traffic yep that we can also ask for reduction in time frame if we if we designate as a priority so I think we 've been out in how to talk to quite a few colleagues in terms of transport fire place ambulance and the like around the around the priority routes and we 've also had a look through the three that different parts of city in terms of thorough fears and we 've put them on a map and there must be some way to yeah this map is being used as part of the proposed consultation so the information that is getting sent out will allow people to to go to the site and put an address in or zoom in on a particular area to get a bit of definition of where the with the hearers and we are we 're fully hoping for ending carrying lots of engagement and identification particularly in terms of the areas and even even buildings the case needs be very good I mean in terms of the consultation I 've been good good to know that you are going to sort of make some deliberate attempt to contact those that have kind of advocated for the the legislative change you know the and brows and people like we 're you know to kind of reach out for a you know to put on a submission honor this the consultations through the special consultative process is pretty comprehensive yeah I 'm just quite keen to know that there 'll be a deliberate reach out to the people that have indicated a specific interest in this matter I can confirm that I have thank you very much Dion Amin Yanni you know it 's just I was just looking at the map and I was just wondering the the roots are the strategic ones in and out of the city as Hills Road considered one of those strategic routes it 's just one of the big games in the is it only specific if this prime buildings the consultation process we could add streets that 's correct yeah in-seok in the public the public can have a say yeah the Forest Service police ambulance in civil defense we 've met with everyone and these were the routes identified from that process it 's probably fair to say that the you know like you were indicating it does look like a bit of a gang you know you know the way people travel but anyway Jonnie just related to that the thing that surprised me was that the cycle major cycle routes aren 't on there and I would have thought that they would actually be places we really would want to protect because you know yeah it just seemed to me an obvious one that wasn 't don 't know if there 's if they were considered if they were ruled out while if not is there something we could look at and I 'd be kind of reluctant to add them and following submissions because we 'll probably get told it 's too big a change and we 'd have to reconcile full site full cycle the thoroughfares pedestrian access ways I don 't know I don 't know if the fires it was the riding bikes sorry justjust hampstead so you 've got high pedestrian areas so that 's why the the CBD is so you know high cyclist areas I would have thought our soccer routes would probably be you know in time that 's where people gonna be cycling usually I can 't quite see if you take some of the ones in the four hours I mean the 4l just is an arbitrary space and some of those streets won 't have a lot of pedestrians on them but you know some well but but most of the most of the cycle routes that I be aware of don 't have any buildings that could collapse onto them yeah I don 't_''_493.12 I don 't know because I don 't know all the detail but so there 's no building we 're not worried about buildings around the cycle routes as basically what you 're saying because we don 't think there 's many buildings there though so we have we do there was buildings on it as well but we know about at the moment so something could ask when could cut of each way but it 'd mean probably pretty unlikely at the paper makes it clear that it 's um that it 's there are two elements one is any part of any unreinforced masonry building that could fall from the building and an earthquake and that 's your parapet external wall Brenda and fall onto any part of a public road footpath or other thoroughfare that a territorial authority has identified under section 133 a of two a and the second one is a building that a territorial authority has identified under Section data dollars having the potential to impede a transport route of strategic importance so the mechs are around the transport routes of strategic importance but the paint boats are about the the buildings of that right you 've got that the priority theraphy is we are there with their higher what we 're anticipating is higher foot traffic in cycle traffic that could be a case of buildings closer to the to the boundary that the main represents here right so yeah I mean it yeah I think I don 't know that yeah well through the consultation process I 'm sure a few things will come out for the staff have gone and worked with emergency services cause it 's the priority and the since as you know a prime building so if there 's no earthquake-prone buildings or high buildings or buildings close to a safer way or a hills road or whatever there 's no point heading it in here you know because if you 're talking about cycle routes or certain roads you might as well put them all in and then that 'll just be ridiculous that this is being consulted on with the specialists that need to get to places but as certainly covers the cycleway ii but as specifically about impeding a transport route of strategic importance of the building were to collapse in an earthquake so it 's not it 's not just the the you know a veranda or the front piece or this is the building would collect and what it would do to a our partners who are the fire service police and ambulance service so that 's the key here and through the consultation maybe community boards will want to highlight this to their communities yeah so thank you tell me how does some once this has gone through and you know there is an agreement reached on on haratz how it 's done paradeen people that have got buildings on those strategic routes how are they then assist do we have to then ask them to do a detailed engineering evaluation of their buildings we already served notices to a lot of them have been sue notices with a 15 year period and a caveat that one sense process has been completed that timeframe may in fact reduced to seven and a half years right so they know that this is a process the ones the ones may know about okay so Tim 's moved it and serious seek and did it so sorry I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carry thank you good _"

up overlooked yeah so can you take care of lives in the meetings and you just because we don 't see CHL directors so you yeah do it right now yeah don 't worry it 's gonna take one second you can use remain you 're only gonna come back in the seat okay so item 30 okay so what the AGM Wednesday the 14th appoint a proxy and alternate and agree to direct the proxy an alternate to vote in favor of the matters to be put to the shareholders I 'm happy to put a motion right so number nine review of the gambling until they 've been new policy now they 're came through reports and you were away for that one so was anyone on regulatory performance there cuz I know Jimmy 's away zero zero was there okay do you want to introduce it yeah it 's pretty straightforward this was a couple of and it 's pretty straight but we 're just we 're just same it 's just keep the existing one for a further three years and then review again it 's pretty straight then you 'll move that way yeah absolutely do I have a second up a bit Andrew David in 2015 and I really think we are at the stage where we need to actually talk to our community and see what their view was a I note under 5.4 that there was a and through a short questionnaire nineteen responses were received and that 's a pretty small sort of assessment to be basing this policy so I 'm going to vote against it and signal if the motion was lost that I would be proposing a special consultative process to issue okay so Sarah um I completely understand we 're Dave 's coming from CalSTRS coming from and the our communities are really struggling for funds and having to apply to lots of different places including but while the availability of the funding from gambling is dropping in the city what that is doing consequently that people who would have gambled it away otherwise and so the key thing here is that money stays in the pockets of people instead of going into gambling and we get better health and well-being outcomes and we have more money back in the community where it belongs that can then be spent on community activities and that was one of the key things that was raised and it 's why we 've decided plus I think the important paragraph was 5.16 despite the declining venue and Machine numbers christchurch continues to have a higher ratio of gaming machines per head of population than the national average and has hit one of the highest rates across the major cities of New Zealand with only Tehran having more I have no problem with them continuing the policy issues I guess connected or not connected one of which is the number and location of gambling machines and the social Hamlet 's dumbo those gambling machines the other is community funding and improvements that could be made in the way the community funding is distributed and access to community funding and those outcomes of the current model but to run an argument that says that because there 's a need for more community funding we should change the policy around the location and pokies essentially with less regard to the social outcomes of that I would rather see the two separate issues social harm done by gambling as one which is what this is really about and the need for community funding and how that might best be managed as a totally separate issue that we would look at in his own you 're entitled to a brush for packaging oh no no you 're not yeah if you didn 't move it yeah say yes he debated or did you just oh I see okay sorry sorry I 'm just losing losing touch with reality here um I just I want to make once one comment to that and and in a way it 's to pick up on on something that that I know David is aware of because I was the impede for Christchurch East when this happened but there was there were a number of gaming machines and a surely and there was an ability to move the gaming machines to eddington Raceway which is a half of them to Edington Raceway the policy stopped it from happening and so moving the machines away from an it from an area a residential area and into the a gambling environment as in the Raceway actually seemed to me to be a positive outcome but the the policy didn 't allow for any any exceptions to be made and that you know that I would have thought that in the context of even a simple review of that even if we weren 't reviewing all of it just simply asking whether there was a degree of flexibility that could be written into the policy that would enable a good outcome like that you know it did seem to me that it was just a little bit too strict so that would have been my contribution if I 'd been on the committee but I wasn 't so I 'm making the contribution here and that will obviously support whatever council determines excellent I was hoping it was it was raised during the committee decided that it wasn 't going to happen I wasn 't like you to happen in a way anytime in the future again like that and there it didn 't warrant reviewing that policy thank you all right well I 'll pop the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's carried in that 's David East and Aaron Cohen thank you _"

    "text": "Carrie thank you very much so we 've done yeah number 19 critical judgments estimates and assumptions and 2018 yes this is a very clean audit report which is really good there are a couple of minor issues I will draw your attention to place item it 's number five in just a couple of counting treatments the main one really is the treatment of the land transfer or land and buildings transfer to the auditory community housing trust audit New Zealand did raise this as an issue that in their view the transfer of properties should be classified as help help to sale tomorrow in our meeting and we need something else otherwise that the main things are there you know pretty big rebounds and remember every time we revalue upwards you know that 's more stuff that needs to be assured to replace and also the parks had a revaluation an increase of seventy six million dollars so those are sort of the main issues we 'll be meeting to discuss the annual report tomorrow and it should be yeah that 's it so yeah it 's on mean this will be an issue do you want to just comment on there yeah just just one further comment on what the we have talked significantly with them the auditors about the the track community trust and we 've actually agreed between the two parties that it as bitter as to remain within our property plant and equipment for the foreseeable future until a final decision was made or terms agreed as to where that goes so therefore remains within our PPP which they 're not not held for sale so the kit will be discussing that further tomorrow but the key key finding is that it 's not a current asset anymore it 's a long-term it it it remains here until the terms are agreed the waters for me I know that it doesn 't impact on this year but it will impact next year if we don 't resolve can we I mean given that we 're going through this consultation at the moment if that 's gonna have significant rating impact I think we really need to be aware of what comes means for a okay I mean it right so that 's completely separate there is time for resolving these things so and just under 5.10 5.0 effectively there 's twenty eight million dollars basically which we 're possible yeah that 's the second tranche of houses or properties to be transferred to the trust were to occur the that was the anticipated capital value that has a fair value of 24 million dollars as if you do a fair value assessment of those properties we 're working through all the ramifications of the transfers from the trust and we have further work tomorrow on it and therefore we 'll be coming back to this committee with what actually it 'll be doing okay and did you want to comment on the whole this frame and even River precincts and what the conditions are this is a if we put this in here because we believe that some of the transfer of the south frame in these frames imminent actually hasn 't happened and they 're going through the full sub-divisional plans associated with it releasing the titles it 's currently sitting with the and it 'll be transferred across it it 's just the process of that subdivision it 's the risk for us as that we don 't have to clear a value now but we do have to do it later we 've we 've treated within our financial statements all the stuff coming from otaku row as a contingent as it is noted rather than being disclosed with a value so we say that all of that is subject to conditions precedent which will be all the details so it 's it 's it 's in our annual report under contingent assets transferred but we know it 's coming yeah yeah all right okay move by breath Sikandar both Jimmy I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's Carrie thank you very much _"

    "text": "considerable amount of work on the on the recommendations that we 're going to be considering but I 'd like to initially invite Brendan just to say a few words about the overall matter and then also that if he can take us through the recommendations as they appear in front of us now Brennan thanks Leona just like to clarify two minor points we their ears report in the first is on page 550 in the third column our voice counselors of this Evora memorandum which suggested that council has the power to change the policies like to coastal hazards we don 't believe it 's possible it 's just a minor change and also paragraph five point four the final sentence there and talking about the resource consent applications that say some other applications were withdrawn that 's not correct no applications that have been forming made have been withdrawn prior to submission decisions have been made by applicants while potential applicants not to proceed just to provide clarity on those two points [Music] what I 'd probably simply talk to is to provide additional clarity on the the steeps under section 71 over the coming period so we apologize we could have provided greater clarity in the original recommendations and effectively three steps under Section 71 process with the council a step opponent and the first step would be today and it would be to initiate the process and already started for staff to draft proposal we would come back in October seeking formal council resolution of that draft proposal and subject to the approval of Council at that point in time and we 've clarified for 23rd of October and the mean and the amended resolution up the year that would then go out to strategic partners which is under Section 66 I think in the greater Christchurch regeneration act and the name strategic partners and invite strategic partner comment on our draft proposal that has a statutory period in the act we 'll work with strategic partners and I know the media is very supportive on on this approach of trying to expedite via feedback to us so that we can move as quickly as possible through that process we 'll already started the early partners and this is occurring and we 'll work as quickly through that process with the mr. McKean and then the third step is for the council to consider the views in feedback from strategic partners and then to approve the proposal that Venus submitted to the minister and their various before December and but we what 's permitted under the Greater Christchurch regeneration act in terms of the time frame so I just played and that would be a worst-case scenario and just finally a point out that the process from the is that the minister invites public comments in the Greater Christchurch regeneration act has a shutdown period in the eighth with a days don 't count over the Christmas period from the 20th of December through to the teeth of January and the minister has time to make hue decision these are decisions beyond the council decisions the decisions of the minister and then once she 's received public comment she makes the yeast no decision on the proposal is submitted by the council so that will occur in early 2019 but I 've just stressed there the minister so it 's therefore critically important that the council proposal to the minister want to live with in its entirety and because the minister can 't change or amend it at that point in time in I think that 's a need to say at that point absolutely have you answered questions early okay I 'm just gonna check around glean because I know that this is a subject that he 's interested in as well it 's what maybe remember him but has he been seen the the changes or can he see the changes yeah but but don 't send them the ones with the crossed out because you can 't tell what 's crossed out when you send it by email cool I think that 's probably the easiest way I David fear I mean people got to have a lot of questions so David and Sarah just and Brendan required to receive submissions from he 's not a specified time period for their public submissions to date it 's kind of eerie DUP to four weeks so there would be a decision of the as it could do there is a possibility the whole thing could be wrapped up by Christmas no I don 't think it 's possible it is possible I mean if the minister no I mean it is I mean that this is the best-case scenario now the best-case scenario would have all of our strategic partners responding within the five working days it 's the best case and which is why we 're engaging form independent hearings panel members because I think that will provide comfort at every step of the process that this is that this is supported by the independent hearings panel which they viewed the actual chapter and I 've been the minister were to get it and invite a public comment and just had it open for a couple of weeks been technically speaking that could be done before Christmas on the memo number thirteen um we were saying that we 're not able to do this as part of coastal deserts chapter taking away a bit during council and allowing us control of our district planes is likely and if that wasn 't in of coastal hazards yes thank you so the wording is it stand my understanding is that the policy wording that people are after was written at a time that they 're when their residual unit overlay didn 't exist me too it was drafted for all of the H if a gym a areas so what are the implications of putting it all known that 's not correct it was it was technically written before the they made the decision yeah but the it was in the context of the residential unit eyes alone my question just to provide clarity on the process witness counsel was requested to provide a drafting service to draft this policy and that occurred and was submitted to the ISP along with associated MIPS and things there was before the decision of the ihp they introduced the residential unit overlay so the the wording of the policy as an explicit because it was not known at that time of such a thing as a resident review an overlay for part of the independent in the actual evidence that was submitted it was the it was rule they asked for the Associated criteria or assessment criteria and they asked for a policy should one be required and in terms of it not being sufficiently there so that they asked for all four at the same time so you can 't really say that I mean it 's I 'm not challenging what you 're saying from a technical point of view they were considering it in the context of the residential unit overlay that 's why they put it on as an a and lift the be a relief the existing policy is a B they may have been considered my point is that they hadn 't made the decision so it could it could apply to a broader area that is not the residential doing overlay no but no because the rule only applies to the residential unit overlay and if the extra words go into the policy that applies to a broader area of the does that mean that anything not covered by the rule that covered that creates the residential unit overlay does the is the any other area of the HF HMA opposed to a non-complying activity as a result of changing the policy current yeah the policies do but then they have to come they have been read they support the rules so the anything outside the residential unit overlay as a non complying activity so that the a non complying activity of a decision-maker on a resource consent application in the future that you 're understanding me there are two separate rules that apply in the ATF atm a one is the residential unit overlay and it 's restricted discretionary activity the rest of it all developments subdivisions even residential development that 's in other parts of the achieved HTF Oh Jim a is actually covered is non complying activity yes I think there 's simply illustrates that point that if it 's necessary to provide for clarity to look at the advice that they were provided at the time and to answer this very question because I think it will give comfort to every single step of the process afterwards if we don 't do that then I don 't know that the minister 's going to have necessarily would require and making what as a significant change to the district again for a few more okay today really really helpful I was just wondering what would change in the processes here well the only thing I wonder I want to know because I 'm worried that people think that what we 're doing is a silver bullet and I don 't think it is I always want to know what the changes will be to what happens in the process people will still have to apply for a resource consent yeah but what we will have is that the policy will support the residential unit overlay and the way that it doesn 't at the moment because it simply refers to avoid and because it 's a high-level component of the district planet that overrides the process stays the same as I understand it I think the processes remain the same but I 'll leave you to answer but my understanding is that the processes remain the same but staff will find it easier to support the application earlier on on the process when the policy doesn 't 's somewhat hypothetical but a few took the policy wording is it as it was submitted and what would require staff to under their restricted discretionary tivity to provide for development for a residential unit on a residentially zoned leand we appropriate mitigation can be provided that protects people safety well-being in property the flowcharts stay the same it would it be likely to be cheaper for anyone to get their consent flowcharts got the process for a resource consent application requirements restricted to session activities no change no change to that flowchart the nature of the assessment and some of the boxes would change but the flow is the same and people will still need to provide the same set of reports and just be able to now yes any of the 74 currently vacant sections they under these flowcharts wouldn 't be able to be built on at all like with a so but the relocatable building with a 50 year consent is there any any of those sections that wouldn 't wouldn 't stick I know I 'm just it 's just that what we 're hearing and I 'm just wondering if it 's more to do with the type of build that they 're proposing or what the fact that actually that we 've got a real like there 's actually some properties that we cannot build on and maybe we need to look at another process all those I think it 's just simply that the previous policy had a void if they 're in the so okay it would depend on what was proposed so it 's not possible to provide a blanket yes or no and what we hear what we do know is that clearly sub-divisional or profession of a second dwelling for example would remain inconsistent and one resource allocation of that nature has been declined and but this isn 't the only challenge and building in some of these locations so they would still need to meet the criteria they referred to her about mitigating life property and well-being hazards in the fall for example floor levels and the so forth would would need to be considered and as part of the proposal the reason was conceived proceeds which discretionary activity I think there 's often confusion and the public arena that restricted discretionary is more restrictive than discretionary but it 's not it 's the other way around so that it 's the discretion that 's restricted not the that short description of I mean I only say that because a lot of people don 't know and to be honest I didn 't know a lot of this before weeks ago anyway yeah one last one on coastal hazards so we get to go through the coastal hazards chapter of the district plan and the properties possible that when we do that we can go through the community engagement that were going to go through and then go through a district plan process which the above process would go through that the rules in that area could change again we would simply be speculating and I would simply observe in the next hundred years the rules around doubtedly going to change again in the council both reviews rickielee in nearly every ten years is required to fully review its district clean and so that timings of those on what the future rules could be would be a meta beyond what we know cancel all the decision-makers haven 't_''_1181.69 made any decisions about what the future coastal hazards yeah I don 't know until next year so well until after the South price on South Shore regeneration strategies works complete and fill and then yani thank you I 'm just really interested in making sure we the pathway for the consent say live in fact continues to work or works because clearly a good number like thirty-one consents have been granted it 's where I 'm coming from tone it 's clearly in the paragraph just above their five team there 's reference to many developments could be considered to increase potential risk to people safety so I just really wonder if you might given that we need a policy to clarify all this I 'm just wondering if you complex '_''_1233.37 clarified that the rules that we hear will be sufficient when we going to change the policy if it 's clarify what those rules are so that in fact there 's no really unacceptable risks the rules considering today the we 've got two key rules that we 're talking about one is non complying activity status for dwellings and the high flood hazard management hearing general the other as they rule that applies to a subset of the high flood hazard management hearing and in that subset of that subset was identified because there 's not a current risk there 's a future it 's not me right now maybe I 'll rephrase that in the future that 's why the residential unit was identified and that 's why it 's got restricted discretionary activity status for your resource consent application which is kind of a step below the non complying activity status it suggests that development and that area was more appropriate than it would be and if it 's consistent with the policy so those rules were the change to the policy will still be implementing the changed policy so the the important thing for the council to focus on is what is the what is the policy it wants to achieve for the residential unit opening area and how to phrase that light of that policy that the council 's to decide on through this process so thanks Pete so you 're really saying that that the cap the rules now would apply with a change of policy and currently they are they 're working as within the current policy given we need some change in the policy as well as as for whether that working or not the council 's considering the new policy because the council 's of the view that it 's not working and the way it was supposed to last because not all of the policy I think you 're just just very quickly just wanted to check under three whether we could just just say at the latest before additional meetings so I mean if this could come back on October 11th to the council meeting I would welcome that or if it was done sooner but I just think it would be good to have a placeholder as the last possible date for it on the 23rd yeah I mean I 'm happy for the words at the latest but you know i 'm IM IHP were the four former members of the IHP ones a a judge with obligations and the other as a as a busy planner and as the assisting queens down with it 's just to clean at the moment so you know I 'm just mindful of that but I think we will be able to write to them immediately that we 've had this decision made and get the process underway as quickly as possible Dion and gleaned after that so d on Mike and then glean I 'm sure if you can answer the question both in paragraph five point four in the paper 31 and 32 resource consent implications that proceeded to a decision have been approved some applications were withdrawn that are those applications that you know of but they because they found the process too difficult or it was I 'm just trying to get an understanding of you know the paper as it 's written seems like the issue might not be huge but the ones that have withdrawn might make it actually a bigger issue I just wanted to flesh it out a was around the there were no applications actually withdrawn but we don 't know what other application haven 't come forward so well that pulled out early on yeah exactly because people work of an advice that it wasn 't easy yeah but so I just wanted to kind of get a scope but but some of these what 's been resolved you know I 'm not you know I got an email coming and I got an email from one of the people who 's been helped through this you know who originally was one of the ones that felt that they weren 't able to they 've been able to sit down with a planner that I 've discussed the lay of the land the conversation has helped us consider future options and you know once again thank you for making it possible I mean it 's the people staff are working very hard there are some constraints because of the length of the policy you know I think people have accepted that and that 's what we 're trying to fix yes am i and then clean of them have come from the seventy-four vacant right right so that 's the issue you 've probably nailed it the others the others are simply under existing use rights is it right yeah it 's it 's a it was a really good question thank you for that I 'm clean I thank you does the status of prohibited exist at all in the entire South Shore South New Brighton area when it comes to residential builder so technically we all know but it is site specific may be situational it can be very hard to build which is what you know part of this issue is about that technically in nowhere is it actually prohibited to build there 's what you just said correct yeah okay the question is does this bring together disconnect where we have seen in some instances whereby people have a don 't consent somehow but no resource consent and so it seems a natural justice question that on the one hand counselor said you can go and do this but on the other you know we 're saying you can 't_''_1668.539 do that certainty over that this results the resource can see issue it we haven 't it 's not a building concede meter click lien might have no I know but Lynn 's going being I think to that some of the individuals who were caught up in there and in the operationalization of the decision you know like when the when the district plane sections became operational so I think they might have applied for a building consent prior to the district plan becoming operational and then told they needed a resource consent any get you know their different streams of work but they do both it may it may have been overlooked that they required a resource consent to after that so but there was a period of time because I went with heard people 's individual stories where they 've made their here okay all right so but in terms of the glossary of City is a 12-month period inhibit any way to extend the existing news products we did after the earthquakes well I 'm just reading here as you know but that 's the act as it an X we did have an extension essentially operating in a number of areas with it maybe after the egg became I mean before the district when the district plan became operational but I 'm I 'm not sure Briggs you have any light to shed on it sure so under Section 10 of the RMA that 's what sets out existing you strikes and it says existing use rights expire if the activity for which you have that right ceases for twelve months if it 's discontinued as the word used in the act so there 's been there 's never been any change to that in 12 months the pragmatic approach that the council was taking to the interpretation of section 10 the earthquake 's was that if one 's house is destroyed in an earthquake the existing use includes the ability to repair and reinstate what 's there so it 's only a few stop there reinstatement process that be 12 months kicks into play so that wasn 't a statutory change it was a pragmatic interpretation that the council talked to that provision so currently just were to rebuild similar sized house and you didn 't have you could take a pragmatic approach then they wouldn 't need a resource consent and they wouldn 't have a great deal to turn to turns on the specifics of when the previous house was removed from the site some of them were empty sites at the time of the earthquake we 're now quite a long way past the 12 months there some teams also if the section was fear when the new rule became operative it may be that is the existing replies because they didn 't write so David would you like to resolution so I 'll open it up for debate I just don 't acknowledge that you know this is following on from the notice of motion and from the concern that 's been raised by the community and the community boards and what 's come back is really that the section 71 process is the best process to find a solution it 's the most efficient even though it 's actually a little bit complicated but that 's a that 's a design city I think what 's really important here is that the 30-day notification periods the worst case scenario and I think what 's really important is that we do look to do everything in our power to expediate this process with our strategic partners and with the minister and I think there 's been a number of discussions around that in terms of this way doing it including contacting the former HP members so I endorsed this approach I think would be really useful to put a specific timetable based on the one that we 've got in here that 's generic just for this particular item just to show the community the different stages but the benefit of us retaining control rather than handing it to regenerate is the fact that we as councillors get a chance to see the wording after it goes to a strategic partners and I think that 's the point where we can really get into what is this name today is simply about initiating the process to get the drafting begun so that we can get it back to us so yeah I 's the best process in terms of a bad situation we find us then but we need to continue and move this along which is why I 'm supportive Glen did you want to contribute to the debate yes if I might just a few quick comments me basically the recommendations will become their pathway I think to expedite the whole process which links with the second part is that always that all residents have ever wanted all along is greater certainty in a very uncertain environment which we will know they 've been living in for seven years then uncertainty has picked up on 4.1 and 4.2 so I think if we can help to provide that when you consider that our home is arguably your your biggest asset if residents can know for sure yes I can make a decision I can look here technically what they want and if I can also make a plea for all 54 elected members I read recently the politics is about putting out fires rather than stoking them so if we 're in a position where we can work together to rather than hopping in and fanning the flames because the thing is all 54 you know we are part of the whole council organization I pick up sometimes you 're inclined to speak as if we 're outside it but actually were on this together and so I ask that we all work with their end in mind and you know work towards greater certainty for our residents Thanks so the purpose of this report is for the council to endorse and improve this process to resolve the uncertainty for relevance seeking to build in parts of New Brighton South New Brighton South Shore in Red Cliffs is that this uncertainty has led to a perception by residents that they cannot build and effectively in the affected areas the council has been aware of this misconception and has been progressing various solutions to address this of acidity and soot uncertainty since mid 2017 they 're our last council meeting a fellow council correctly stated that this uncertainty has lead to an unjust situation facing residents and injustice has also been suffered by council staff because of the damage done to been so maligned will take comfort that this investigation will clearly in strongly reinforce the fact that council had no ability to alter the district plan so I 'm supportive of this recommendation before us today Sarah thank you and believe it or not I 'm in favor of going through this process to look at the policy wording but I 'd like to issue a voice of caution as a nation we 're on the cusp of zero carbon legislation there 's a lot of work being done at a local and national level around the country I want to do in coastal areas see Borough Council 's councillors recently where climate change local government climate change symposium and Wellington who we heard from different areas around the country what is happening on their coasts in what they are doing to help mitigate what to allow unknown areas of Ruska due to sea level rise who pays mitigation who pays for adaption should we protect and defend or be more adaptive over time what is the insurance industry doing I don 't want to raise expectations that 's process not provide certainty for people that they are after the process and likely costs may not change we 've heard a lot from board members about the social emotional and financial costs facing these property owners but let 's turn our minds back only a few years the enormous social financial and emotional costs faced by our communities after they were read zoned in areas we counsel had allowed them to build in an appropriate manner my preference would be for us to wrap this up in the coastal hazards chapter work as like other areas around the world the rules are changing as our welders and we hear from residents time and time again that we should do things once and do them right but it seems the representatives of these residents are clear that they would like this done now even if it doesn 't provide the certainty that they would like on the time frames let 's remember that the deputations today urged us to consult with our communities to engage with them thoroughly and properly and I wouldn 't like that time cut short I 'd way that provides enough information and discussion for informed feedback for citizens around the city not just on the coast because in the future we will all face the the prospect of costs to adapt and mitigate on our coath on our coasts and we all have a vested interest in having a say so I will be voting in favor but I think we should be very cautious about the wording where it goes and any unintended consequences I see we endorse law counselor table to the sea to be our future sea level rise and climate change and how in fact it 's really important that we as a council get this right I also think that in councilor Galloway referred to some of the allegations that have been hurtful to staff the Simpson in Greece and report I think is really important and exonerate staff it says there 's no basis for the council to conclude that the omission of policy statements was a mistake or oversight and council didn 't did not sink a minor correction to include any policy amendments so I think it 's that this has been looked into I was very heartened to hear the the residence groups indicating quite clearly that they would work collaboratively with with the staff and with us as a council and with our communities their communities so I 'm certainly happy to to support the routine recommendations a deal yeah I too will support the recommendation and the issue has been coming to us for a while and I just wanted to acknowledge the the community board members up there who have actually been raising this for quite some time so I just wanted to acknowledge that they have been but we do now have a have a way forward which is which is good and and I think that will give some certainty around some of the process that we have here and acknowledging that there is some issues you know we 're facing nationally around sea level rise the potential sea level rise but the resource can seem manage the resource management and the resource consent process allows for those kind of things anyway people have to build to the conditions that that are still have to go through those processes but yeah very very keen or very happy to see a process forward and thanks to yarny for bringing the notice of motion last time or council you 're handsome and thanks to the mayor for getting this off the ground and I do hope that the I just wanted to say that moving forward with the members who have been raising this issue and I do hope that we can actually drop that stuff that 's going on maybe the the the the code of conduct stuff will potentially I just want us to all to move forward I think this is causing a divide and I think we all need to move forward thank you all right I 'm gonna leave David as the mover of the resolution with the final word but I wanted to say a few words myself I have found this issue extremely technically challenging in complex and very difficult I have immersed myself and the sequence of events that occurred that led to the writing of this particular part of the natural hazards chapter and I have a very clear understanding of the process better than some around the table but perhaps not so much as others and I stood up at a meeting and a New Brighton when I was invited to do so and I said two things one as I said that I heard very clearly from the community at that meeting that they wanted this effects first that there was the top priority fix the problem so that 's what this does it starts off down a process to fix the problem and that is absolutely an important folks and as I say I 've read the material I know the sequence of events there 's no need to traverse them here because the second thing I see it was that I was absolutely confident and the process that was followed and that there was no evidence to support allegations that had been made but I also understood very clearly from the meeting itself that that wasn 't going to be good enough for anyone and that meeting the fact that I was satisfied after doing that research is neither here nor so that it is crystal clear and the reason that we 're doing it is to provide confidence confidence is the most important word that has been expressed around this table today and I think it is absolutely vital that we earn back the confidence from our communities and that we work collaboratively with our community boards to ensure that their confidence is well placed so I 'm I said at that meeting too that the section 71 process be careful what you wish for that is not a quick process it wasn 't designed for this purpose it was designed because we are the only council in the entire country that doesn 't have access to the RMA to change our district plan so but I tragically and my search for a faster process say the reestablishment of the IHP the advice came back that it 's not possible so I want us to control this all the decision-making comes to this table we 're the ones who decide the word and we 're the ones who put it out to the strategic partners we 're the ones who that I think has been misunderstood is that from the minute it goes to the minister despite the public consultation and input that she will seek by law there is nothing she can do other than say yes or no she can 't change a single route it 's another reason why I don 't actually like the process so much because sometimes it 's in their iterative process that you come up with the right wording so we have to make sure that the wording that goes in front of the minister is the wording that will solve the problem I 'm thinking firstly kid I just complement the mayor for the very clear and easily understood interpretation of section 71 I 'd also like to acknowledge Brendon Anstis for a very clear and responsive memo around the issues that we 're dealing with today I can 't emphasize enough I think the importance of having the some of the IHP members confirm the policy I think that is the probably the most strategic step of the the whole exercise secondly we 've spoken at depth today around the see this process dealt with quickly efficiently and in a timely manner and whilst we 've heard that some of the processes could lead to a worst case scenario that it could drag on after Christmas I firmly believe that if we give the right emphasis talk to the people and get the right answers there is a distinct possibility that we can wrap this up very quickly and certainly it would be a great Christmas prison for people of the south New Brighton South Shore and reakless area I think it 's very important that we give relief to the citizens of South New Brighton South Shore and reakless they 've struggled for some time and we 've heard also of the psychosocial and financial pressures that some of them are being under I would like to also acknowledge that there have been a number of consents that have been processed and I like to particularly acknowledge the staff that have managed to work through some of these issues with with residents to get a number of consents over the mark and one in particular is Nathan O 'Connell of our residents down there it 's plainly obvious that I 've been involved in this process for several weeks now but I 'd like to just finally say that I am committed to participating in a collaborative process involving the City Council our strategic partners DPM C Minister wood and importantly the community involved to get a quick and meaningful outcome for all concerned thank you thank you I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much thank you _"

    "text": "right I will get started on the citizens war memorial I think there 'll be a number of questions that people will have and but will adjourn for morning tea probably in about 10 minutes or so thank you very much so I don 't know whether you want to begin with a bit of a presentation there 's a lot of attachments which you 've all got I guess the key points here in listening to other discussions it 's in also remembering that back quite some time ago presentation to council and so I mean I guess the issue here is that the City Council are the guardians of the citizens war memorial custodian think it was my question wasn 't it the ownership so my reading of all of the documents that we 've been provided as that we are the custodian for maintenance essentially but that the the once the trust was wound up essentially the memorial became part of the cathedral precinct as the reading and the document but it didn 't say that the ownership transferred to us or that guardianship does which has resolution that was passed by council asked William years ago I don 't think you were on it leave the key Edie no that 's not even gonna get a laugh you know so I 'm just I mean that 's that 's sort of my question really is that I don 't know that we can legally make this decision will breed might be the one to answer us absent a direction from the cpt I agree with you me at the the owner of the between the parties the council says caretaker an actual fact though all the parties treat it as the property easy piece of paperwork to transfer the ownership for me yeah yeah but we 've never made that as a decision of the council I mean it 's just it it I mean this really didn 't occur to me until we were getting representations from the Heritage groups and and I started to ask myself the question because the question I 've always asked well if the cpt directed us to move it we would be legally obliged to but actually would we money that was held on trust that was transferred at the time which we drew down on for maintenance for a period of time and I presume that that 's now exhausted but I haven 't had a specific I don 't we know that it was closed down but there was I think actually it seems quite a ridiculous amount but the so did the amount they fundraise you know ten thousand pounds I wish that 's all it cost now but the the I think it was something like 500 pounds and but that was for the purposes of moving it if it needed to be moved as well as providing for its maintenance so I mean it was it was it was almost like it was a assurity you know that was provided in advance of something perhaps happening that required it to be moved you you correct them in the they 've quite adequately covered themselves by other clauses in the deed saying no expense of any kind shall fall upon the chapter or the church probably trustees in connection with the memorial at any time the memorial shall be removed without expense to the chapter so the deed was very carefully yes that 's we are custodians Council resolution beckon no there 's gonna be lots of questions so so we 're just yeah who 's all got questions now I 'll go around the table cause it 's yeah so if we start with some term and thank you I 've got another questions the first one is what would happen if we turn around to actually know if the church properly trust want it shifted did they instruct us to what would why don 't we do there because we 've already put right powers ten million dollars of rate payers money into the cathedral and let 's be honest the the the cost of perhaps shifting it will be the same between one point five and two million which will fall on the right part of Christ no no no no that was that 's not going to come in at the near so you know the government 's providing channels for that it 's in the paper yeah in in the you tried to pick up the whole mound shift it 's the most expensive one that made the headline staff recommendations under 2.1 in fact it just seems that all this is aiming at shifting so for instance 2.1 council agrees to seek the community 's views on and n determines which of the three alternative sites proposed lead mr squared crema or elsewhere in cathedral square so technically there 's not a fourth one but it 's saying keep it where it is under under the first recommendation yep that 's where it 's asking you so if you say no you have been item 2 item 2 disappears we don 't go out to concert so if the church property trust want it shifted then they can instruct us in do we look at this yes you could do that with whether or not the I mean there is an option for government funding at this stage but green brink can we legally make a decision to move something we don 't own property trustees saying that the the structure is going to impede be a work on we instruct you to move it yeah but if it but if it did go that step further then we wouldn 't have a choice but as a and and we wouldn 't be liable for it well just going back to the step there 's the discussion we were having this make us you know sort of does this actually make us an owner by default if we actually accede to a request when it 's made the course of conduct between the parties so for the years has been through the council being the owner yes formally at law the memorial as a result of the deed the council 's activity of the memorial because of the care okay so so perhaps the request to move it should have been directed to the cpt if not instead of at least as well as counsel the cpt has a number of times yeah okay well I 'm just questioning whether it 's sufficient last year Nitin yes constructing the reconstruction company through the cpt with regards to protecting them taken all reasonable steps to protect the historic place site site is not unusual correct so there 's therefore the Alita to us as merely a request which we can actually look at we do not have to and we 're not obligated to take up Aaron not at the bridge remembrance which is the War Memorial do we know some recent even even prior to some recent prior to we can direct their I mean we can 't directly today but we can find out the answer to that Phil thank you and my questions around the costs if the memorial stays where it is because the problem trustees and the later they indicate that there will be higher costs or costs will increase can they or anyone give us any estimate of the cost of it staying with us in terms of the the costs for the history of evil restoration no they haven 't cost of that out I know that Lynn 's earlier on it 's similar wall type protection that goes around the rest of the precinct the the type of protection you will need because it 's such a structure I guess they 're so um I 've skipped over the absent year by excellent I just didn 't notice them put his hand up so Flynn Livingston would you like to ask your question now okay this will come from that Thank You Leanne sorry just have one of two technologies thanks break for the obviously for the report I guess my question is why the Senate are given them we knew for instance look at a top-down view of the whole site and that the rationale for this excess for restoration you know you can ask the same question for instance subsided Visitor Center or the trees or constraints of the road so have you heard any other or are you aware of any other requests to potentially move anything else in order to in order to be thick restoration no I haven 't had any other requests there 's Oh the only other work that 's really been down is I guess the the regeneration plan for Cathedral Square many of the items stay on that but no I haven 't heard any other thank you yeah okay I had one owns it so how can the church then all the church property trusts demand us to move it so you know a lot of the pretense has been that they 're going to instruct us to move it because it 's needs to be moved potentially from their point of view but actually we don 't own it as you 've just said the deed they own it so that 's an interesting one doesn 't it big because they yes they are the owner of it but the course of dealing between the parties I was describing before and the council performs the duties of the land of the owner of the memorial the council looks after the council 's maintains the council puts that so money into doing that the community treats it as being a council I mean this is another perception and reality issue but I mean it black and white they technically can 't demand her demand the council move it can they correct okay Pauline I 'm struggling to understand actually we don 't and currently and in this report the costs the costs council it 's been funded through other means so so the the costs and the report that are indicated it also sees the the costs aren 't on council so in terms of making their decision you you 're not you know you 're not putting council in the position where they might be an open-ended process for example but it 's a sit before the the cost of protection can 't really be done until you know what the terms of and Andrew thank you and I got a couple of questions really just seeking clarification so 55.63 of the report talks about funding been available from other agencies and this has been referred to a couple of times and answers to questions already the confidence that we of this there are counseled will not intend have will not be left funding this from rates I mean to say that we expect fundings available to say that we expect other agencies will cover the cost of it that 's great that 's an expectation but is there a scenario that could roll out from here where we make the decision and other funding doesn 't end up covering the whole cost we end up wearing some of it the if the council decides that it should be shifted the the lead agency in terms of the shift would be limbs so the funding that we made it very clear right from the start that any council funding we do have some funding for these citizens war memorial but that is for restoration and earthquake repairs only and that 's for that would be for looking after the especially the bronzes and bits and pieces so we made we 've made it very clear that there is no council funding or potential for council funding for any of this yep so if we would have passed these resolutions today if we were that 's on the basis that we have no funding available other than that which is already there for maintenance for this project it 's correct okay coming back to the legalities of the agreement and bearing in mind that the agreement was between the church property trustees and the Christchurch War Memorial which now no longer exists one party to it is is not valid it 's essentially from what we 've heard this morning an agreement between the church property trustees and the owner of the memorial so it 's essentially a set of principles between the church and itself yes I think just clarify so from my reading that era say the church heritage in New Zealand you 're attached here it is New Zealand the church the church properties people are all supportive of it being moved correct so given that level of interest would the history be an indication that people have also prepared to fund in some ways it been discussed there 's there 's another there has been discussions around funding and even as part I think I saw a statement the other day from RSA about trying to access the fund that was set up for the hundred year celebration as well so there 's there 's opportunities there that have been talked about but it 's all through other agencies not through Council thank you and I think it 's actually important that way I guess establish the actual guess my questions more around whether we can put in the consultation about actually leaving it in its current position instead of making the decision now to move it actually consult on whether we should leave it where it is move it there that creates the dilemma of going into resulting as to whether to shift to the not aim Dean still having church property trustees come back and say shift it anyway so you 've just then you 're in a position where you 've yes and where everything should sit great and then deal oh sorry Ciara sorry I thought I asked people to put up their hands if they want to no I see no go round the table and order what people put anyway be done because I 'm not sure whether we 're moving is because the IRA Singh wants it moved to a new site that 's where they wanted in Cranham Square or is the worry that it might get damaged I don 't really see that you shouldn 't be able to protect something like that it 's by the way it process I think I think it worried I think that from the reading of the papers and in particular the heritage museums statement and support was the was the concern about about whether it could be sufficiently protected is it am i and also to the question if you go back to the era say his original deputation to Council they also they talked about it wasn 't just about protecting it from damage it was also giving it its own sense of place and having more room for celebrations and volume as well so all of those reasons are also in the church property trustees letter which is also attached it 's not just about the risk in the interpretation to it in the damage it 's also about it 's about the land wanting to use their land as well so there 's a number of issues there it 's not just about its in risk of of damage but yeah anyways Sarah and then Dionne thinks just quickly if we decide not to do this now and we don 't go through the whole do we move we 're and which leaves us open to horrible public perception shall we should we be then asked to me but if we don 't do this now and we wait till we are directed so then we consult on we once we direct it then we consult on where we move it to because we 've been directors or whether we remove it hold it and storage and reinstate on-site once the reinstatement of the cathedral is yeah I guess there 's a couple of risks there first one is a few removed it held it and then wanted to put it back the church property trustees may not graduate but mission to put it back but there would be part about a nice process it would be part of the whole discussion that we 'd have if we chose to consult and we talk to the future Property Trust it was an option it 's correct and the only other risk is that any funding that may have been put aside by other agencies may not be there at the time that would be the only risk that little bit here cuz I don 't think we can actually make a decision we don 't either we technically don 't own it so we can 't_''_1479.12 be instructed to move it either technically so I mean I think we actually need to go and probably lay this on the table and actually go back to the Trust property trustees and actually actually have a conversation with them also asking to we think about the clarity of the funding available for the protection of it because if this funding available to move it those same funders might be actually came to the question to staff or are you questioning me no I mean I just actually said to the chief executive we may have to leave this lie on the table for the simple reason that we we probably need a decision made about the ownership and there is a there is a very specific issue which is around the ownership for them which is why I 'm totally against the idea of consulting on whether to move it or not because you do that and we get to then we 're directed to move it I mean it 's just there would be no credibility in the process whatsoever just because we don 't have the say at the end of the day if they if we 're director well yeah and it may well be but I mean isn 't it better to have a proper discussion about legal ownership yes I mean this was a mission we appeared all the submissions this was initiated by a citizen 's community group that was established for this purpose the location was a specific part of what they were doing and the other thing was that both the City Council and the area say opposed it both them so you know it 's we talk about ourselves as kind of you know representatives in this regard but but perhaps it might be better to find another way of actually ensuring the future status of us in may well be that the the yeah I don 't want to get to a situation where the true owners make a direction ahead of who would you direct it to if you it 's kind of anything goes about zero so I would think that being that we 've been very clear that we don 't know enough about the ownership if we went ahead today and did make a decision to consult to move out it 's been very clear in the past that heritage is because I 'm pretty passionate about what goes on in the square and have taken legal action in the past and this would be a basis for some legal action to stop it happening there 's always the possibility of there being legal action to to review a council decision judicial review in the High Court but just picking up on one of your comments counselor that is uncertainty over ownership with I think that 's relatively clear from the deeds there the parties now where we 've been talking about the risk of there being a direction from the church property trustees to the council to move it and whether it 's possible to make a direction to the council to move something that the council doesn 't actually own now the legal situation owner but if the council was to be asked to move it because as that risk of being damaged in the cathedral repair and the council sees now I 'm not going to move but it 's not your problem I wonder whether that 's a perfect position for the council to be and to disclaim responsibility or Kia yes in desert a custodian role you know so in the role of custodian could we be asked to move it yeah and could be legally considered that in our role as custodian people was sort of warming to this you know this was an important set of documents to bring together and this is an important part of a very public conversation that we need to have as a city you know and and you know I mean I know everyone dots their eyes and crosses their T 's and a fearful of people diving off to court and you know getting injunctions and left right and center we have two pieces of legislation that cover this particular part of our city at the moment one is specifically for the and the other one for the for the Greater Christchurch regeneration and either or both of those as the paper says could be employed to provide some support for decisions being made they will be subject to public consultation but not to appeals other then on points of law so it 's a it 's a bit submits the process matter but I think that the RSA brought this to us I think they brought it to the church property trustees as well we 've spoken to the church property trustees we 've asked them for a direction they haven 't quite come over the line this was the strongest Lisa that we received from them and even with a direction I think that the the question of ownership needs to be a public conversation so I am of the view to leave this metal eye on the table for some additional room but but in so doing I don 't_''_1870.25 I want to thank everyone that 's put so much hard work into the documentation and I 've I 've struggled with with the ownership issue at the end that as a as a custodian and the thing is that is the most precious precious of things and it is so sad that the council of the day was you know so unsupportive and I 'm sure the RSA members today feel the same about the RSA at the time being unsupportive of what is the most magnificent Cenotaph that was designed for its location so you know it 's but I think that to have a public education about what the the statuses we 're in a position to do that but until we receive a direction from the church property trustees I don 't know that it 's a matter that we need to we should even consider and the the other thing is is that I wonder whether in the meantime we should talk about whether it 's with with a central government can use its current powers or order to give certainty to the outcome because the last thing that you 'd want to do is to make them decision to move something temporarily and then not be allowed to put it back so so Miri who I know leads the team that 's done all this hard work on this matter and no I know but I 'm sort of but I don 't want to sort of say will this be disappointing to you breed Bert I 've got plenty of other work to do I guess I guess we do need some sort of clear direction as to what you want us to do you want us to go away and and clarify that whole ownership custodial responsibilities come back to you oh I 'm just wondering whether it needs a sort of almost a tripartite conversation with yourselves well more than tripartite the RSA the Heritage groups and potentially the cpt I mean all of those groups have been involved in meetings it 's something that certainly from the discussion today certainly needs to be clarified so that council know knows whether it can make a decision and and it 's almost like what 's the what what is the alternative because I almost don 't want us to get into a brinksmanship situation either because you know it 's it I think we want the general public to understand the issues and often and these you know the this sort of that the times of the ten second sound bite and you know that you know cut bait approach to coverage on social media it 's it 's hard to express just how precious this item is and its history and what it means and how it got to where it 's got to and what the decision might mean either which way but I do think we need to have some bitter advice from CPT or even the group that 's been set up with the government about the reinstatement and what the costs and the risks to their actual Memorial hour because I almost can 't believe that they didn 't consider that when they were considering the the reinstatement question because they knew that it was their used so so perhaps a little bit more diving into that area and we 'll see what we can do in terms of the yeah Pauline did you have another question it may be the right thing to do but advice that we need to come back to as you know that sorting out the ownership issue in a way that actually gives security around its location because you you you you you can 't have an owner of such a precious piece of our heritage you know in a way that you can 't have control over it 's staying where it is I mean II can 't_''_2204.53 I mean it 's just not right so so maybe this is the opportunity to sort something yeah and that 's the dilemma that because the the original Association no longer exists you have a trustee that 's an owner but in the same document saying but if we want you to get it off our land you 've got to get it off our land but now he has no one to direct that to other than asses the custodian so it 's just all being discussed on the working party no it was based on some earlier conversations around council being the custodian and then being the landowner was I guess assumed assumed yeah there 's no criticism or an interesting piece of our history and I 'm really glad that people are getting to understand it in this way but I think we should leave this lie on the table and I 'm just wondering how long you 've got some wording there so some wording for resolution is that the council lead the report to lie on the table into a future meeting to enable additional additional information and advice to be provided so I 'm prepared to move there do I have a seconder Mike Davidson so I will put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried here 's a note end in Galloway so look _"

    "text": "we 'll move on to public participation and beginning what the public forum could I invite Ross Holland come forward good morning my address is very short it 's just to do with the living that we 've been imposed for the rebuild of the cathedral and whilst it 's only small at 7 50 it is in another levy on their rates which are causing concern to us ratepayers that they just continually coming out my particular brief is here is that the council by approving them have made a bit of a decision to represent one Church and if you can do that why is the levy not maybe being added to my background and what particularly gets me here is that I accept that the cathedral is in the historic and trust and therefore it has to be predictable but I would have thought it was mandatory for anyone who 's got a historic they should be fully insured because insurance is for now we have already has great pays suffered with the fact that under the previous mr. Merrit the council changed insurance obviously worked on one time not realizing this and we were mystically underinsured across and we 're paying for that already the likes of mr. Arnott and in that continually took this procedure of rebuilding the Cathedral to court that put that money into paying the full insurance replacement on there wouldn 't be fallen on a storybook and I did a small survey I was got a daughter and another friend who are both teachers at high school and I got the issue most people didn 't even realize I appreciate reality but this isn 't just think that a dangerous precedent has been because they are underinsured and making us will pay for what the living is only to be for 10 years I 've guaranteed the end of the team is there a explain the jinx it will be absorbed so I just believe it as the council obviously it 's more survey done I think most people are quite ignorant about their piddly it 's small but it still is another levy that we 've been living the Cathedral and so those are my concerns thank you very much people to come along and have this say and really appreciate you having done so I 'd like to offer to follow up with some providing you with some information about the process that we went through it 's not going to change anything and I understand that your your your position as the waiters I like the fact that we 're account saw where people can come along and and help you say and we really appreciate the fact that you 've done so today thank you Michael Bell [Music] thanks for having me just I want to chat about just a couple of things today so so I planned for awhile to come and brief everyone on the Big Ben festival which we are now in the 12th year of so we have big bands come from around the South Island every year sometimes from the North Island basically activating the city over Labor weekend something like 60 something individual performances happening around the city so you got a new regent street the art gallery little high you 'll find Big Ben 's everywhere so about 15 to going to be performing around the city and I 'd really just really want encourage everyone to get out and and check it out there is a website here so you can quite easily anyway oh yeah how to use this so you can so you can you can go around and see things in the streets there are dances and the evenings there are gala concerts we 've got Steve gage it was pretty much the number one drummer in the world is coming to Christchurch to perform this labor weekend and the other thing I would plead with you is please don 't go on holiday on Labor weekends to come down because as well as the Big Bend first of all is Pfister which is going to be and Spanish and Latino week it 's gonna be it 's gonna be a really really exciting time so so make sure you yeah you check it out now just very smoothly see growing thank you very smooth least agreeing and we were about two and a half months ago trying to I guess solve the age-old question of our gala concert and we basically started looking at this idea of well what if we put up a festival tent to use as a as a hub and I was like well I think I know a few other dozen people that would be keen to get involved and this and this pop-up venue so I made some phone calls and before well within about a month we had about 75 bookings for this theoretical venue so I just continued to look down this track and want to actually think we council the places project fund who have put forward 15,000 and to this into this project and looks like we 're gonna be open one week today so please come down and check it out touchwood yeah well so this is going to be on on the site of the future Performing Arts precinct so the corner of Colombo Street and Gloucester streets so

today thank you right now we move on to deputations by appointment and could we start with item 28 the Historic Places Canterbury Marc Girard welcome my apologies counselors the internet last night but this deputations a compliment oh just Thank You Marion counselors for gardening start places Kennedy the quest to make the step you take this deputation made reference to the draft heritage strategy item 28 on today 's council meeting agenda HPC is aware that it has proposed the drive strategy be put out for consultation and my panel hearing and this deputation can finds itself to the process of the engagement used HPC commends the councillors for adopting the process of engagement where the community and individuals drove the formulation of the draft heritage strategy HPC also commends the Christchurch heritage team who with professionalism and vigor almost bordering on enthusiasm engage the community it is the chairs opinion that there cannot be many individuals or community groups who missed out on the council here it to formally thank you to you the council 's who approved the engagement that effectively allowed the hedged team to go out to the community and asked what they wanted in their huge strategy as HBC chair I would like to record my appreciation for the leadership shown by the council 's who participated in the engagement as chair I heard the mayor councillors clear wood on Galloway participate in workshops and councillors Livingston and Johansen attended the community report back for those councillors who attended the engagement events and I have admitted to mention please accept my apologies my excuse of the engagement was so extensive it was difficult to keep up of who attended we 're so thank you for your leadership signalling a start places care can it be requested the councillors pass on to the heritage team our appreciation of the design of the engagement process in its execution that led up to this draft here it is strategy their efforts we should note were recognized with a commendation that this year 's cannot be here two draws and I should notice the mayor will testify are two snapshots that I 'd like to share with that sort of summed up the hairdos team 's approach the hairdos team social commentary development and Housing Committee report on what I would call the research phase with a reporter back on what they 'd found had some really interesting things I consider reporters contents to be a very good one and as you all well be aware I Lobby quite hard at the coffee break for its findings to be reported back to the community and the team was so immersed in the process of what that they may not have been aware of the interest in the contents reports which is a compliment to the CEO that they were so locked and where they were going and what they were doing except on the process where they were going that an idea that we changed tack slightly and go back to the community then but the upshot was later that day I got a phone call later and quite late in the day saying seeking more informal feedback on an outline from proposed community report back so their processes neighbors decide safe to say they got a positive report reports back report back on to the what the findings though they 'd found on the other one i point out which is great quote at the draft strategy workshop where a number of the stakeholders were in a room with coffee as we reported went through the draft and what 's proposed on the strategy one participant observed to me you open your mouth and for council staff start taking notes followed by the hugest team we 're open practical flexible and very early stake our involvement occurs will lead to a solution that is more acceptable and effective HPC considers this should be the council template should be the norm thank you very much pinky well I have to say that it 's um it is incredibly gratifying to hear a submission like that I was one of the ones that attended one of the one of the sessions and I think the staff were up sort of probably slightly horrified that I did that but it was such an amazing process and I just I of the report base from each of the tables you know you could sort of feel the sort of blending of views that had come together in such a wonderful way so I do hope that it 's a template and I 'm glad that all counselors have got to hear that because it 's an ideal process for engaging people who are already engaged in an issue and then occasionally attracting and others who sort of come along for the ride and get swept up on it so I felt exactly the same way so I 'm I 'm absolutely thrilled to hear that but I don 't know does anyone have any questions for mark is a formal deputation oh well thank you very much and congratulations to staff too because that that took a lot of courage I think to go out in a new way and engage the community so thank you very much so and the next is the Inner City we snabel hood association and restore christchurch cathedral and i think they 're coming together Neil Roberts representing the unassessed in a City West on item 29 citizens war memorial request for relocation and there 's a paper coming around the table welcome thank you counselors for receiving this deputation I 'm here on behalf of icon the inner city West Neighborhood Association item 29 on your agenda of courses the speed has been stated as the removal of the citizens War Memorial and relocation somewhere else on the city this this suggestion we believe that it compromises not only the values of the memorial but it will likely have the potential to compromise other sites in the city where the weather memorial may be located we don 't know where that is yet but that 's potentially it could be the case we also believe that there are certain acts of good faith that needs to be observed in terms of this memorial and the first that I would indicate is the good faith whether the originator of this Memorial mr. George Gould it wouldn 't be there if it wasn 't_''_1100.33 for God he campaigned through the 1920s vigorously to have this memorial built against considerable opposition from the RSA and as project and have it have all the money which is ten thousand pounds at that time turned over for welfare purposes they said we don 't need another Memorial in the city we 've got the bridge of remembrance that 's all it is necessary fortunately he prevailed and the one thing that 's very important with George Gould and the memorial is that he insisted that that memorial needed to be in the heart of the city nowhere else and the heart of the city is Cathedral Square that 's where he intended it to go and that 's where it should remain to delete to move it out of there is to lose faith with that regional intent now you can say well God 's been dead since 1941 doesn 't matter the next faith that should be good faith that should be observed is with the designers most people don 't realize that that is a site-specific memorial it 's designed to be in an inner-city location it 's designed to be in a closed environment not an open environment it would look totally different if it it belongs in a situation where there are buildings around it not an open space if you put it in an open space it look totally different and even you need to recognize what Truffaut II and his collaborator the architect George Hart intended when they designed their to not observe that is to deny their their purpose with this memorial it 's not a piece of furniture that can you can remove and move from room to room around the city it 's it 's not like there and the third act of good faith that should be observed is in relation to the Akuma 's Charter which the Christchurch City Council is a signatory to and is adopted and the Charter states that the site of a structure is an integral part of its cultural heritage value you can move it but under one the site is not of associated value to relocation is only means of saving the structure well neither of those apply in this particular instance so I think that if the City Council is to observe the very Charter that it is aligned itself of this memorial it stood there for over 81 years now and it should remain there for another 81 years so other generations can get the benefit of it so I can 't request that the memorial stays where it is did you want to speak as well so sorry did you did you want did you did you want to speak as well yes yes I 'm David Collins a committee member of the historic rise to H Cathedral group the first three paragraphs are explaining the background of the group but to think you 're familiar with now I 'll just read the rest of it one take a moment and the Cenotaph memorial to the tragedies of war was purposefully erected beside the cathedral its design reflecting Christian symbolism was it was stipulated by and conscious leadership at that time that the condition of it being located on Cathedral land the Cenotaph also has a special place in the history of spiritual memory of our city which became an extra clearly linked to the Cathedral and Christian values and to Antioch those services for the purposes of to a city to the people and it 's legal ownership as with our City Council it does not belong to the IRSA the COR was a privately funded citizens project the project which the RSA did not contribute to financially and actually opposed for some time once completed in 1937 the Cinna staff became the setting for the seasons at a memorial services led by the RSA and typically concluded by a service and the Cathedral thus the histories of the senator from the Cathedral have been inextricably linked since the mid 1930s our strong belief is that the kathy the sinister half should remain in its current position beside the Cathedral but Cathedral and since I would be diminished if separated they belong together there 's places of memory for all people in our cities central cathedral square a sitting which with the recovery of the cathedral in the square will again and see busy throngs of citizens and visitors the cathedral precinct will become the foremost place to visit and gather in our city an entirely different scenario from the comparatively isolated kremlin square dimensioned possible alternatives a direct consequence of decisions of the former bishop and the church property trusts she chaired their planes from new cathedral annex buildings required the sinister heart to be moved the removed the RSA were given notice of this intent condition exists the Cenotaph was blocked by fences on the pretext it was done unsafe there 's no basis for how Uranus UNICEF must be shifted to enable restoration it can be predicted Institute and worked around the tram tracks and roadway are much closer to the Cathedral then the Cenotaph we believe the vision of recovering the cathedral to its former glory by association requires a Cenotaph to be likewise honored and retained beside the cathedral there have been too many losses and too much change as a consequence of the quakes now is the time to value and protect what remains about cities special places it 's time to recover after these special places of memory and protect them into the future thank you ok questions of Pauling any other questions I 'm Phil thank you deputation your comment is that it should stay exactly where it is the the other concern is that if it stays exactly or it is that in fact with the best protection it could still be damaged and as one even might make a comment about their risk yes I understand that you do it very substantially I 've often written conditions and resource consents that require things to be protected had one instance I can call you know it 's a cottage and Queenstown got damaged but generally they are respected and in this case it 's a substantial structure and you 'd have a substantial structure around that to protect it I 'm totally confident it can be protected Dion just on the off chance that the church property trusts require the council to remove its the citizens memorial what would you believe or from both of you what would you believe would be the best alternatives location in that situation comment on location that 's I mean it would be the subject of a consultation if we decide to yeah who owns the war memorial we 've hit a resolution that says that the City Engineer be appointed custodian the memorial be maintained to an adequate standard with reimbursement of funds from the trust fund of necessary trust fund which I understand is exhausted do we really own it I mean the land is owned by the church properly trustees and we 'd be required to move it if they asked us to it 's in the paperwork attachment I mean I 've found this all very interesting I assumed that there would be a you know that somewhere I would find a specific document legal document that said that we were the owner of the memorial but it does appear that we 've become the custodian on the the what was the there was a there was a group that was the citizens group you know that had been originally established they were the ones that maintained the maintained it sorry they had a they had an agreement at the agreements sitting here it 's dated they can nineteen something or other with the actual with the church properly trustees the trust deed sorry it just seems to me that this was this this may be the core Memorial Association incorporated so there was a or maybe only but I just thought that you may have done some consideration of the ownership pushing alright so thank you very much for your deputation thank you and the next submission is the Christchurch Civic Trust and Historic Places Trust Osprey representing both thank you welcome Thank You media and good morning and good morning to city councillors I 'm here here well this deputation to represent the the very strongly held view of the crisis if ik trust and Historic Places Canterbury of which I am the Deputy Chair or both and we strongly oppose the removal of the citizens warm oil from vigil sweetie so I 'm going to read from my paper which I believe you have on your screens if not there 's some paper copies around the citizens war memorial monument is a vital and integral component of the city 's most important public space I think as we all accept Cathedral Square and it is essential that it remains so in the post-disaster years it 's structural and visual form creates a carefully orchestrated synergy needs the cathedral and the cathedral needs it because of a shared meaning embodied in the crucifix form of both structures and if you think of the play at the floor plan of the Cathedral obviously it 's a cross a Latin cross transept and so on and the memorial itself is across obviously vertically in elevation and in physical form in stone and so on 15 meters higher in fact this is no accident or coincidence the end of intuitive explicit instruction on these design matters and sculpture William truth fury an architect George hat of the miller 's building claim in case you in doing so they created what in new zealand historian jock phillips says is possibly the finest public monument in the country to separate the two structures would be considerably diminished both heritage structures restated for more than half its life christchurch cathedral has been the core of a shared civic experience of great profundity with its nearest neighbor the citizens War Memorial the Civic Trust of historic places Canterbury cannot see any valid reason whatsoever to sever this physical and deeply symbolic bond the contribute a generous 10 million dollars to the reinstatement of Christchurch Cathedral although I know there 's still some opposition to that with some stated restrictions which most people aren 't aware of but you people will know this follows a long history of the Council of the council making a significant contribution to the Cathedral including reroofing and youthquake strengthening without which of course the the the quake the Cathedral would could well have collapsed entirely in the quakes furthermore the current concept plan by regenerate Christchurch for the future of Cathedral Square show the citizens will more well war memorial in its present position planners have not have clearly not considered its presence a problem rather I think they see it as part of the mix of features contributing towards a vibrant Civic Centre and you all very small for you to see but you will recall the regenerate document the square and there we see very nicely surrounded by paving and trees and so on the citizens were more warm oil and you can get some sense of the the real distance it is from the building objection that by many I guess that the cathedral of some years away from reoccupation may be true but in the interim of the south-facing areas of the wonderful new city library surely offer quiet spaces with views out to the War Memorial in light of these factors that would be highly productive for the council to accede to the rep the RSA 's request to move the memorial away from Cathedral Square to another city location it would be endangering in fact I maintain we maintain the integrity of the cathedral itself which you 're giving 10 million dollars of rate payers money towards thankfully and it would also impact on the half share of the 9.75 or whatever it was contribution you 're making to the regeneration of the square as a base starting point figure the RSA submission takes little account of the war memorials function to be a reminder and a memorial of war and sacrifice for everyone certainly not just for the comrades family members or descendants of Association members for instance thousands of German sorry for instance some thousands of German and Japanese tourists some who will have fought against New Zealanders most unlike most unlikely to make a special trip to another open space I won 't mention any names to visit the citizens War Memorial relocated there in fact because Christchurch Cathedral is so close to the war memorial visitors to it are provided with a a ready-made handy magnificent enclosed space whose purpose well its secondary purpose if you like powerful worship is to give people of any and all persuasions a place in which to reflect the citizens woman whirlwind viewed from east of the square and this was mentioned by Neil represents a relatively plain rear facade as will be aware this is not a significant problem given the extent of the surrounding built environment but if it were to be shifted to another open city space or to an open city space this would present a serious visual difficulty giving the possibly long vistas from any direction and as Neil mentioned the memorial is absolutely a site-specific Monument nothing nothing other then if it weren 't for the church for the Anglican Cathedral in its requirements that Cenotaph it 's absolutely a part of the of that space if you like this is sorry the the christchurch Indosat is totally unsuitable for shifting away from its designated site the christchurch Civic Trust has a particular concern for urban planning matters and is alarmed at the ramifications for inner city living neighbourhood living the any shift would raise such matters as sighting orientation impact on living values and the life it appears to have been all too easy for the RSA and I mean that and not an unkindly Manor to claim some sort of ownership for citizens war memorial it commemorates the ultimate sacrifice made by men and women from Canterbury but those who remember are in fact all people from from Greater Christchurch Canterbury New Zealand in fact the globe the memorial is owned by the citizens of Christchurch and as n is administered and cared for by the funds from those ratepayers the RSA 's line of thinking that the War Memorial must be shifted in its request may well be born of years of post earthquakes frustration one can understand there but it carries I attitude and it fails to take into account all relevant heritage and even planning factors professor Chris Kisling who is the chair of the Civic Trust couldn 't be here today so I would like to conclude with a brief comment from him okay quote the submission certainly represents my personal view regarding the War Memorial staying where it is I do not believe the restoration work on the cathedral requires the shift of the War Memorial and I have not seen any cogent arguments for such an undertaking the citizens warm oil is not at his peace to be moved from square to square at the whim of current players who have decision-making power finally the crisis if we trust in Historic Places can 't_''_2320.65 be thank you for this opportunity we both urge you as mayor and councillors to reject the request by the RSA for the removal of the citizens warm of oil from the heart of the city Cathedral Square thank you thank you questions one of the other concerns that their church property trusts have told us about is that in fact if it remains restoration could rise does that not consider you well well in the city we know that anything could happen but things don 't have to happen and there was nothing there was certainly nothing in the as I recall it and the Cathedral working group report the one that sealed the deal that it was going to be reinstated as to the detrimental effects on the budget with any consideration of the reinstatement in relation to the Royal so I certainly wouldn 't take that at face value counselor and I think that would need very much more substantial baking by the cpt felt just briefly thank you thanks Ross you 've used the phrase anything that can happen could happen it 's just are you not concerned that in fact you know there is clearly a risk if it if it 's even with the best protection and that in fact if it was it was broken but with heavy machinery or whatever then effect one it would be gone forever oh well I don 't think they would necessary photo counselor I think if it were if it earthquake things get repaired but I certainly support David Collins 's view there that that sufficient protection could be provided on this amazingly high tech city of ours that it seems incomprehensible but it couldn 't be pretended sufficiently for it to maintain its place goes on does the trust acknowledge that if we were required by the cpt to move it we would be required to do so and would have to well we haven 't_''_2458.0 we haven 't covered that [Music] but obviously that 's something that would it would need to be considered but my point in drawing attention to what what the City Council you people and we have contributed to the the ailich and Cathedral over the years and you know support for anything and so on and the current ten million dollars that you you 're giving to the cathedrals reinstatement and the contribution you 're putting into the the redevelopment of Cathedral Square I don 't think that the the Church properties trustees should would ignore that fact and demand that the memorial be removed oh you 've read the letter and they that when we get to the paper thank you very much for your submission thank you the next item that we 're going to receive deputations on as item 31 proposed process to provide policy support to the residential unit overlay and could I invite work chef Schaffer from the Christchurch coastal residents United morning I understand that you probably all understand what this is about now but just briefly it 's about putting clause that didn 't get into the plan into the plan related to the residential unit overlay which covers areas of South Shore New Brighton and Red Cliffs the first point I 've got on my speaking notes and I have to think you 've received them electronically really it 's just I feel this is a great chance and something that we need to collaborate on the coastal hazards chapter has been a rather torrid time for everyone involved I think in particularly residents who now are sitting on sections that they can 't build on and consider it taking up residence and tins and caravans I would love this to be a thing with together on and work on in fix it 's a great chance to fix something and we can get some runs on the board with that and on the basis is there hopefully we can do some bigger things after that I think that 's probably my biggest message about this I responded specifically to some points in the document and I 'll go through those now the next point I 've got down is kiss which is standing for keep it simple stupid we have a policy and we should use it I always say keep it short and simple it 's a much nicer way of the kiss expression the and the recommendations of the report agrees to use section 71 process of the Greater Christchurch regeneration 2016 to provide a policy framework that supports the residential unit overlay within the high flood management hazard management area so Meissen response to this is why is a policy framework required we simply need to put the missing clause back in why should say back in n is actually more correct so Judge Hansen states and is later that they 've been alerted so you know we could it shouldn 't be so difficult keep it simple we need to get a win on this we can do bigger things after going back to my first point this point three of the point three in the document I actually quite like what 's coming through in the document in some ways it 's quite creative thinking I can see in the end some inventive solutions to big problems all I 'm and I like that I 'm just saying this is not the time when we come to do bigger things we can ameliorate some of those ideas I think point three note that staff will investigate options and mechanisms to engage the relevant members of the independent hearings panel on the Christ to provide advice on policy development required for the proposal actually initially I thought why do we need to do that they 've got the policy if you know we 've got the NATO but actually sort of on reflection it might not be a bad thing it could be helpful to provide provided the existing clause completely at this stage it could lead us through quite a bad place this was right this clause was arrived at following a rigorous independent panel process so going back to the judges to get more clarification is I think potentially quite beneficial I 've added a kind of proviso and here that CCA you in effect at community boards should also be privileged to these discussions we don 't want a black box being created here which so often happens to you you bring an issue and counsel and various stakeholders go away and try and sort it out and they 're probably doing that best but from the outside it 's a black box you have no idea what 's actually going on here we 're saying so yeah point three I think it 's actually quite good one point five note that staff are required to continue to process any resource consent applications in accordance with current decisions policy and rules of the district plan so until such time as any nudists decisions operative now responds to there is this should be removed it is not relevant codifying what is currently happening the Hansen litre suggests current practice is wrong I 've got it here paragraph eight and if there 's time I can read it if you like as does it 's a reckless hearing outcome not no recommendation 6.71 see if it 's kind of long I think I 'll just summarize it and there 's the Aven River know that Oh Tucker Ito Aven River corridor regeneration pants essentially saying this what we do here shouldn 't conflict with that and what I 'm saying back to there is while attempting to make it better the clause would be in the plan as as now had things gone according to plan so what I 'm saying here is this needs to be the primary thought we in fixing this it would have been like this now we should not get too bogged down and wider considerations wider issues can be dealt with in the next step and they 're certainly going to be next steps and as I said before that document actually contains some interesting ideas that I think was sometime we can bigger and harder my second point so that really is about keeping it simple cutting it down getting in there with an editor so that we can do something that is really achievable and we can do it quickly and we can all high-five at the end of it we think the council should instruct regenerate to draft a proposal to the minister rather than it being done by council as the proposal currency currently so point to direct staff to prepare a proposal to amend the district plan and engage with strategic partners and regenerate Christchurch as required under the greater at Christchurch regenerating 2016 this should direct this should be direct regenerate to prepare a proposal for the minister to put the missing clause into the plan and engage strategic partners I put in brackets here including CCI you and affected community boards again I think is very important there the community is viewed as a strategic partner an interested party in this brings a lot to the table I think as well why regenerate regenerates its naturally in the middle of all interested parties and have experience report to the council by December 2018 worth the draft section 71 proposal for the minister or greater christchurch this should be instruct regenerate to report back with a draft section see anyone proposal in two weeks December 2018 means March 2019 it 's really in my opinion far too long something it should be much the final point I have on my submission is just some communication things that I consider to be misleading and press really defeat a little defensive table we just want to fix it we don 't need to be defensive we want honest brokers here so the point about thirty-one consents now when that 's written like that you think the subtext is sort of everything 's all right but it 's not the whole story those 31 consents are almost all relying on existing use rights you can use those throughout the high flood management area that the residential unit overlay has really been treated like it is just the height it 's like it doesn 't exist so to say 31 consents and have the subtext that there 's not a problem 's certainly problems with a long list of people that can 't build and we do need to fix there and we should acknowledge that point four point five there as a result there of this uncertain uncertainty there is a perception residents cannot build an affected areas I know these are little words in there but it 's more than a perception people that are having issues and again we need to acknowledge it we shouldn 't be putting things like there 's a document saying I 'm sorry you 've come to the end of your time and it 's such a shame because you 've raised issues that individual counselors want to ask about and but I did want to unfortunately your submissions predicated on an understanding of how section 71 works which doesn 't how it works in practice so and you know we really do want to find a solution to this so yeah it 's a it is a shame that you haven 't allowed time for questioning but we 're going to have to say thank you very much there and I 'm but I think that there does need to be a clear understanding of how section 71 works I mean you heard me stand up at the public meeting and New Brighton and explained that it 's a lengthy process and it is that 's why I would have preferred to reinstate the independent hearings panel but we can 't and you can see that the advice is there for their reason but we we we think we can speed it up as much as we can but it 's going to require every single one to collaborate but we need to control the process around this table so it 's a council law decision and I think that 's something that hasn 't been taken into account but we really appreciate you coming in and I know that you had to do that at short notice because you thought that you weren 't coming on so thank you very much okay so now could we have Tim Santa 's Sally buck and Daryl rate them morning who 's gonna kick off silly yeah well here 's a deputation from all the Lynwood simple Heath community board and we 're speaking for ourselves but we have the support of the following people tim sentece david east come money Tim Baker Linda Stewart Lynn of instant dance works the only enhance and elevate them Alexander David 's tell me Jake McLaren Brenda Leigh Johnson and myself silly buck firstly I 'd like to congratulate the council on acting on the concerns of the residents getting a report to this meeting but it would really like you to hasten the process so that we don 't have to wait for December to get a report back we believe this is a simple fix there 's no reason for you need delay my understanding is that while the RDA law has included in the plan the policy was at some stage I omitted from the painting provisions recently I spoke to one of the independent Hearing Panel meet members and they told me that the panel 's decision was very clear they wanted to give relief to the owners of residential his own land and make it easy for them to apply to build relevant RDA and this was to be done on a non notified activity basis Judge Hansen has also stated that the independent here his panel made a number of minor corrections to the plan he said if this matter had been brought to our attention we would certainly have aided the policy back into the plan there 's a minor correction I 'll leave it to Darryl and Tim thank you Thank You Sally first of all good morning everybody some observations from walk Warrick has said the basic issue with the report is that it is clouding and complicating what should be a simple fix sue John Henson supported by Judge Hess and certain Isleta that it could have been added as a minor correction if they have been notified the report is full of things like policy development talk of reconvening the panel dang it again to see if it is fit for purpose etc all of this is inappropriate this clause policy is the product of rigorous testing in front of an independent panel what has been developed and intended by their panel needs to be put runs on the board to start to build confidence again we 're requesting that the current recommendations an item 31 be amended there are principles of natural justice and fairness at stake here there have been various acknowledgement acknowledgments and recent public meetings and through the media where it would not be unreasonable for the public to have reached a view that the existence of an error has been acknowledged and that this would be fixed as a matter of priority therefore we contend that the delay until December for a report back from the public 's point of view is unacceptable this can be done in a matter of weeks not months I submit to you that the council must therefore take every practical action to reduce or eliminate the risk of problems escalating further if the current recommendations are adopted I believe this could potentially give rise to a degree of public uncertainty with potential repercussions for the council the council and councillors have the opportunity to not only do things right but also to do the right thing on behalf of affected residents that is treat this be resolved by council as soon as possible and I would suggest not by a report back from staff by Christmas but rather treated with urgency and resolved as an early Christmas present for the affected residents I do believe that if you don 't do it the government will do it for you thank you under than summarized on there I just I 'm just confused how we got to the stage it actually blows me away to think their time this has been brought up for so long and it 's taken all these taking all this work to get to the stage I don 't believe it 's been a team effort we 've actually you know I think we could have sort of the stats are so long ago as we all know we 've boarded up the community board had canceled so many times and to see it get to the stage is actually just for everybody positions you know as community board members we have to listen to the community and we hear their stress we feel their stress and it 's not fair this we 're all supposed to be a team we 're supposed to work together and get these things sorted out and we haven 't done it and I 'm really quite know quite an worried about it I just think it 's it 's the stress that this that we 've put people under there 's actually shocking I 've been really concerned as all of us have been we 've seen the stress in our community we 've brought it up and nothing 's been done about it till now and it took drastic action to get to the stage and all I can say is please get it affects our community for all of us and it 's work as a team on going onwards so you 've got a bit of time for questions but I just want to kind of start with the with the section 71 process because you know as you all heard me stand up and say at the meeting the section 771 process is a statutory process and it 's a very lengthy process individual strategic partners have given 30 days can take time before she publishes and then she has to receive submissions I mean that 's not a time frame that 's specified on the act and once we once the wording is submitted to the minister she can only say yes or no and the key the key to the decision-making that she will make is the advice that she receives from the Department of Prime Minister and cabinet so I think that we need to work collaboratively which means that we need to ask you to bring your communities along with this process and help them understand this process because it isn 't a straight forward process so the one protection that we want to offer and it 's a degree of comfort to the entire process so that every single strategic partner can sign off than five working days instead of 30 working days we want to tell them what members of the independent hearings panel say about the specific clause because there is nowhere in decision 53 that we can point to them saying what they thought of the wording that was provided to them the at least two of the members of the panel that actually heard I mean you 've quoted sue John Henson he didn 't sit on this part of the decision he was the overall chair of the independent hearings panel but he didn 't sit on this decision so the idea is to bring the independent hearings panel to provide written support or their members of it to provide written advice to support the insertion of the words so that we 've got a clear policy statement that supports the residential unit overlay so we are crystal clear that the decision being comes back to Council and then it goes to strategic partners and then it goes to the minister with out of the resolution we 'll take the December date out we 'll ask for an early report back to the council so that we can get it out to the to the strategic partners and to regenerate Christchurch and to the Minister so that that advice chain is supported by those that actually heard the submissions and are able to say that that the the in statement statement will support the residential unit overlay but if it doesn 't_''_3830.109 if it goes from our hands at this point then it won 't feed the councillors around this table that we 'll be able to make that decision so we need you to work with us in order to get the solution that we all want to get to this is the first time a resolution has come to council for us to consider this is the first time we had a notice of motion and this report is as a result of the notice of motion and there hasn 't been a resolution in front of the council on this matter at all before now so I 'm sort of saying that we need to I agree with you we need to work together but it requires us to both to understand the process and communicate that very clearly to the community because we 're actually all on the same side we all want the same thing if I might interrupt there I think you did right but I think we should sort of dissent earlier and brought to Council before so it 's not fair on councillors around the table to say that it 's been brought to Council we I have no and I 've said this I 'm not gonna say it now because I 've said it over and over again no I didn 't understand what the problem was you knew there was a problem and that 's all yes I know and I 've been investigating at for months or weeks and weeks and weeks so you know and ever since it was brought to my attention which was actually July and as I said before you know it was actually Daryl 's article that finally started me in the right direction but I still couldn 't get to the bottom of it until I reach the John 's leader but that doesn 't matter it 's how we go forward from here this is the first time the council as a whole is considering the solution which is to use section 71 of the Greater Christchurch regeneration Act and all we 're asking you to do is to make sure not straightforward it 's not simple and we cannot control the timeframes okay all we can do is ask the community to understand that we will do everything we can to make it as fast tracked as we can I just briefly comment on that and say thank you for the clarity that you have put around the issue and what you have articulated we will bring the community on board we will listen to our community and we will work together with Council on this issue as long as going forward we have that transparency and sense of immediacy thank you thank you right _"

    "text": "right so if we 're going to deal with these measures and the order that we heard the deputations I 'm happy to do that or we can just carry on with the water paper and and okay as in the order of the dictation so we 'll turn to item 28 draft heritage strategy approval for public consultation after the paper had gone out in our in our agenda three of the counselors have put their names forward for consideration for the hearings panel counselors Johansson Clearwater and chin so this recommends that we appoint the three counselors to the hearings panel and that we request that staff work with hearings panel members to ensure advisory and put from the Youth Council and heritage representatives and I think that that amendment certainly picks up on the significance of the deputation that we heard you 'd like to move that term seconded by Phil or I don 't know if you should seek and it the I 'm Erin Erin the second it so are there any questions on the paper is there any debate on the paper Jonnie you acknowledge that from the deputation the huge amount of work that staff have done and and it goes back even further to those first workshops and the North New Brighton pool and I just also really wanted to acknowledge the community who have come along and participated because we can organize workshops but if no one attends then they 're pretty valueless so you know the community have gone up a huge amount of time and energy to be engaged in this process and I just think we should really acknowledge that today alongside the work that our staff have done enabling that to occur so I didn 't really want to say any more than that other than I think the success of this draft strategy will be through the deliberations enabling a collective sense of ownership to whatever the final outcome is and I would say that it 's incredibly important to have I think young people and heritage people who have been so passionate really engaged in this and feeling like they are contributing to the decisions that the hearings federal making may make so just I think more needs to be said other than let 's get this out for public engagement in consultation and keep pressing it Sarah and Phil and Jimmy advocating for this heritage stretchy and asking for it every opportunity and it 's really good to see it get to the stage so and thank you and yawning is also acknowledge the huge work of the staff in we do too and I think it 's the early community engagement we 've done yes as bit was indicated one of the submissions that 's been excellent and I guess a big part of this is the future of air heritage you know I think that the other deputations today for example around the war memorial just show that the the interest and the passion that we have in our city are rare but the key thing are with with this strategy is how it will bring though the size of tangible clear parts of our heritage it will bring the intangible parts the stories of our heritage which each of us actually have so and as as it 's clear towards the following the consultation is that we will develop a whole heritage chatter ferocity so I certainly look forward to hearing the outcome from from the hearings panel we may be good especially prior to the strategy that our population ages style if we reviewed all those the principle one of the principle you know is a lessor City is a multicultural multi-ethnic city but we respect the tongue cutter afina one ni Tahu mesa city actually impressed all of them the Maui European could see for either Chinese Indian in all other the cultures so I 'm really impressed is regarding one of the principal story based approach acknowledged in respect to all our culture 's and also start make a practical you know the the action we consider style working together with the office of as a community organized supplier you know early stage roaster consultation to invite all those service and information sectors as well as wider the multi-ethnic multicultural representative and they 're the kind of leaders have a consultation they 're fairly made I was there because I 'm and Cheer or multicultural committee solar attain the answers and also Sooners divided the older the table you know to contributor when I would like to say this way we 're able to the law motto and from now on I 'll suggest this one she 'll be you know can be a prideful as some other councillor strategic attachment because if we look at the reality this society 25 percent was born in overseas and will be more in the more how-to way to imprisoning how do we take a positive way if we especially the council we launched the multicultural strategy in May of last year we need to fulfill implement Lisa strategy more effectively officially so I like particular a canal to stop well that thank you thank you I particularly like to reinforce all those comments particularly want to acknowledge because in lots of ways this strategy addresses the omission of the traditions that were intangible things that we as Europeans realized Andrew thank you this but as the chair of the previous council committee that had Heritage in terms of reference it 's a piece of work that I 've watched intently I 've got to say I 'm very impressed by the the draft strategy as its presented and also the huge amount of work that 's gone into it and certainly the work that Yanni 's done over a number of years has been acknowledged I think we should acknowledge Phil clear waters leadership in this space as well and which is nothing sort of excellent I 'm particularly impressed by the way that this is picked up conversations to be going on for some time around in heritage I think we 've picked up cultural heritage in a very meaningful way and it 's good to see that reflected in the makeup of the hearings panel with ruining our representatives there it 's also great to see three councillors obviously very passionate and wanting to be involved in this as well I think all of them August for a really good outcome from the hearings panel process and if the community get involved in the submissions and hearings process in the same way as they have in the early engagement I think we 're guaranteed of a good collaborative 've got in front of us today is an excellent piece of working draft and I hope that I 'm very confident it 'll be an excellent strategy and result from the great work that 's been done anyone else thank you I 'll put them resolution all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much thank you for

in a different thing on the half and Paul NC is good on yet so page 1 to 5 of the supplementary moved and seconded I don 't know if how you 're going to ask them any questions so it 's going to be tricky are there any good we are we 're special council that we attended Easter celebration earlier the end will receive English service of any service from the New Zealand elevation or multiple women suffrage country and 28th anniversary my babies and also some of the staff actually thank you hey thanks Jimmy cooling thank you I just like to touch on the water New Zealand workshop that the mayor attended along with myself you Vicki Jimmy and Dion but notice that she 's used the words here that they 're focusing on development of corporate water management structures and and I I detected at the nervous about being in Christchurch and presenting to Christchurch because they know how we feel and I was encouraged actually by to what I thought was a bit of a turnaround they do mention the word exemption and they didn 't mention the word the status quo might be of one of the options which previously those two things had been ruled out I took her to met but I 'm trying not to get too excited about it so what they wanting to do is set up a regulator and while retaining the water delivery and the water than to in public ownership be delivered and privately if you like in one tune that they repeatedly used all day was that we 've removed political interference and then consumed me a lot because actually removing political interference is actually moving democracy in my view so I just wanted to touch on it and and just good run for the money and Alistair Humphreys was incredibly vocal actually and being quite adamant they heard stays with the Ministry of Health and it 's really sorry if the buck stops but you might want to eat yeah I I thought it was a very interesting workshop and that their view was very deep predetermined I thought and what was interesting as SP people raised objection after objection after objection they quoted from another country completely to illustrate some point but clearly I thought Alistair Humphreys view on regulation was actually very clear their view was that there wasn 't regulation so he pointed out the section the subsection and the Act and the fact that the speaker who was actually saying there wasn 't any regulation it helped to draft it so he was stunning and so there clearly is regulation what he was saying is that the Ministry of Health is insufficiently resourced and then their views were that clearly councils having the three waters was really annoying structure because political people counselors made the decisions and clearly that was really annoying to them and and as Pauline mentioned the political interference was how they referred to elected members but the the most scary concept i swore from actually having been involved on the local government commission we 're in and the functionality of it was put together was their desire to rip out thirty four percent of our budget and put it into a separate authority and that separate authority from their point of view ran from possibly just canterbury to two-thirds of the South Island to the whole of New Zealand and the very clear driver for that was that a lot of those authorities could not afford particularly the wastewater actually and that that should be subsidized by the good citizens of Christchurch City and of the major urban areas so I thought there were major major flaws in their consultation I mean apart from the fact that their consultation involved them talking it people all the time but just into and and I don 't understand why local government New Zealand is so weeded to them and puts their articles in their use in the magazine and things anyway I think they 've got a very different impression I think they 've got a very clear impression of what Christchurch wanted but I think we need to be totally on top of it it has all our infrastructure there 's really investing money it 'll be wasted but and also it 's going to take quite a long time I expecting some response from the government to the report by October this new book they mentioned they wouldn 't really of substance an opinion to at least the next year and it could even be later so we have got time on our side too if she Cantonese improve that and we just need to stay five steps ahead of them I think okay if there 's nothing else sorry any such we 're sort of discussing the water issue in terms of corporatization it was really interesting and I hope that this council make a submission around the review into the electricity sector but the first report has just been released and what we need to keep in mind I believe is that the same agenda for the electricity corporatization and privatization is the same one that 's pushing the water they often use the electricity as a comparison to say if we go how they went then things will be better actually what the higher than in 1990 and since 2000 residential prices have risen faster than most other OECD countries and it 's just there 's a two-tier retail market where the poor are really punished and pay a huge penalty for not being able to pay on time and that there 's huge complexity and pricing structures so I think of anyone wanted an indication of what not to do it would be to look at our electricity sector which the water lobbyists keep comparing as a way forward for water and I think we should be incredibly concerned that the evidence is overwhelming that the electricity sector reforms have been terrible for the public and for the consumers and we don 't want water to go that way sorry and I just sickening Yanni 's statement because we 're on the MS Welfare Trust electricity point of order that 's besting the mayor 's report he recorded a freefall about the water in the miserable yeah but what 's it got to do with electricity pricing review I 'm just take teeming onto Yanni let 's go to do a lot it 's the number one kind of yeah yeah yeah well this is where we do it but the thing is like it 's the number one kind of chick disbursement thing on the me as well isn 't it so people see it rates as high but yeah yeah but the point of stroma is we need to be aware of the social implications of the change of awards delivery model amendment not

    "text": "just item 16 and although ji 101 of your report and Jimmy moods and Pauline seconds yep can I just um take a moment to update you on progress with water so state leader our Timmy pump stations which have been signed off by the drinking water Assessor for approval to supply an chlorinated water that means about 25 percent of waters city 's water is under chlorination you visited last month at Gardens Road pump station to see the kind of standard we 're attaining with this practice approach to water and infrastructure so that stays there too above-ground well heads each of a capacity of 50 litres per second so you can start to see what we 're trying to do around that in terms of well heat improvement update we 've got contractors on site at bounnam inside pump and they 're getting ready to convert the below ground to the above ground is with the gardens Road pump station and it would take that conversion will take about 55 days and it supplies about 5 of the homes in Christchurch Northwest zone about 1.8 million cubic looking at route upgrade the wellhead in Ganga water is on track to be finished in late October I 'm also looking at alternative disinfection so main pumps UV functional designs underway so there 's work being done by Becker we followed by tender and early November and we 're also investigating additional sites where UV treatment might be suitable we expect to provide a report to Council about the timeframes for stage 2 weeks in October so that 's coming up we 're of that in terms of ongoing inquiries and complaints which cover not just complaints about smell and taste there 's a range of issues so general information people wanting updates and where things are at as well as issues of concern so we had about 120 of those in August you 'll recall that the peak in May was around 366 they may well be more people phoning in or contacting us around issues as we start to take on or activate pumps that have been closed over the winter period and in terms of that the other thing is that there 's been obviously quite 're progressing plans for that but we 'll have the results from the Community Survey fairly soon and it will give you an insight into willingness of people to reduce water to help us to continue to hit towards a none coronated water supply just just around the there messaging for the the water conservation I 'm not sure if it 's been clear enough because there seems to be a lot of confusion and they always go straight to there are some some foreign company can take 10 million liters of water from under the city but the council 's telling us the safe water so my question will be have you got more plans to roll out other ways of informing people that that 's not actually the case they 're completely unrelated in the reason we 're conserving for the water that 's in pipes not what 's under the ground so that 'll certainly be part of the plan in terms of how we inform people and keep them up to date with things and the survey of courses about people 's willingness to participate in so make sure that people do understand what it 's about as opposed to you know just being stopping them drinking water pulling on it because we we use 50 percent more water and some in the summer than we do in the winter and in order to consume anything repair we need to switch off some pump stations which means that if we are using more water we won 't be able to switch those off so whoever will do the repair so there 's this going to be at the moment a voluntary conservation program or as that to be what is going to be determined by the survey if there 's a willingness for people to do that volunteering and if not we 'd we get to a set do we do we consult on whether to suspend the program or bring in water restrictions which we have had in the past yeah I think I think once we 've got the results there 's a conversation we need to have about what that actually means and then what approach you take towards water conservation because the do our very very best 12 months and we have to reduce the water consumption over the summer that may be that we need to restrictions so that 's I guess it 's a conversation we need to have but it needs to be an ongoing campaign so that it doesn 't I think one of the other risks is that you know people were supported initially and then it drops off so we need some ways mechanisms to make sure that it 's an ongoing campaign that gets us to the point where we can take the chlorine out of the water I mean the communities used to water restrictions which pop up every 2 or 3 years so in his seats it won 't be any different you know the community will have a view on me I just have to go easy on the player Kelley mine isn 't a Christian and Christians are just a couple of comments just there and the great progress in terms of the number now on the second tranche of where of what wells to remove the chlorine with with another pan but the other part too is the recent decision by council to develop the ultraviolet tip treatments as well the other thing I wanted to mention was the an addiction awards and achievements I 'm glad you 've written up about the unicycle and I 'm also glad that it 's reached Parliament by wherever notice motion and that 's an example though if we you know we shouldn 't celebrate and acknowledge our achievements so I 'm glad your report does that Colleen because clearly a huge amount of work has been done by our council it 's right and um there are some areas particularly in the sustainability where we can turn you teamed in the finalists around some awards so if there 's nothing more oh look the the motion those in favor please say aye those opposed carried to thank you _"

to move it right second I 'm sorry okay do you want to food it okay mover and seconder do you want to speak to it not have expansive questions what we 're going to do so are there any questions guys Aaron yeah so as much as I support the concept of an outreach service for six base workers and and help them as much as possible I still question how much we 've done around the safety for the girls that work in their industry and I look at the Health and Safety Act and all of the hoops and in the legislation that other people who are contractors or workers in every environment have to go through to keep themselves safe and my question is around the health and safety aspects of this industry given the number of murders rapes and torture that have come through this industry being on the it and if we potentially have any liability over allowing an industry to take place that is so dangerous mental probably it might be more fun for you around a liability yeah it 's not I think I can briefly answer it in terms of what you 're being asked to do today which is to grant 40,000 to the outreach organization I don 't think there 's any issue of liability tombs of us with regard to the street workers so I don 't think it 's an issue for today 's resolution or consideration matter so if you want to bring it up bring it up it 's a French so we have agreement would be um win would that be an issue but if you if you want to ask Elias you to provide you with some advice around it didn 't_''_154.489 we 're happy to do that yeah I I would be happy to get there okay okay I 'll indicate undertaking that was are there any other questions before we start the debate yep thanks I just wondering with the support from the community I this outreach worker was actually supported in this way from the community who have been involved in this as as it creek but that is correct and I received advise that that wasn 't able to be circulated to the council but a resident north of Elia did write a letter of support and has been very happy with the voluntary work that 's been undertaken and was particularly supportive of the addition which would come into place if this paid work were funded of having a street outreach coordinator who was contact able 7 because that currently is a gap in the services provided yes oh this this has come to us because if you remember and the 2nd of November 2017 we resolved to set up the street based sex work collaborative working group as a result of few deputations by some residents in the community part of that resolution said that the council would agree to consider funding and support of initiatives presented by the clare bridge a collaborative working group which is what we 've got today this is a collaboration of the community council staff they 've been working and we 've got variety and here from the prostitutes collective as well sorry it 's true what 's the actual name of that yeah that 's what I 'm sorry they 're here to support and and the the whole issues actually has done quite a 180 tune there was there was a lot of angst in that community around the street based sex work that was going on especially north of be Liev and the work that the collaborative group have done has actually turned that 180 and actually you know there 's been a lot of concerted effort to to communicate to the residents and actually get them on board and actually people were sort of creating their own little community there but one part of the missing piece is this this this outreach worker which we actually support the street based sex workers and also facilitate the need with the residents as well so this is actually going to help with the safety of the the workers on the street and actually help communicate what 's going on with the the residents did come and do the deputation is all for this and he is very supportive of this and and I do hope that we actually get this this passes because this is a direct resolution or direct result of that early resolution I 'm very pleased we have this report and I 'm also pleased that the the community board had have put in a significant amount of funding towards us and I think it 's great that a community lead project is actually working when it was very clear that the previous illegal is step one which would impose some further restricted conditions clearly wasn 't going to work so I think this is a great outreach I think it 's it 's going to be so important including around the health and safety parts the clearly the outreach worker will be involved whether you know supporting the the the prostitutes to to you know have safe conditions or as safe as possible so yep I 'm an example of where in fact I think it 's necessary as I know that housing first program have approached many of area of of housing needs for them so I think to think there 's a lot of work to prepare actually work to be done which an outreach look at keen and I 'm sure will do and I 'm sure very successfully so I 'm I 'm also very pleased about the work that 's been done and this is timely to actually support support the program with this funding thank you this is the oldest profession in the world and will always heaven so I guess it 's about how can we make it more safe for those participating and in regard to what Phil 's just mentioned for all those on the street with a street begging those homeless those working at night we have these various streams of work to of what Janice is working on it feeds into our housing subcommittee work as well the reasons for people working on the street are numerous and complex and it 's never a kind of a black and white issue so I take on board Erin 's comments but what can we do to fund it and of how together it 's a community we can work together to solve some of our community problems so it 's we have got this model working beautifully with our outreach worker working with the street because as is full has talked about and I think this is another example of collaborative partnership in action and I think it 's a good example of how the capital endowment fund can be used to specifically target quickly areas where we have recognized that something like this has to happen so thank you so much for the work that you have done Amy in the team it 's been amazing and we will really appreciate what you 've done I first just clarified the it 's not the oldest profession that 's it 's a bit sexually a line from a play or a poem by Homer or something called the wall if you look it up but it gets used a lot as a term so I do forgive Glen because we 've all heard it probably a hundred times yeah well it must be true where do you go after this is it 's an incredibly dangerous industry I the street worker industry I 'm not as hung up on the brothels or the call outs or any other arrangements but the six working on the street and in a modern era just does not seem like a good outcome for a lot of people involved sometimes the clients and that get a bit ripped off we 're stood over and things themselves as well but it 's the safety of the gills that really really concern to me I 've got the names of the recent murders all in front of me written down I 'm not gonna read them out because they 're all well-known but these are citizens of our city these are human beings that should just not be treated in that way under any circumstance our country has a real problem of sexual violence we don 't speak about it very often but we need to do something about it and by allowing this to still take place on our streets with without the checks and balances I admit that user outreach worker helps but they hop into a car with a stranger and go where they don 't know where they 're going to perform the X we know what they 're performing but there 's no safety in that there 's no other industry would allow female staff members to go and do that it just makes no sense that we still allow this to happen so for for crying out loud at some point we need to start protecting these very vulnerable people who a lot of them are sexual abuse victims themselves and they choose to get into a profession that has some very very serious outcomes at times and yes they are grown human beings but they have a number of other issues so let 's try and move to a safer community somehow you you dead but just to wrap up I 've been really really impressed with the working party and I want to acknowledge all the people that have contributed I haven 't_''_664.41 been on the working party myself but can I say that working together to identify actions to make this a more safe and a-a-and_:_675.08 on our local community that we 're getting very angry I think it 's been a really positive what is a positive thing and you know I I just think if you 're worried about people 's well-being then this is one of the best things that you can contribute to because putting having a human response to this rather than a legal or judicial response I think will make a huge difference and we 've already seen some of that it is regrettable that this project actually has taken so long to get funded but you know we are where we are today and I hope that people support it it 's a really important project for our city and I want to acknowledge the huge work that NZ DPC have done as well because you know there there have been there has been a lot of angst and anger by some but I think with the positive work that 's been going on in the background for you know over a year now we 're starting to see some really positive results so I really support this the the Working Party to fund the security-camera because we saw that as a real priority in terms of safety but it was felt that given that council established this working party that council should also take some responsibility to fund in its response and I agree with that approach you _"

    "text": "a series of papers that are sort of interrelated the central city revitalization action plan the central city residential program project 80 11 and development forum terms of reference or eighty double one I think I like that better so if we can yep if I forgotten summer I can live in places no no but we 're going to come back to these I 've got an obligation this afternoon and I 'm gonna have to leave so I 'm just doing these ones first though and you 'll have to elect someone to take my place would you like to cheer the meeting after I leave good excellent vote for Vicky Yeah right okay blue tell me is there any particular order you might simply suggest that we ask questions on 25 26 and 27 probably at same time and it might be that the effectively a bundle of papers yeah 26 the one line program is a subset of the secrets of the revitalization action plan which is paper 25 and the development forum terms of reference which jam you might and wish to introduce is and Central City and provide an exercise governance okay all right so so we 'll just look at the group of papers and so that 's 25 26 and 27 so do people have any questions on any of those papers Yanni its Jimmy thank you Peter prior to the meeting but there is a reference to an SGS report that regenerate crotchets had done around the economics and the planning we are we able to get that or have that circulated because it seems to be quite an important underpinning document the SGS report we 're requesting that form regenerate Christchurch okay and we 're likely to get it all we don 't know that obviously you made that request yesterday evening we 're on to that so okay and just in the council 's own share an idea central city planned we talked a lot about social and affordable housing is there anything in the review and the reflection that 's that 's supporting us actually doing something in that regard in the project 880 11 one of the the project areas specifically addresses supporting the Central City offer about alternative housing approaches affordability social housing etc is would be part of that project so is it specifically mentioned in the project scope then I also just like that part of the project at 00 work we 're also and there 's also a an action around looking it it lend Holdings in general acknowledging that before our Sydney for council there isn 't necessarily a lot of it but there is a piece of work and then looking at incentives the range of incentives that that might encourage and different forms and types and tenures of housing it is also part of the program it talks about alternative development and housing tenure models it doesn 't talk as ICA about the development of social housing in the in the Central City [Applause] so this is on page hundred fifty nine hundred and sixteen of your agenda just sorry Brown s is on the same page I think I think y 'all gotta click on dancin that Krishna is best cocaine we 're talking about diversity and innovation to housing delivery key stakeholders a community housing ro New Zealand so it is about different options for building housing which would include social yeah I mean I just wondered if it could be more explicit on page or on our share an idea plan it was noted that council has 116 complexes throughout the city which is sustained image this provides an opportunity to consider relocation of some of these properties closer to Central City for easier access to facilities and services which obviously makes a lot of sense so I support getting people living in the inner city but it would be nice to see that there is encouragement of social housing and affordable housing being part of that explicitly I don 't think we disagree I think the mechanism for that is slightly different to this if you wanted to have some of the development of the next tranche of social housing we occur in the central city that would be fantastic and but I don 't think this is the best mechanism to achieve that you 've got a and probably some alternative mechanisms and given it the cancer was one way or another funding that yep good start in like I 'm just wondering on the next stage of development if in fact some particular population groups we might be able to develop facilities for I guess in a the city to be thriving for young people and for young people to be involved in a central place to if there is an area which might still be able to be developed within the Central City action plan this there 's still room it is an outline to explore other ideas that focus on particular groups you know the opening of Hoyts in the next month or so will be an important attractor but other projects that we might come up with through for example the end alive in place is probably to trial and test things maybe things that we 'll add things and we 've just attended the the expo of the strategic priorities around this and there was some good feedback through that so we 'll take away ideas from that is we refine and put more detail behind each of these high-level actions to engage with the various youth groups the Youth ideas in understand what will make them come in to Jimmy [Music] except the field he mentioned earlier youth youth council pool or maybe the Racing Association this group my understand is they are quite a few new kinda of the intrapreneur increased in the central city for multi-ethnic multicultural weather their opportunity informed we got into this throughout the kind of the Central City action plan and so this is a draft as it is today and prior to the report coming back and its final form by the development forum and would be looking to engage and a far wider group of stakeholders including the ethnic communities in the Central City if they 're cuter there 's in another diverse communities within Central City as well and it would mind aspiration of residents groups and residents associations the mix our dates are cute bad young is this some good time to sort of add something in or make suggestions as well yep in number three on I 'm just looking which paper you 're referring to there are thickest it is this one isn 't it yes it 100 of the agenda number three improve the condition safety and accessibility our streets public spaces in the simple city can we thank you guys know where I 'm going to come to this can we actually explicitly put somewhere potentially in that around the greville sites within the Central City they 're really detracting from safety and baby not on the immunity palette its bits and bits and one of the resolutions the central city am i looking at we 're doing the action plan or the project no.11 no no we 're asking questions on all three papers but just now I 've lost it because which which paper we were referring to I think there was something within the central city residential program yeah but there 's an amendment this sorry that the development forum has asked for can somebody can you lift up that that a toe double one yeah so it 's got can you go to the development forum recommendation okay so if you look at six I 'm assuming that it 's the development forum recommendation that will be moving regress requests DCL to the development forum within three months on a range of tools and centers and disincentives for land banking undeveloped land giving timeframes for each action to fast-track residential development and the regeneration of the same facility to assist in the goal achieving the goal of 20,000 living so it 's actually fix up those sites as well I 've been not at all the tool but the reality is that we 're going to have some of these sites in the city for some very long time yeah what I don 't want anymore is in the core of our central city any of these gravel pit car parks so I mean whether they stay car parks but they 're sealed and actually look and actually respect the risks of the the the amenity value of the Central City I just think that might be a good place to put it already underway looking it I 'm working with in particular Wilson 's but but others also to improve the amenity looking to work with the vacant site owners look at how we can activate those nuts and its the long term but what I what I want is I want to put an end date to allowing grevilles sites in the central core of our central city I think we need to just be pretty blunt on this and say there needs to be a date where no more gravel pits in our central city end off like I 'm not talking about within the four hours but just within the area is bound by we 're all the rest of the workers and actually you know start actually lifting the game of our central city because I think that 's you if you look at the life in sorry the the survey that came out what was that one called it suggests to me and I 'm sorry for interrupting Dion but I think it 's a good conversation to have but how do we get it in this yeah just probably just finish I think it 's a good conversation to have but I don 't think the place for it is the terms of reference for the forum I think the discussion for it is I think that we can continue this at the development we do need advise you know things are gonna come back and what you 're asking for a specific advice on I 'm just wondering which which one of the papers that would go into well I 'm looking at point at page 100 it 's not it 's not a part of a resolution so which which particular paper is it we would consider that it 's already part of number six the resolution up there with staff coming back to you on the range of incentives disincentives flame bacon undeveloped land but how about insuring and putting an after undeveloped land ensuring amenity of of sites within the CBD we can absolutely you 're already doing it yeah well we just we don 't want to trip ourselves up with um what for the foreseeable future is still a permanent activity by rushing to what the solution could be it might well be that we get to the same place with some other incentives to develop or disincentives to leave as undeveloped gravel car parks the skeleton let the purple box immunity and activation we 've got two high-level actions get creative with vacant sites and also enliven places which is around improving immunity add interest and activity in I would see those as being the the hooks under which we would develop more detailed pieces of weird connections that and what you 're talking about would sit under I 'm pretty comfortable with the messages that we 've heard in bit the high level points are there for us and take it forward but I think I think they 're getting the point we 're up you know I want to see those sites tied it up yeah I don 't think you 're alone it 's a big problem and I think we need to address within the singles are there any other questions that will go through them one by one so I wanted to ask some questions about the central development forum terms of reference yeah so I just wondered about the the membership aspect there so this will be page 1 2 3 1 2 3 so the first bullet point there is a specified time period I 'm just wondering is about the possibility of that leading to precedent for other committees and have we got any precedent for that happening yeah for our council committees I don 't for example I don 't know of any current council committees we co-opted members would have voting rights but clearly there are some who who don 't and that 's referred another one point and this wondering about if in fact I missed something or concern Christian as well as create potentially create please can only make recommendations to counsel yes so yeah so the where I was pets confused as that that also be non-voting members so would I would have thought if it 's a forum Lee and all members at the forum wouldn 't affect ever vote the only thing is that the intention ER and the non-voting members is if you look at the membership breakdown there are the elected members which will now be the committee of the council there are the invited members which are the representatives from key organizations which are you know the repeat offenders know of and we see see often but then from time to time will bring a non-voting members because we don 't need to bring in a whole you know army of people for issues that aren 't relevant to them so if for instance we 're looking specifically at residential will be and bringing in EPS members of you know those developers that are that have been involved in residential development people you know project managers in that field but it 's not they 're not needed to be at every single development forum meeting so it 's it 's a meeting by meeting approach I guess and that 's the intention around there is that we want their input because it was valuable but we 're not going to request them the presence at every single meeting when the knowledge or the expert knowledge base doesn 't have any relevance to the items we 're considering any other toes that the subcommittee you have subcommittees of the development forum you know so just little action committees to get things done and bring it back to the forum so this way to be engaging of all of the counselors recognizing the importance of the CBD and and then also enabling of setting up of you know smaller committees just to go away and do the work and bring it back I just think this is about ensuring this forum is focused on action for the next Welford till the end of the term I 've got no problem with that at all but it just seems to me that with the non voting and voting members that it would be bit in my view will be better for the fun for the function to be to make decisions by consensus and not busy everybody would agree and then that would overcome this problem that sort of forum can do yep well I mean I through James are it tends to doesn 't a Jamie decided my seemed yeah my charities are as always very much consensus yes just because with the ëismsí anyone was we have a mid ready I can but record so never we never have and it 's really just it 's kinda like room that Francisco where they engage with members of the community and also council and I think that 's what sparked appealing about this is it 's a JV committees with with the private sector in community as well as elected members so we do we do make decisions by recommendations by can substantial change to this as the bringing of the residents associations and to the max which I think it 's fantastic I 'm all for above what in terms of membership why don 't we today I mean this to say in fact the members will the forum would attempt to make decisions by consensus simple yeah I just wanna know the implications are essentially that 's how we do it anyway is there 's you know part of decision-making you know we sit around the table and reach a consensus and if there 's some just you know contrary views then we try and find some middle ground but that 's that 's sort of we do that with every committee I think you cheer that way as well leadership style leads in their way and people just men technologists would be gonna vote for you I think that 's it 's it 's deliberately flexible and terms of who can be involved we want to action alright ok so let 's go through each of the papers so the first one oh so yeah it it was a question of what sort of staff one of the really interesting things reading through the regeneration report and the analysis is the impact on unconstrained growth into the Greater Christchurch area and the impact that that 's had on the central city so the the information clearly identifies the issue but it doesn 't appear to be any clear action to address it particularly in light of the future urban development settlement pattern work that we 're doing so is there a recommendation or action that we should put in in response to that that would be helpful I think I think the sorry I voted for Public Engagement down just to clarify the central city in terms of its residential offer if you like in the central city is going to face competition from everyone everywhere in the areas but also the existing suburban area and the redevelopment that 's that 's going on across so if we exactly we we operate in an environment where people couldn 't exercise their choice on where they won 't want to live therefore that really becomes the challenge arises to is to make the central city the most attractive choice and and get people to want to live in the central city in preference to living elsewhere if if that 's if the central city suits their lifestyle they 're looking for of appreciate that people to have choice but by being permissive in terms of urban sprawl we create a doughnut in our Central City it 's not very you know it doesn 't I just wondered at what point do we say actually we 've got sufficient land we 've got this desire to have people living more densely in the inner city and therefore we we don 't need as much land being rezoned to you know because it was at the moment it 's having a really negative impact which the research seems to show from permissive and we 're not getting the results we desire essential city so I would have thought at some stage there should be an action around being a little bit more restrictive or not as permissive could be could we make it more reinforcing and if you go to the Central City residential program recommendations item to go back oh sorry I forgot yep okay so number two is notes the increasing residential the increasing residential activity in the Central City as a current strategic priority and has been a consistent priority for the city and Greater Christchurch for many years as reflected in the 2007 Greater Christchurch urban development strategy notes that the importance of a prosperous and Diamont Central City to the success of the sub region has been recognized by the Greater Christchurch partnership committee and chief executives Advisory Group and as a priority for the future development strategy currently being prepared by the partnership so since which time we are aware that there may be some changes to the future development strategy draft before it goes out so so maybe we want and here noting so vibrant Central City to the success of the sub region comma and that has been recognized by the Greater Christchurch partnership committee and chief executives Advisory Group comma ensure that this remains a priority for the future development strategy currently being prepared by the partnership does it pick up your point yeah I mean I personally would like something stronger but that 's yeah if that 's what we can get and that would be good yeah we are of course briefing the great akashic partnership on Friday about this program of work and maybe the mechanism to achieve something stronger would be a council decision wean their draft 50s it comes to Council yep all right I think that 's a tidy provision here though it 's making it clear that we 're sticking to sticking to the the intention that 's always been there that this is a greater Christchurch central city doesn 't just belong to the city yeah absolutely and it has been formally recognized as such by and reaffirmed in the recent months by the greater Christchurch partnership and obviously we 've had amazing councillors in reaffirm and that the CBD of Christchurch is of course the CBD of Greater Christchurch and they recognize in supported as such yep thank you alright so the first paper is the central city revitalization action plan driver movement in a seconder I have fun Dion move and Jamie second Oh is there any discussion yeah Tim though Xeon and Jamie you 're not fiction I 've sit at a number of time on it it 's actually been Jamie Dion cos I think you moved to say your engine do you want just a suggestion and it 's your call obviously but do you want us to speak to all three of them and in one day because it 's essentially all until needed okay so maybe all three happy to know ball three I mean the tip mover and seconder I 'm up so close okay so are we gonna speak to all of them at the ones I 'm just doing one they can 't go all right so Tim you 're not thank you um I 've seen it a number of times and I are we a better bit kind of enhancing all that type of thing within the central city we mentioned Hoyts before you really look at Hoyts if people coming on the bus they go to voice there are 17 food outlets remember those 17 food outlets will be in competition with other food outlets already in the city so people can actually go to Hoyts go to the movies go to get food leave on the bus again and there 'd be absolutely no activation for the entire Central City there 's no retail etc so we 've got to be careful I think how we go through if we look at new bright and I 've been out there a number of times go fantastic and playground FC outstanding you go out there it 's busy flat out wonderful library go 50 meters into the mall go a hundred meters into the ball god forbid you go 300 meters into the mall we see activity where 's the activation we 've got to be so clever and careful going forward a lot of the events that are held in but keep in mind you have 10,000 people turning out for peaceful lights or Bettina delights car parking is adequate but not for 10,000 people in one Hut so that 's actually a negative side of things that people see under pressure and then all the retailers closer and then they 're at night so we 've got to be really clever and and careful and how we activate we used to do some very simple things in the city we were without Christian leaders in this country at doing what we were doing with those small events and their activation and focusing on why we were doing them so I think we 've actually got a stop take some unrest and really look at how we can mix urmise the central city easily and there are some real cost effective ways to do this I will support this out question but I do think we 've actually got to be really clever and maybe revisit what we did in the Cathedral Square 20 years ago with the gang issues that we hid and also the the the times when it 's not a new phenomenal phenomena so yeah I 'd be really quick shift where we go for our fill and thank you for this report too because I think it brings together a lot of excellent work that 's been done not only by Aaron and council staff but also it 's really cross agency so clearly development Christchurch have had a big hand and helping pull this together and I think it 's really timely and the information the report is really timely because it 's Chamber of Commerce indicated to us earlier today we 're really on the cusp of development and it can go one way or the other and I think our decision earlier helps it hit in the right direction but also the projects which are also known lined up including the town hall that the other major facilities in the report runners coming coming on stream very soon and which has been mentioned and I think it 's is a good example of what will cater for a lot hundreds of people including young people but I 'm pleased that as a development for a young people in our city I think we know that the current market doesn 't really provide for young people an example that previously did of course was science alive but there has to be an alternative to the to the pubs for young people to attract young people to come into our city but I 'm pleased that there is plenty of scope in the development of this paper for there so and altogether though the I think and the the paper also does encapsulate that need to have a real drive to have housing in our central city included so there 's a section there called doing the groundwork and I note that besides business attraction alongside there is housing delivery so I think altogether it 's a very good paper and gives me a lot of hope for the future thank you thank you Jamie speaking to all three of these there in the recommendations and obviously the development forms recommendations on on the tombs of reference to the development forum which is just to include ECL and also put some time frames around the importance of the CVD truly can 't_''_1909.57 be underestimated the success of our city on the whole will largely be defined by the success of the central city so if our central city is failing or fails then our city is failing or fails now that fact can daunt you but I think as a council we acknowledge that we accept it is the ultimate challenge we 've recognized the opportunity and we 're going to roll up our sleeves and play our part to address this head-on so the central city is the Metropolitan melting pot of the whole city it 's the poster child both domestically and internationally for Christchurch and why the heart of a city is so important is no one visits Rome because of the great malls you know they exist and they actually do quite well but it 's the culture and the history and the buzz of the city that will draw you there to put it another way if you want to spend a weekend over in Sydney you don 't jump on water for trivago in search for Sydney suburbs want to be in the Sydney CBD and the fact of the matter is they do have great suburbs and if you go to go there you 'll probably visit Paddington and Surry Hills but it 's the heart that will draw you in there so I guess the point that I 'm making is that if we don 't have a strong heart nothing else is even going to work that is the foundation for the success of Greater Christchurch both the outlying suburbs and also Canterbury as a region and I think they know I think the likes of Selwyn and in Waimakariri most certainly cognizant of that fact I 've seen it earlier today but at the crux of it that 's it 's not actually the public sector that rebuilds the city will play our role hopefully effectively and efficiently to act as the catalyst to provide leadership and certainty for the private sector but by doing that that enables them to get on and do what they do best so some aspects are within our control in some not in our control and if you where they mention a number of the barriers that are holding us back they include cost of construction cost of land amenity value parking consenting to name a few so some of those we can address some of them we can 't_''_2029.87 and some of those we can affect and directly and we 're up to their challenge what we do know though is that what we 're doing currently is not enough I believe this council really does understand the gravity of that situation knowing it that gives me a lot of comfort there 's no silver bullet but the residential component I believe is the closest thing you will ever get to there that brings in the critical mass and with critical mass comes greater investment comes reinvestment and the creation of community value so I 'm very supportive of the three three items that we have here in the recommendations and I look forward to tackling this challenge head-on because I do not believe that there is a more important issue for Christchurch right now I 'm gonna wind up with them Oh eonni there 's a and it 's quite hard you know having all this just that counsellor we get into too much detail but I think what 's really disappointing and clear from the current state assessment by regenerate Christchurch is that the two key things that people wanted through share an idea have largely failed to be delivered and that was about people in place and environment and ecology it 's so disappointing that the environmental aspects of a new city post are born out of the post earthquake opportunity has failed to be met and you know without quoting going into all the details that 's in here it does make it really clear that we 've missed the opportunity hugely around a sustainable modern green city and I think that 's a real shame it 's certainly I think as council wasn 't a lack of trying through this council I think there 's a lot of other reasons why that didn 't happen which was mainly to do with the previous central government but I think also the key thing is that they weren 't even indicators set up to 's move forward and learn the lessons of what 's failed in terms of the blueprint why I would question how successful it 's actually been if it wasn 't for huge public sector investment and bringing government departments back into the inner city and buying up land you would really have to question how much other development would have happened by the private sector and it seems to me one of the lessons should be that the cost of putting public projects on private land is a recipe for disaster for delay and for economic irresponsibility so there 's a lot of really interesting things in these reports I hope that they focus on the environment and the social doesn 't get lost in all the lingo and jargon that 's put in place I think it 's incredibly important that we do go back to counsels original share an idea and central city plan that talked about the importance of having social housing in the Central City so that people could access the services that were more accessible and hopefully in time we can address it but I is really not leaving us in a very good situation and one of the most significant quotes from this report is that there was a best-of project approach rather than a best-of City approach and for some of us that have been around since the first earthquake it 's been really disappointing that the number of times that people that counts the former council tim carter and i raised the idea of synergy without anchor projects has been really instrumental for the good of the city that that wasn 't taken on board and i think you 've seen some of that in the stadium debate that we 've had earlier so I welcome this information I think the more inclusive we can involve people in the solutions to addressing the problems the better we will be but you know it is a pretty damning picture of the blueprint and its failings around getting a green modern sustainable city for people Thank You Dion one of the signs that I 've been saying a bit around as do we want to be known as a city of great suburbs or of Christchurch and Christchurch the second-largest city in New Zealand has an opportunity to actually be the you know that second city of New Zealanders where you know Auckland is going to go through some massive challenges into the future we as the alternative people want to live somewhere and we 're already seeing people moving to Christchurch to take up the opportunity it 's cheaper to live here there 's these opportunities abound but we need the central city where people will want to go and where that economic heart will actually pump and thrive for the region this this paper is really good I mean one of the you know what the report from regenerate Christchurch really does paint a pretty grim picture of where things are at at the moment but it also says is a massive opportunity to actually turn this around show some leadership as a city and actually go look Christchurch has all of the markings to actually be a be their second city of New Zealand and actually take the opportunity and take it to take it in hand the amenity and activation what I was saying before putting putting Wilson 's on notice almost to say you know what the central city is not a car park in terms of these off Street these off street gravel pits it 's actually a place where people would people have been to be the growth the prosperity the economic viability of the city you know how do we start attracting hit officers back to Christchurch we lost a lot of those than the earthquake after the earthquake how do we bring them back bring back that employment bring back agencies and all those kind of things where people can actually start growing their careers here learning and then moving forward in that respect and then the people part so the other part the project data one one I mean this is absolutely vital I mean everybody 's keep saying let 's let 's do what we can to get people living back into the central city now we actually have some focus on this now we 've got to sort of show that city leadership which is the first part here in the central the other paper here it 's really really critical that the Central City residents who I 've already invested in the central city are part of this and this is really critical actually you think this is probably the most innovative part of all of us is actually the Central City residents associations those people who are living here and are actually going to be part of the decision making process part of the process and also all the developer our developers and investors can be part of it then we can get by and collectively ownership of the the outcomes and actually people will then serve a sense of pride in their city and actually you know you do the things that we 're saying that we 're going to do and there 's the last part getting it done on side I was elected on let 's get it done so let 's go do it I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you for _"

    "text": "all right so we 've got the notice of motion and it 's been moved by Councillor your hints on and seconded by Councillor Livingstone so I 'll just open it up for debate Jonnie would you like to so basically just to say that just to give a bit of context to this I first want to just acknowledge that the two community boards had a joint seminar on the 13th of August and that was actually really useful and we saw the presentation that Warwick has given to councillors today which I think actually quite clearly showed that there was an intention to have a policy but that the policy was not adopted in the final district plan so I actually think when you distill it down and its most simplest form it 's quite clear that there was an intention of the hearings panel that has a policy that enabled development provided the mitigation could be put in place and that hasn 't translated into our final district plan so I really just wanted to acknowledge that that joint briefing from the community boards was I thought for regardless of how we got to this point an opportunity for councillors to put it right we need to fix this problem which is clearly an I did fight issue that is causing huge stress and an huge strain on a number of people in our cities so today I 'm really proposing a notice of motion to get a way forward to address this it obviously has to be more work done around around the best mechanism to do so I just want to highlight how unique we are in Christchurch if this had happened in any other city or district in New Zealand there would be very easy processes that could be done in a matter of weeks to sort this out because of the unique and extraordinary powers that the previous government put in place regarding our district wedding we are at a huge advantage where we cannot make changes or deal with errors or omissions in a much more streamlined way that other people could so we need to get some advice on the best way forward we need to treat it with urgency and 's a in fact I 'll save that for wrapping up in terms of rudder why so I 've introduced a notice of motion I know that there 's other things that other councillors have wanted added to it but in fairness to everyone because there were stuff that people haven 't seen I don 't think it 's appropriate to do that today I certainly welcome other opportunities for us to continue to look at how we adjust what 's gone on but I think today is about moving forward and getting councillors to take responsibility with a clear direction to the organization to fix this problem Thank You Glenn Thank You Leanne it 's just to recap with what Yanni 's said this is not a new issue it first made its way to the South Shore residents Association on Wednesday May the 30th where it was explained in great detail to a good turnout of residents both Council at East and I were present the following that outcome both the board in combination with the little central head cut board that our joint briefing on this with media or not on September the 3rd this was taken up by the board close to bill wood by way of formal resolution to write to the to local EMTs puttel williams Ruth Dyson on Monday between thought was to for calendar weeks before September the 3rd the minutes of the joint board meeting are on your hub if you wish to check them that they simply note the discussion they don 't serve to make any value judgments or ascertain who did what or didn 't do what it 's certainly notified as a discretion rather as a discrepancy there are several reasons why we have these planning rules as you know I 've got a whole list here going back to July the 17th last year with the flood and you can add all the different water levels high tide etcetera going up but at this point I just wish to acknowledge yoni and my colleagues and and also the professionalism of our planning staff whom I have known for three twos and I I begged them to the help so I hope we will find a way look I would like to acknowledge councillor Johansson for I 'm putting this remit forward and commending him for doing so I particularly like the item four of the agenda of this recommendation and it really does address the issues that before residents in South Shore South New Brighton and reakless the huge financial cost and psychosocial stress that these people have been put under because of the unfortunate I 'll call it the unfortunate era in the district plan that we find ourselves and now these people have suffered acutely and some of them you know tens of thousands of dollars so I 'm totally in support of what we are doing here it 's a step in the right direction and I think even item three gives good good logic around resolving the issues that have been raised in relation to the end the hearings panel decision on the district plan so I believe this is a good motion going forward I support it totally and it will go a long way to starting the process of mending the wrong that was created such an injustice in in thank you look I would like to make a couple of comments myself I 'm actually very grateful to Sir John Henson because this letter has helped me understand something that I have struggled to understand since it was really first brought to our attention largely in in July the May meeting I wasn 't aware of and South Shore but certainly from July I 've been following it with great interest staff had provided me with advice and I was advised and been aware of the main road decision that might be helpful in terms of providing some clarity as to what the what the rule absent the policy amendment would actually require and unfortunately when that decision came out it said that it was wasn 't forming a precedent and it wasn 't to be taken as providing any specific direction and so I felt that it was and we were actually between a rock and a hard place we didn 't really know how the district plan would apply which meant that it was hard to go ahead with confidence as an owner of property in the going to be required to do in order to mitigate against a future risk and so the organization we 're providing me with some legal advice on that and I 'd met with the community board just just before this was released I 'd have the litter and having the letter now has enabled me to really completely understand the sequence of events so so and it 's absolutely crystal clear to me that the independent hearings panel wanted to have an effective rule and I don 't believe that rule is effective without the amendment to the policy so I believe that as a as a council we need to take steps to amend the district plan or correct the district plan in order to ensure that the intention of the independent hearings panel is able to be reflected so I really appreciate councillor Hansen 's wording around the fourth element of this resolution I do think that there has been a loss of public confidence in terms of the district claim process and so the chief executive is working with the office of the Auditor General in order are seeking and and I believe that when we approach central government for a mechanism to amend our district Lee and as counsel Johansson has pointed out it was the previous government that made the decision to prevent us from touching our district plan for five years after the independent hearings panel had done their job so you know and if that sounds like I 'm being a little bit critical it is because I am and I think that that was an unforeseen we 're experiencing an unforeseen consequence of such an extreme provision being imposed on the City Council in this City Council alone no one else has been put in this position so we can 't we don 't have an easy process for doing it we 're going to have to approach government and work with them on it at the same time because of the level of confidence I 'm also going to ask the minister whether she would consider re-establishing an under pendant hearings panel so that the coastal hazards chapter can be completed with confidence and and in a relatively quick way as regret for a minute taking that coastal hazards chapter out because I actually think we 're going to be in a better position to understand the complexities and this environment the coastal environment going forward as a result of the very issue that 's been raised so I 'm I 'm really thankful to you council your heads and for putting this on the agenda so that we can clarify these matters thank you and I 'll let you wrap up the debate so in conclusion what you have in front of you today is an opportunity for action we 've had more than enough talk on this issue it is clear there 's a problem and it 's time for action and that 's what today is about I want to acknowledge the Christchurch coastal residents United group because they know that they 've put a huge amount of effort into this and particularly Warrick who presented this morning because it was the simplicity and the clarity that he provided to our community boards at that joint briefing which I was at that really helped me understand that there subcommittee memo that went around on the 28th of November 2016 and I just wanted to quote that let 's see restrictions on use and development of residential land in the H F H MA with one exception the decision largely confirmed the proposed rules to the development in the H F H M a in most cases subdivision and new development is a non-complying activity the exception is restricted discretionary activity status for new dwellings annexed actions to existing dwellings in the residential zones at New Brighton South Shore and grid closed areas where the activity status applies are identified by the residential unit overlay within the H if HP MA the panel noted that the flood risk in New Brighton South Shore and reckless is predominantly with sea level rise and that appropriate mitigation of flood risks is possible they found that a restricted recessionary activity status provides for a more focused assessment and that consent may be refused if the flood hazard meters are not addressed it was part of having a enabling clause within our district plan to ensure that people could develop if they could i think is a sensible sensible way forward so in conclusion please support this today there will be a time to look at a more collaborative approach to land use and district planning with our communities and I hope one of the lessons out of what we 've been through highlights that that is a positive way forward you will recall on a number of occasions I 've been critical of the fast-track district planning process that took control away from local elected members and put it into a hands of government independently appointed people so we need to think about the impact that that 's had on our community last night at a public meeting in ricklefs a person asked the question of the audience who here knows how the district plan was developed hardly anyone put up their hand we need better communication about what has been done to us as a city by the previous government in regards to district letting so that people understand where responsibility lies for some of the issues that people are confronted with however as I 've said today is about recognizing move forward and fix us due to the huge impact that 's having on local people within our local communities that 's why I put this forward we need to take responsibility as elected councillors for sorting out this problem and I urge you to support the notice of motion thank you I 'll put that motion all in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried unanimously thank you _"

    "text": "at least just for item 14 please know it just for item 14 yep thank you all right so now we 'll move on to item 24 council priorities for capital acceleration fund moved by the ref seconded by Dion so we 'll start off with with questions or is there did you want to make a presentation No all right so I think so we just open it up for debate it 's probably the best thing I appreciate you have a question based on the first some issues errand question whether counsels are brides you know have to go to the puppy consultation regarding to the farm the additional three hundred million dollars so I 'd refer you cancellation to section 2 of the report so the significance assessment in the report and also conscious of the decision that is being sought from you today so emphasized in the report that for an absolute sake of clarity the decision being sought from you today is on the proposals and that you will put forward in stage one and so the indicative proposals for allocation for the three hundred the final decision today and if those proposals going forward and those proposals are accepted by joint ministers and then we 'll work up the detailed business cases in the detailed business cases will equally come back to Council for approval before being submitted again to cabinet for stage two thank you him I 'm just point five can the the multi-use stadium shouldn 't be multi-use arena we 've changed the names a couple of times on with us an arena or Stadium my understanding is that the current terminology that we 're using is a multi-use stadium but I 'm happy to be corrected and the intent is as was articulated in the presentations this morning that it 's a multi-purpose multi-use not simply a rugby field with seats around can we just change 5 to arena stadium because I think it that is an important point because in that point was made today it 's not just a stadium have you got questions one question here one question there one question Andrew yeah Andrew clean and Yanni thank you I 'm just seeking some clarity around the by governments of the time of 50 contribution in the cost-sharing agreement relating I guess to Klaus be in the shed you 'll relating to the stadium you 're able to just give some guidance around that because I 'm aware that there was an issue raised in one of the deputations this morning that obviously your guidance on this or your interpretation may well provide some guidance as we work through that issue sure so the the co-ceo agreement that was agreed and so on boy the council at the time in 2013 and the government at the time provided a number of options in terms of a stadium and and the interpretation of the clauses and the cost share agreement so it 's pretty clear that the council contribution is at a maximum 253 million dollars that 's stated and then is some optionality depending lean on with that counsel and crayon went with a I think it 's 35,000 seat and their cross your agreement covered Stadium in the CBD and there 's a two hundred and sixteen million dollar gap and that in the cauchy Agreement that was to be determined was there could be a variety of contributions from the private sector and philanthropic funding and or any other mechanisms for funding and the stadium was costed in 2013 35,000 covered at five hundred and six million so the council 50% sheer is very clear and what 's not clear in the reason that we don 't have a stadium or any progress on the stadium is that the remaining funding gap has never been closed so and the reality is the the the work that 's been undertaken has never been able to close the funding gap so the 300 million capital acceleration facility the purpose of that was to provide certainty in the option for you today as to close that funding gap in via for provide the necessary certainty on the stadium so the funding so the contribution that the cost share agreement guarantees given that interpretation is basically the minimum is the land only from government yeah it was the cauchy agreement and that does hit the laned in the lane does is separate to the either the 220 million or 're coming from you could see this in 3 million as a contribution from the crayon or you could see this 300 million is our contribution to the council and then the council contributes it to the stadium and basically they were saying if the private sector didn 't come to the party will to be determined it just said whatever to be determined means yeah and it was two hundred and sixteen million dollars to be determined if that if private sector funding couldn 't be obtained or the crown didn 't meet that 's half share with the council 's contribution being kept at 253 million the crown will amend of necessary the CCR P so it 's the Central City recovery plan that decides us to allow the council to build a 35,000 seat rectangular uncovered stadium on the site proposed under the CCR P the crown will contribute the land to the project with the CCC funding all other costs so the cost-sharing agreement is exactly as Andrews highlighted it says it 's only if they can 't find the private sector money then it will and just give us the land yep sorry Glen and then yani so thank you thank you Brennan just asking this question over against the backdrop of one of our aspirations which is 20,000 residents in the CBD so in terms of residential in a city living I recall the pre positive feasibility ruled out a configuration of a multi-use arena with hospital hospitality with hotels etc do you know whether any thoughts been given to residential on the same on the same site is is something which could be structured up financially actually to help such a big sort today end on expect the business case to reduce the range or the business case will come here the like I just wonder whether it came out in the previews a bloody know it but there 's the pre-feasibility is almost irrelevant at this stage as the it 's an allocation okay yeah yonni so I just wanted to check under 4.9 it says if cancer wishes to consider other projects for funding outside the scope of the stadium residential red zone and horizontal infrastructure then staff can provide further later point in time so can you just clarify what the process would be for example if we were wanting to approach this fund for social housing what the process would be sure so on the social housing one obviously you 've allocated 50 million and the establishment of the Housing Trust at five million dollar cash gift and 45 million capitalization in the 2018 LTP you allocated 30 million dollars that you earn our consulting heads arranged and so if you wanted instead of any of these projects to allocate further than the 80 million dollars to refurbishment to all development of new social housing that would be a measure for council and if the council decides that it doesn 't want to accept the sat voice and then staff could work on alternative a voice but that would be a metaphor counsel so the process would be to put a resolution to the meeting today to seek their advice and withhold some of the money it was meant of the resolution thank you thanks Ben I 'm just following the that Christian my understanding from the reports is 't include housing and that 's a separate matter have I I got that Creek that in fact we couldn 't apply for housing funding through this this capable acceleration phone so all of the public discourse both as Aaron Campbell recorded this morning from the Labour Party manifesto before it was own government and then from ministers and in articulating it pretty clearly in the paper has talked about that the purpose of this fund is to provide certainty in to accelerate and projects and the projects that the three projects that consistently in repeatedly mentioned are the stadium the residential read zone and in horizontal upper structure and so no one 's I don 't think I ever seed the things are out of scope or can 't_''_676.74 be funded and but I do come back to we would need to meet the purposes of the fund to provide certainty in to accelerate projects and that that follows discussions that senior staff in every head with a central government yes so the central government perspective is that the happy for us to make their proposals but as I and that they would need to ensure for the drawdown of government funding and they would want to make sure that there wasn 't any unintended precedent set that the purpose of this fund is for christchurch and in its to reflect the earthquakes and the consequences of the earthquakes inside leading up to draw clear links and to their what we 're seeking funding for and unfunded projects as a result of the earthquake legacy issues and is going to be critically important so I wouldn 't want to create a rod for own back and by by trying to be too tricky in terms of what we were seeking funding for the three projects that were proposed well lined up with the three criteria that have been frequently talked about thank you can you one question can you confirm that none of the three proposals make any difference to LTP allocation because they 're all additional funds coming in from central government to accelerate both the delivery of the stadium multi-use arena and transport infrastructure that wouldn 't have been done otherwise in residential breeds own funding we describe these is the 300 million dollar surge over and above the LTP so easier as you remember yet and LTP his 5.7 billion dollars worth of capital I think over the next 10 years and this is a 300 billion dollar surge investment and the decisions that are proposed here are consistent with the decisions that you made in the LTP specifically on the stadium where you agreed to bring forward the 253 million dollars by two years and you also acknowledged that the stadium and body purpose arena would be one of the first tours from the acceleration facility and you 've listed heavily in roading appears in the LTP including based on feedback from residents through that process and the 40 million dollars proposed here would be a surge to address those most affected areas over and above the investment that you 're making in the LTP and in your LTP you have approximate hundred forty million dollars for what works and the area of the reads on and including the soccerway Lane drainage works and bridge and and this proposal would be an addition to debt discussions with with others is this the fastest most expedient way of getting this money out of the government so these approaches so the yeasted is the most expedient way to get the money out of the government these three proposals line up with the statements that the mayor Prime Minister made when she was leader of the Labour Party they they line up with the budget documents that are that have been released they line up with their kind of criteria that have been talked about in the stadium horizontal infrastructure in the research read zone so we comes to providing Susan T and and us being able to spin the money the amis three of the fastest ones thank you um Yanni throughout I said several other questions one of why is this not being done as part of the cost share refresh the check me things like clarification around who 's paying for things like the stadium what he 's doing the stadium as you know I think it 's was talked about this morning and Erin 's do protection as well and this is part of the crown about into course but this is the first part this was announced as part of budget 2018 and if you want to move quickly on this then we 've given you some options today right and just the assessment that we we 've assessed that it should be bits of medium significance and it states that there 's being consultation through the LTP although specific projects and quantum of funding hasn 't been allocated from this fund why do we not consider this to be high significance in light of the submissions that we 've heard from people and the fact that there 's been no public there was no public engagement on the original cost share which has created this problem so just trying to understand how we get away from talking to our community about how this money should be allocated because it 's never being put in it it has no impact on the long term plan I mean that 's the that 's the actually the truth of it but here 's my own pick but I think it 's a grant from the that the paper oh I trust in hope is clear I 've tried to be very clear on the decision being sought from counsel today is for a proposal that will then go to and cabinet ministers to joint ministers at as stage one of a two-stage process and that proposal was in a paper are consistent with the feedback that you 've received notwithstanding that it wasn 't explicitly included in the consultation document but those ultimately your choices but also simply remind all councillors that the 253 million dollars from the stadium that there is still the council 's contribution has been an every and your plan and long-term plan since 2013 yes but what I 'm trying to understand given that there was no public consultation on the blueprint and there was no public consultation on the cost year why we can rely on the community engagement without the key financial information has been ok it just doesn 't I 'm just trying to understand how we come to that conclusion and there 's been no specific consultation about these projects from central government and we have we arrived here and we 've brought it forward and we did so explicitly and and the LTP and that was a decision that was supported by you know well let me rephrase it another way then in the final question is if we chose that this is of high significance and that we would like public consultation on how this money is allocated how long would that take and what 's the best way to do that I suspect and if you wanted to consult with the public on and the allocation of the 300 million dollars while we haven 't planed for that that would be a relatively time-consuming process including the consideration in particular of how you would deal with the feedback so the paper is clear that these aren 't the only worthy projects in the city here are a large range of worthy projects about to meet the criteria for the funding in to provide the certainty and acceleration and that these are the first three projects if the fund was far larger then there would be many other things that we 'd put in and it would delay being able to provide any certainty I 'm relatively sure that given the high level of interest and the matter that people will you know do ads sort of kind of an independent means and in statistically valid survey of public opinion on this issue but it is a it is a government ground it 's a government grant and it enables us to do the very thing that the government wanted which was momentum we can 't get the stadium finished we can 't get it started without knowing that the money is there but we 're not going to take any eye off the amount of money so if there are any savings to be made we want them off the 253 million so Italy and you also mentioned that in response to a counselor you Hinton 's question obviously regenerate Christchurch have released their outcomes of the public consultation just in the last week you know percentages are that 89% in sport and support or 91% in the sport of the green sport yeah but there was around 90 percent in support of and an attacking board proper surveying company likewise Europe received a huge amount of feedback and every time that we consult on any planes or long-term planes and fixing the roads and and this is proposing and it will generate more money this money because through every every dollar we put in I mean this fund put sun we put on money and and indeed ta put some money that 's right so in GTA in treasure of confirmed and that is a grant that the council 's contribution on the roads would be eligible subject to inclusion and the standard processes for the NZTA contributions as well we 're still trying to identify exactly what the contributions are they 've changed under their most recent initial Land Transport plan but we will be able to report back to you in due course once we 're at the business case stage we also know what projects we chose to spend it on on what the multiplier I think the dentist 's okay all right well we 'll open it up for debate and Tim thank you I 'll go first government for the stimulus and also the Minister for Christchurch dr. Megan woods without her pushing it through with support through cabinet I don 't think we 'd be having this debate which would be an absolute crime so to Megan and the Labour all the present government thank you very much just hopefully we will approve this today and if we do don 't don 't view the next stage of the process is focusing on a developing a robust in this investment case the investment case will also exert examine the economic and social benefits as well as the financial costs and that will lead into a business case so this is just a stiffens the process and hopefully a good process in a quick Procrit process because if we start laying investigation in 2019 we can start the build in 2021 with hopefully if completed in 2023 which will be huge stimulus to the central city we had mention of the the butcher the baker the candlestick maker and certain them in the bit streets because back in street etcetera there are family laundries which rely on are actually new New Zealanders they 're not in suits they 're not driving fancy cars and they 're certainly not on boards etc so it really is a lot of people will survive on this in aid stimulus to this we also heard that students and director people would be wonderful of all the students came to Christchurch well don 't kid yourself so they 're not going to because although people have a perception of students doing short stint of study in between drinking and partying they 're actually not they do not and cannot afford to leave University with crippling student debt so that 's why Wellington Auckland and Eden and Palmerston North etcetera are doing extremely well because of part-time jobs prior to the earthquake vbase which is the company that owned by the council who runs in our stadia etc and who brought you are the Foo Fighters Bruce Springsteen and who will be bringing you fill columns on the 4th of February Monday that 's Waitangi day get your tickets and support Christchurch gates before do you think you know just a brief like of students in the city and that 's why the Students Association the kenri University Association came to this council with a delegation to say please build this stadium so there are a lot of issues and I realize in our city but this is important years and years ago where you had dad that you 'd go down the fish-and-chip shop and there would be space invaders now you have a games a games do not function in an open environment they have to be in a roofed arena you have hundreds and millions of people online watching these with millions of dollars worth of prize money they are big and the future is amazing what what can happen with those we also have the opportunity to have it in the central city four hundred meters away from our main public transport terminus that 's outstanding and unique in New Zealand so there are just so many opportunities I do have word of caution though when we are started this journey it 's absolutely crucial for our central city and our businesses that we don 't end up like want I don 't see and how it can work if we have ha spoke and motels connected to the stadia so people do not go out and stimulate retail etc and the central city and other places and journey out for day trips etc it 's absolutely essential and one person that I think really kind of captured it was a young Lachlan John 's who came here hopefully you will all remember him he talked about the what can be in this multi-use arena with regards to the software now there 's a lot of work globally on defining your market so a for instance if your friends liked it you will like it so rather than sending emails out which everyone does people just switch off but when you 're going to these games now or concerts or whatever to be able to have your app to listen to a referees voice or an MCS voice or something like that to have that extra entertainment is absolutely crucial so I 'm going to fight you sir for this I think it 's well overdue and needed and the arena is probably the most contribution one of these three the other term really well supported through the through the long term plan consultation we had this year with grievances about their roads and the driver for the the green music residual weak zone so the arena is probably the most controversial one huh listening to the deputations this morning was very moving and we have probably a duty to support and almost honor these people have gone out on a limb and invested in our city this it 's called an acceleration fund but actually really it 's that to me it 's a get it done fund it 's we 've been waiting so long we 've got the the Metro Sports of spades in the ground for there the convention centers going up as we speak the Margaret Maggie playground was incredibly controversial especially the money that went into there but boy did that prove wrongness critics it 's worked it 's really really hook revitalize that part of turn affect the whole of the city so the only one legging here is the multi-use arena and listening to term the huge economic benefit this will be to the city and the huge revitalization and energizing of the central city which will emanate white out across the whole of Christchurch Canterbury and the South Island so you know we have to support the private sector here they 've gone out on a limb they 've invested and we also here that would certainty over and over again this will give a student it will give them certainty and encourage their investment to continue so we 've hit a steer from the government on this this is an incredible gesture from the government to offer this acceleration funding we 've hit a steer this is the preferred three items to to support today if we go in and try and muck around and offer different things and we 're only going to delay it and that certainly won 't be an acceleration funding so I say let 's let 's get this done let 's do this so are we supporting this today Andrew David Bell Glen thank you there have been a wide range of issues a high level relate to councils and residents priorities and the stadium obviously has been a subject of the discussion roading has the residential red zone has and and social housing and other social outcomes have as well and I 'd be extremely concerned if council had no strategy to get to good outcomes for all of these hugely important priorities so on housing I agree that this is a key priority that 's the reason why this council has been consulting on a proposed 30 million-dollar loads of äôt tahi Community Housing Trust which will allow for a hundred and eighty new warm dry homes to be built in a different environment council would be building those homes itself but we 're in the current government policy environment that we 're in which means that for the trust to build these houses is the most effective probably most cost-effective way to which his important outcome as quickly as possibly this will be a significant step towards bringing the numbers of social housing back to and in fact eventually beyond pre-earthquake levels it 'll replace 50 old and close old dollar capitalization of the trust also a big number this will be a catalyst for the building of more social housing what we 're talking about here is fit for purpose warm dry homes for those people that need them most so council hasn 't dropped the ball on social housing we 've actually got a plan to make life better for our existing tenants and for the new tenants who will populate those new houses and we know there 's a need out there on Rhoda this was a key priority for this council and the long-term plan and it remains a priority that 's why we 're proposing portioning 40 million of this funding to roading which of course will then attract the NZTA subsidy has been mentioned this morning to further increase the amount that we 're able to spend on roading none of these are small numbers and in fact the proposal is to focus the additional activity on the worst areas areas such as the east and Richmond but fundings only one of the constraints around roading the other constraint is capacity in that takes to be able to deliver and the capacity of residents to be able to bear huge numbers of concurrent roading project all at the same time and we 've seen that particularly in the central setting now the stadium this facility is referred to by some as a rugby stadium it needs to be much more than that if this was just about robbing I 'd find it really difficult to support but any stadium for Christchurch needs to be absolutely multi-use it needs to be designed to be used as many hours in the day as possible it needs to be designed to be used 365 days a year he needs to make sure that Christchurch is truly on the map as the capital of the South Island as the next obvious choice for concerts for events are the stuff that we haven 't even imagined yet and some of that just some of it will be rugby it 's clear that the cost-sharing agreement doesn 't guarantee a 50 government contribution and that was through the answers to my question this morning but um within that context 220 language and we 're fortunate to have a government and a minister in the form of Minister woods who 's seen the need for this total 300 million dollar contribution to Christchurch again these are big numbers as is the 253 million dollar rate payer contribution and I wish it was less but the reality is that what we 've got in front of us today is a 300 million dollar government contribution to Christchurch on the table this is the opportunity to provide certainty around a stadium if indeed we believe that Christchurch should have a stadium today is the opportunity to show certainty in that space as a sitting as the capital of the South Island we need to have fit for purpose infrastructure and fit for purpose services including key facilities including roading green space taking the opportunity the residential red zone presents adequate supply of good quality social housing and a vibrant economy not just in the central city but throughout the region one that sees this great city regenerated offering opportunity for everybody this conversation about a stadium has been going on for a long long and we need to make sure that we don 't complicate this so that we get the benefit of the funds that we 're able to benefit from and that certainty be provided quickly and at the same time we need to make sure that we find the balance and that we 're able to address all of our areas of priority as I 've discussed them this morning so we now need to do what the people of Christchurch elected us to do we need to consider the issues we need to find the balance we need to show leadership we need to make the hard decisions and we need to provide certain thing not only for the stadium but for the other issues that have quite rightly been raised our support progress our support opportunity for everybody I support a good opportunity for this city and that 's the reason I 'll be supporting this before thank you David um thank you I 'll be brief I 'm going to support this resolution today and I think my prime reasons for supporting it have been well presented investment and the flow-on effects that this sort of projects will have which will then provide more money for Council to do things ultimately it 's not a contingent estable fund and I think what was I 'd be putting a plug in for a few things in the and and Andrew and others have clearly indicated the concerns that some people have around should we be investing in some of their housing issues and this council clearly is taking a step to address those sort of issues through other funding and support for a number of other initiatives so I will support it I think it 's great for Christchurch and let 's do this Phil thank you and I think staff will work that has been done on this and I think it 's a very clear report with all of the issues and I get I guess this whole debate around whether or not to the stadiums that really started back at the time of Sheeran idea when there was a huge consultation and people said they certainly wanted a sports and and social arena to be we know it started off also with as being part of the cost share agreement and I actually believe that at this point if seven years down the track if we don 't actually make a clear decision today Christchurch never will so I think it 's really important that we get to grips with us there 's no question that the the stadium at Eddington it was a temporary stadium it is already costing a large amount of money to maintain into sustained and and that we as a city we 're not able to continue having having it as a sports or a concert arena so and today the Chamber of Commerce they confirmed that in fact our city really is at a tipping point in terms of the need for businesses to be supported in development and that to me that whole area of the need for people to be involved in their city and to be employed in the construction of these major projects is really really important and clearly though as has been said this is a government grant and it came clearly from the clear about the purposes for this acceleration fund then it was a round quest Church needing certainty and that some speakers have already referred to that and I think that 's really a central thrust keep in mind today I think that the whole area that has been discussed around affordable housing and social housing that is really important and I 'm short councillor Livingston have something to say about that and it 's quite clear though that this fund is really that social housing affordable housing doesn 't fit this fund in terms of the government 's intentions but I think it 's really important that as a council in the fitt we continue to consider looking at additional funding for social housing and in addition to what has already been decided on in a long-term plan and des some counselor Turner seed which we are going out for consultation on right now thirty million dollars there 's no small amount so I think it 's quite clear that the stadium in terms of its potential for business attraction if a development of our central city is essential in current with social housing projects okay Glen I think you me as someone asked me at morning tea and the and the bathroom how 's it going to go today and my response was we 'll be gamed if we do and damned if we don 't which we will leave so I 've looked at social housing our wait list figures that latest data at the end of June 579 waiting for a social housing unit that wetness to shared across all the community housing providers in Christchurch a big chunk of which is housing New Zealand 's big chunk of witches council through the auto taki Community Housing Trust and there are other providers I have n thank you for the lobbying it 's all a good part of the democratic process there 's the signs you 're being here the emails etc I 've looked at this in terms of say we loaded 300 million front-loaded that today into the council accounts we build with the demanders one to two bedroom units that say 150 each very cheap build at scale economies of scale is 2,000 units lost we know about the approaching demand but for me a question is can you could you actually built 2,000 social housing units in one year at the rate of 5.4 a day we could deliver the consents my colleague Andrew Turner talked about capacity before on capacity and deliverability we all know as councillors that throwing more money at something actually doesn 't speed it up you can allocate more in a budget but it won 't deliver it faster and that 's to do with capacity and deliverability so we persisted with the idea the dollars were required to meet the 400 gap at 150,000 each that comes to 60 million we 've just approved a loan of half that amount being 30 and we 're going through the prices of the sign off that 's 200 a year and then next year my intention is will do we will undertake another loan and we 'll keep going until we 've not only built back but we 're continuing to build for the future my view is that housing is a system and loading up social housing and where it acts as an art so for those homeless we have 200 and the four heirs of many more in the wider community but I do not have a sense that we have 400 let alone 2000 we could usher a rallying call all builders to build social housing would they do it no the business proposition wouldn 't be there they 'll do some but they make their money in high-end mid-market and affordable we remain committed to social housing along with our ta partners and we 're going to put the pressure on them to contribute as well 500 million scoot money in the east of Christchurch hasn 't finished the jobs the job the roads aren 't as good as in the West 10300 many 300 million crown money and social housing now wouldn 't speed up the task either so today our task is to leverage out what we have as best we can and that 's what we 're going to do Thank You Jaime I 'm very supportive all the recommendations that we have in front of us I 'll be supporting them of the importance for investment in their horizontal infrastructure we 're well aware of the opportunity there is a residential red zone presents for us in Christchurch and we 've had 253 million on budget for a multi-purpose arena since 2003 we have set through many rounds of consultations on this topic we know how important it is to 2013 yeah you can quantify things in dollar terms they 're right in front of us there but what you can 't often quantify is the value that certainty brings the certainty that we will give Christchurch from this decision today particularly around the stadium cannot be underestimated its enormous and it will help define Christchurch for the better a closed roof multi-purpose arena is not a nice-to-have it 's essential if we 're to be taken seriously as a city and will be an iconic community facility in a cornerstone for entertainment and economic benefit to our region for the next 50 plus years the fact of the matter is and although we like to think it at times it 's not really us with council the crown that are investment we play our part but our role in us as doctors a catalyst and to provide leadership and certainty it 's the private sector that do the rest and without them we don 't have a rebuild and this is what this is all about today the private sector has held up their end of the bargain now it 's now it 's our turn my only regret is that we haven 't been able to do this sooner we have had an opportunity to give we have an opportunity today to give certainty and I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that providing certainty around this today would be a decision that history judge judges favorably so today we will drag the chain no longer because as we 've heard earlier today the multi-purpose arena is something that we cannot afford not to do Mike thank you I guess I 'm gonna echo a lot of what has already been said by my fellow councillors which I guess there 's a clear signal that this council is united and committed to ensuring that we have a vibrant has already occurred on the back of the many anchor projects for Christchurch and not coincident today would be a disservice to those that have invested in our city the Maldives arena along with the other major projects will create employment and growth growth that I actually help keep race leader sustainable level I just want to quickly touch on the transport because actually I think this is a very significant investment we know our roads are damaged and we know this impact the impact this has on the many people their well-being endless was heard loud and clear during the long term plan process the 40 million dollar request actually has the ability with the new insight a financial assistant rates coming soon to actually increase that up to nearly a hundred million dollars so there 's a mess of significant investment and transport infrastructure in our city dionan in Erin I just wanted to say thank you to the government as well for 300 million dollars that we 're discussing today it 's um it 's nice to have I would have liked to have refs 1 billion what we can at the moment where we will still be working on the Akashi wrap up I hope and but anyway it sounds like this is this is going well which is great I think this gives certainty is everybody keeps saying in the context of the paper that we 're going to be discussing after this actually this is very important and it would have been nice to discuss that first and then we can say well we walk in our talk because the central city momentum papers that we 're going to be discussing soon it does paint a little bit of a grim picture about where our central cities at at the moment but we have a chance to actually start turning that around in the work the paper that 's coming up next is going to spell out how we can turn this around and by walking the talk today actually voting for the the capital acceleration fund especially for the stadium multi-purpose arena will actually provide that certainty for that investment community that 's out there looking for opportunities in our city the city the economic prosperity in our central city that paper says we need 15,000 more people working in the central city that 's actually will just bring it up to what it was before the earthquake and we 've heard from the Chamber of Commerce that the multi-purpose ER and it will provide jobs it won 't just provide jobs when the multi-purpose arena is actually built but as the construction industry winds up and starts to slow down at the tail end of the rebuild the actual construction of this thing is actually going to provide a lot of jobs for people that create certainty for businesses in the Central City as we start transitioning to our new economy which I hope we will start to look at in the in the future paper that 's coming up next because there is a lot of work that as a city we need to do that but as Mike was saying there the one thing that I 'm very very excited about actually is and the thing that actually the City Council we need to get on top of is the that deteriorate over year over the years because we 're only replacing 2% of their infrastructure every year every year that 's not good enough now getting up to a hundred million dollars with this well as was said because of the match funding will actually make a massive difference and actually that will lift the spirits of our people in our city a lot more than in many other of the spinned that will be going on but so this is really good residential redzone are very happy with the the money go into that as well because we do need to start thinking about that opportunity for our city and just one last thing I do hope with the stadium conversation multi-purpose arena conversation that we actually will start still looking for other opportunities for funding and we could sell the naming rights to the firm to the stadium you know those kind of opportunities are going to come which can come off the total cost of this thing and give money back to the to the ratepayers there so we can actually do this for other initiatives being said there but also wanted to say thank you to the people that have come in here today the business community and the people up there we do hear what you 're saying but there are other mechanisms mechanisms that we are to deliver the social housing Thank You Aaron yeah a lot of things have been covered off so I 'll try not to touch on any of those and I 'll talk about inspirations and disappointments in this and how small amount of money 300 million dollars suddenly sounds and post-quake Christchurch which is kind of kind of just so so weird I 'm not really in favor of sea but I 'll go along with it because all my colleagues are I don 't believe we should be taking on the residential red zone and I think it 'll be a noose around our neck that we can 't afford but it 's stunning it 'll make a great National Park and I wish we weren 't spinning any other money on it but that aside it looks great from the Year at the moment and there is five percent of the cost of that green spine it 's a phenomenal amount of money and then the other one the transport network and and we built back our roads pretty averagely to be honest if you no one has ever been overseas you 'll know how terrible wells are and sorry ok and thanks Neil and the transport network obviously you know the melon effect could go over to the west to fix a set of traffic lights and then the multi-purpose arena I 'll just touch on this because the blueprint came out and it did grab onto a lot of aspirations our city head and a lot of dreams it 's taken way too long man this rebuild slow in 1906 when San Francisco had a population just over 20 percent bigger than ours they had a quake and they rebuilt in 9 years and they had way more to rebuild they lost 28,000 buildings had 3,000 people killed and their City Hall they rebuilt which is 45,000 square meters but just pales anything we 're doing in comparison and they didn 't have 't have power talks something 's gone wrong in the last hundred years is we 've got all this technology everything costs way more to deliver and takes way longer so there 's this thing called process which seems to cost us a lot of time and cost us a lot of money because the guys on the Hammers at the tail end still generally and the lower paid part of our society and are still the ones putting up the buildings all the guys on shovels and diggers fixing the roads it 's it 's a strange outcome of the last hundred years but it 's it 's we 're at and this stadium will be open 14 years after the quake and quite started and that 's a little unacceptable for me the costs are high hopefully we 'll find some savings in there I 've just touched on one other point and that was raised this morning around the social housing and there 's someone that lived in social housing for five years of the formative years of their life and then comparing that to the stadium to concerts and you go to events and you go to sports events and hopefully if you 're lucky enough you 'll be one of the ones performing in there but as a child you don 't aspire to live in social housing you aspire to visit a stadium and it 's a strange strange situation for having the two in the same debate because they 're quite different subjects I look forward to the delivery of our social housing going forward for those that can 't sort out their own housing or need a little help for a portion of their life and I 'll finally finish on together let 's do this and make Christchurch great again Jonnie thank you thank you I think it 's really obvious from the dedications we 've heard this morning that this is a matter of high significance people actually want to have their say on this and if you go back through history it 's very easy to look at one of the huge dilemmas with the blueprint and that is there was no public consultation on the blueprint at all on top of what the people in Christchurch had done through sharing idea if you go to the Kostya agreement which set up probably the biggest funding agreement that the city has ever done with central government you find that that was done in secret with no public consultation at all so it 's very disappointing to see that where we 've got an opportunity to work with central government over future and the funding that once again there is no public consultation around how that money should be spent I have a lot of sympathy for the people that have come in to here today to say that their expectation was when this funding was announced that it was up to the people of Christchurch to decide if you look back at share an idea you see very clearly that the stadium did not get a lot of mentions in fact people and green spaces were at the heart of Charon idea we do know that social housing is not being fixed as fast as people would like part of the issue is that we had a housing accord out 70 million dollars and changed the conditions of the income related rent subsidy to mean that we were in a worse off position for housing but social and affordable inner city I think it is more than appropriate to ask them to honor the housing Accord and put some money towards helping us deal with the impact of social housing if you go back again to the Central City plan that we did as council they share an idea with huge citizen participation social housing in the inner city was seen as a key objective to rebuild and increase social housing in our inner city that has not happened today I just want to go through and say one of the really important things is that we miss synergy in our city I agree with Dion in regards to the idea that we should have to regenerate Christchurch review of the blueprint before we making decisions about how to spend money what we can see quite clearly is that people were over-promised and under-delivered and I think that is because the city a size of Christchurch it is simply government did and reallocate them on top of private land that increase the cost of the Central City recovery from about eight hundred million to two billion and that is why things have been slow because we simply cannot afford to have brand-new projects done in isolation okay so finally I just say I like to move an amendment that we publicly consult on the capital acceleration fund this is endorsed by the recent surveys both through quality of life and the resident survey that show that people 's what do you mean it 's not too late just an amendment at the beginning I 'm sorry it was moved and seconded and we entered debate you can 't_''_3294.27 move an amendment partway through the the process after you 've already spoken you should nobody 's got an opportunity to speak to the amendment I mean it 's you can 't do it it 's just not with understanding waters in which you stand up and please advise us the standing orders thank you and the next speaker is Bucky back thank you and it 's great to hear the morning I think we have that the overwhelming submission that I 've had from people on this is could you just do it and and just make it happen because we are so sick of waiting and we want speed and certainty and that 's not just from the business community we have a current stadium which has just a stadium that is fast nearing the end of its viable life and whatever we do we are going to have to do something different in relation to multi-use arena and I hate seeing people leave Christchurch for Auckland or Dunedin for the weekend it irritates me intensely but I envisage a type of multi-use arena very similar to the one that that Richard people 's outlined but even more so there as sports fine but I see this more as a games as concerts as all sorts of things that bring us together as people and I see it as school events young people events university games all sorts of things that mean that the to you Serena is used all the time we are all going to pay for have a very democratic approach to how it 's used and it doesn 't need to have high entry costs in terms of the transport I love the fact that attracts years another subsidy from government I think that 's great we heard a huge amount of input at the long term plan which was only if some weeks ago in terms of people wanting more in that field so and I think the way it much has been allocated around the world suggested to be allocated around the city is great in terms of the red zone I actually think that 's a stunning asset for this city I think it 's one of the huge opportunities that 's come out of a huge disaster and I think what will happen in that red zone or green zone or whatever it becomes that incredible ecological environmental area will just be amazing so I think it 's fantastic that we 're actually allocating some money to do some things in there and there is still seventeen and a half million extra as well sitting in the DIA fund that has this now actually I think we do just need to get on with it I think people are really really sick of waiting for things in Christchurch they want some speed they want some certainty and they want us just to get on and do this we heard from the University of Canterbury Students Association actually how much they wanted excitement and things to go to when they came here and we heard how many students were now moving to Christchurch because they couldn 't afford the rents in Wellington and Auckland and that was actually a huge increase they 've just had a dramatic increase in their July intake we want to continue that traumatic increase for education opportunities across the city but they need things that attract people to all sorts of events and they they asked us at the time of the long term plan please could you get a multi-use arena so that we don 't have to go elsewhere to go to concerts so I think this is great that the council is so United about making the and that we 're going to make apartment is a council proposed strategic framework just want to reminder how the mayor council particularly focus on vision or committee outcome and the strategic priorities like a vision the coaches a city of opportunity for all open to new ideas new people new ways of doing things or city where anything is possible but how to make it happen to make them successful so I will be like um the outcome it looks like energy regarding to how does three hundred million dollars whether is compliant with this become the Hawkeye strong community livable city healthy environment and prosperous economy it looks like a registry of land livable city healthy environment and prosperity currently only the strong community men we need to consider you know maybe have any alternative way can give the the people give the rest and more confidence the HIV comes on their behalf maybe polish tomb at least the food and other recommendation and also this is only the proposal where or where actually finally sphere on the founder him but you know speaking as the cancer of the space you follows the city where reasonable because we heard so many some issues and this morning HSN transitional only for this local city only there is an aged nation where Salinas international city we always mention rely to attractive people to come here to waste a year to live here to walk here to investment here for how do we to create more opportunity to attract him but this one is facially we wear those hum 3,000,000 was our last discernment for this asleep ethical new multi-use arena and also so wrong to the kind of infrastructure as well as on the area this L okay already but teacher we 're not gonna start we mentioned earlier still under the the one when they are true therefore each schedule we still you know need to study more in their time still go to the party consultation we take from the people a seat or so these are principal so I supported these okay there is almost exactly three minutes on impressed and I 'm totally supportive of this decision today this decision provides certainty and accelerates progress for us at ease development these projects closely and they are consistent with the council 's decision that is PO the LTP process but more importantly this decision provides hope hope for SATs businesses need this residents need this both are current in our future residents our region need this particularly multi-use arena and we need to know that going forward we have hope for our economy hope for the well-being of our city hope for its vibrancy I am satisfied that our city as well as putting money into these projects is also caring for those who need housing we have eighty million dollars committed to that at the moment as well as many other initiatives that address the inequity in our city so I 'm totally supportive of I 'm excited about it we 're all tired of making that trip down to Dunedin so let 's get on with that thank you well I just um just say a quick word and you know hand over to erect close the debate you know I 'm on the record historically as having a very strong view with how the blueprint was processed and developed and I fully engaged in that process and they wound but what the government of the day did was that they wrote it into our district plan and they put allocations against particular sites for particular projects and there is a site that has been set aside in the central city for a multi-use arena it 's been established in the district plan that that is what it is for and at the point that we 're at now we have business people and their employees and I think we forget that they employ a large number of people who also pay rates in our city and they absolutely have made their commitment they have made their investments knowing that there would be a multi-use arena built on that site there have been a lot of international debates about convention centers and stadia and whether they do activate and whether they do act as a catalyst for a city 's creation but never anywhere can I find an example of something that is right in the heart of the CBD nothing of that scale right and close to the CBD and so we heard today that they could have picked up the insurance settlement and walked away but they chose to invest in the city and they did so on the basis that their own land had been taken from them by central government on the basis that these particular assets would be developed and what the government 's announcement of the 300 million dollar capital regeneration acceleration fund what that did was give us as a city the opportunity to provide the missing link and that was for the stadium to actually the multi-use arena to actually be completed so I agree with the statement that was made today this is something that whose time has come we have to make a decision in order to progress things and I 'm supporting the resolution today ref thank you we can 't change the past but we can create the future and I think this is the opportunity in front of us today I think with all that sort of reasons to supporters have been world covered but really what this does is it ends one of the most intractable problems we blueprint which is this huge funding gap for this asset I had many conversations with the previous Prime Minister and the previous previous Prime Minister telling them to just fund this gap that 's what they should have done in the first place they didn 't and that 's why we 're here today and I said in the end government will always end up funding this gap because the private sector simply isn 't going to take on such a risky proposition and that 's the reality of a post is asked to rebuild the public sector picks up the slack together with the private sector what 's been slightly different in this post disaster disaster reconstruction is how the private sector has actually invested ahead of the public sector and the public sector does have a duty to finish the job last year I think is DeLand mentioned in the election I put this on the table 200 million dollars for the stadium and we 're lucky that both parties responded to that national put forward a bid for 120 million dollars to the stadium labour came with that they are in government because it 's a bigger number and they should be congratulated for that because we 've got to finish the job and I think there was a realization that this money was only going to come from central government ultimately it was their plan in the beginning this will be an incredible asset for the city like the new Central Library which looks stunning the Metro Sports Center the Convention Center and the incredible Town Hall Christchurch is going to be the place to live in the city and this is the final piece of very very complicated jigsaw that we now need to put into place and as Richard said this is where the rubber hits the road this is our decision at some point we got to make the decision and we 've got to make it today the Minister for Christchurch regeneration is very supportive of this in the house last week on the anniversary of the 4th September anniversary she was very clear about progressing the final business case on the stadium doing the global settlement and finishing the job I we need to finish the job so let 's finish it off thank you I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much you get Yanni this yep the only place yeah yeah alright so we 're going to adjourn now for the lunch break for those that want to go downstairs there 's a presentation happening for the the young people were gathering at with the the strategic plan strategic priorities on the strategic priorities you 're welcome to go and but I 'm going to a joint June the meeting until so I 'd say 130 yeah one beauty and that just gives everyone an opportunity to get things done all right one thing thank you _"

and all go around click me correct thank you very much thanks right now the next one is Warrick Shafer representing classic coastal residents unites presenting a deputation on item nine notice promotion I 'm just waiting for their yeah you 're not gonna be able to stay are you for the discussion on the because I was I 'm gonna defer the item to later on this afternoon to go yeah so that that 's okay yeah it will be online to correct a problem in the district plan and want to just explain a little bit of background behind there in to beseech you all to please support it because correcting this thing is the right thing to do and you been saving a lot of people from a lot of angst and grief that we 've had because of this to this point so are probably very familiar with what 's happened here I 've been asked to practice give a little bit of background for those that are on the other side of town and maybe this is not so familiar I guess every part of town has its huge problems I understand your kisses are already gobbling it up this is our huge problem on the coastal side of town and if you can relate it to something that 's a big issue for you that 's to do with coastal hazards it goes right back to the beginning of the coastal hazards process where there were three hazards inundation erosion and flooding you may remember a big thing a few years ago where that was taken out of the fast-track process the community opposed it on the grounds that fast track was all about there 's quite related issues whereas this was global warming it 's a long onset issue we have time to think about it and do it right so those provisions were taken out a fast track where there 's not much time to think about things and was flooding and there is some argument to say that flooding should have stayed post-earthquake rivers have changed and so forth and there I think arguably is reason to quickly deal with some of those issues but unfortunately the serial the level rise component was left in with there also so the council proposed their building should be not applied in all these areas that would be flooding plus a meter of sea level rise that covered an enormous area of the city and non-compliance you say these planning terms quickly it 's hard to sort of understand what that really means on the ground I think it 's it 's one of those technical terms and doesn 't mean much but really I think just sort of paint the picture for you you look at a suburb or a house that 's a bit small you 're a young family you have a dream of maybe adding a room for your child that 's not possible when building is not non compliant you can 't extend your house or we might find a section that 's not possible and but it ripples out through an entire suburb you know as a suburb that has a sort of a policy like this on it is really you know you can 't invest in a suburb that can 't_''_734.35 be invested and can 't grow it 's there 's only one direction for us it 's extremely severe and we 're starting to see they 're not on right and South Shore now where this has progressed further than anywhere else it 's it 's it 's a very severe and quite ugly thing in the stories we 've had to sit and listen to of severe some people twenty thirty thousand dollars just gone that 'll never come back just trying to get through planning to build a house it they cannot actually build because of this mistake in the plan so the map up here is what 's called the residential unit overlay these little speckles of yellow there was a process through the fast-track called independent Hearing Panel now are you people here probably know what that 's all about but essentially for everyone else it 's a process that we all went through where the council put their best experts their best lawyers all the evidence supporting the idea that building should be non-compliant in these areas we came we put opposing evidence to the panel which was this is too harsh there are too many uncertainties the costs are too high there are better ways and the Pennell listened to that and asked the council to go away and draw up some new rules which called restricted discretionary so you can build under certain heavier certain things if that preserved life and limb and property to tick these things off you 're able to build your house and the council the panel itself didn 't have really a drafting service so they asked the council to do it and this is a sort of see here we go here was this on the hub yep so the council was asked to act as a drafting service for the panel which was essentially to draw up this restrictive discretionary area and they did it in areas that would be only afflicted affected by sea level rise so only be at flood risk at some point long time into the future if these scenarios come through there 's so many ifs right now there was high and dry you 're quite safe to build a house there right now so they 've drafted these plans and the council did it under duress because this is not what the council wanted at the time and so they said you should follow the panel 's instructions and then have a chat then you would have a chance at the end to voice their concerns through policy riders so they can make that clear so that was the process now the next slide is shows the result of their and we 're some things have somehow gone wrong a little bit now we 're asking that there be an inquiry into how this happen because actually it 's not 100% sure what 's gone wrong here we know it 's wrong because recently a letter came out from the judge who was cheering that panel saying what it is like now is not how we intended it so just to take I 'll read it up to you on the version put to the ihp by that CCC at the hearing so this is the vision written under juries to allow building in these areas a provide for development for a residential unit on residentially zoned land we appropriately education can be provided that protects people 's safety well-being and property and in all other cases avoid subdivision etc no that 's the right service but the council 's position at the time they 're possibly Stella 's was that they didn 't want that they didn 't want building so they had their own version which was is on the left here which doesn 't have this provision about residential provide for residential development and this I wonder stress that that 's not wrong of course they have their position and the problem that has happened somehow as the council 's position got into the final version and the panel wasn 't how can I say not notified or didn 't notice of something went wrong that the wrong version went into the plan those wanted the left-hand version here who always see is a void development when they look at the plan and effectively you 've got the result of what was originally wanted which was non-compliance now it was it completely certain up until recently that this was a problem the council starts as well the payment would have noticed they must have published this they must have wanted it a leader has come out from the judge hessen Hinson sorry saying this is not our intention we absolutely intended this residential discretionary part to go in the actual rule that we in turn the max winter it 's just this policy but there 's three lines that got missed out and I have the rule actually on the next slide just to show you if you click to their read it out to it it 's going to say that the rule itself is in the play it 's just completely incongruous that you would have no policy that would actually it 's obviously wrong even before we got the letter from the judge but that just cements it so Yanni 's motion today is about starting government through section 17 we 're not quite sure yet but we need to urgently fix it there 's been a thorough time this whole process for council for community for stuff I think everybody involved is up to here with coastal hazards and I 'm really hoping that this could be a turning point to doing things you just come perfectly to the end of the ten minutes that was allocated last night I thought you didn 't think that you would be able to to fill on ten minutes but you have admirably and I 'm glad you have written on the rule I 'm glad you 've identified the problem very clearly which is does the policy support the rule that was clearly decided by the independent hearings panel and I think when we get to Yanni 's notice of motion later on today we 'll be able to but I can I reassure you that we this isn 't the start of the process we 've been on to this and I have to say the release of the judges letter has actually enabled me to 's happened and now we need to focus on fixing it so thank you very much for your presentation today okay thank you so we 'll move on to the the next set of public deputations the first of which as Aaron Campbell on council priorities for capital acceleration fund item 24 [Music] their errands the supporting documents on the hub if you want to follow that right now good morning Council hey aha tell me a newie hotel today I 'll focus on three things in this deputation it 's on the Christchurch regeneration acceleration facility luckily it 's not called a plan because it wouldn 't be a craft anymore it would be something else one the first thing that I 'll focus on is council process the second thing is attachment B which is my kind of supportive documentation the third is a comparison of options based on the four well beings that you 've been presented as a council but before I begin on that I want to draw your attention to schedule five paragraph a of the cost-sharing agreement that was signed in 2013 and fifty-fifty the CRA the CSA it was the one that had a two hundred and sixteen million dollars to be determined that 's correct yes with private sector funding and or 50 crown CCC contribution up for the balance the CCC 's contribution will be encamped at 253 but coming back to the agenda item 24 today in August of 2017 this is what Canterbury heard the council has just submitted just consulted on its LTP the consult a consultation document said that the capital acceleration facility has not been included in the LTP and at the time of printed also quotes the government is reviewing Metro sports and the stadium and again this is not factored into the plan in the agenda item and significance 2.1 point to the proposals of in this paper were not explicitly part of the 2018 LTP consultation key points for point three the crown has been consistent that appropriate due process for allocation of crown funding should be followed that 's supported with Note 3 Note 3 Note 3 links to Minister dr. Megan woods in May of this year quote local decision-makers best for Christchurch my primary question to you today is are you adhering to the Local Government Act are the principles of consultation if you move this agenda item today is council going to be responsible for any cost overruns because there 's no longer a partnership with the crown the second point that I want to bring up today is attachment B of the craft stadium proposal so let 's the cost elements of three options and as we know the pre-feasibility study of the multi-use arena that was released in August of 2017 had four options so what three are we talking about here thankfully Michael he would have VFX yesterday shed some light on that so option three here is now the same as option 3 and the pre-feasibility study now option 3 has been a hot choice all year from my understanding however a general manager is quoted in this article saying now option 2 is the preferred choice so we 've happened here council is now saying that you want a clone of Forsyth Barr there 's no retractable pitch there 's no 100% natural my question is how was this decided and the attachment I want you to draw at your attention so this is the supporting documentation it 's on page 2 the significant challenges to achieving financial viability of stadiums now refer to page 2 on funding options this concludes in the pre-feasibility study the risks of debt funding the risks of pre-sales as a funding option and private sector interest and investment and development risk for the council as the precinct owner now let me be clear Christchurch needs a new stadium but the process has to be in the process has to be correct we do need a new stadium but the process has to be correct the third and final point that I want to raise is the options that you have had that you have in front of you here today the attack or even River corridor the green spine is half of the 600 hectare residential red zone it 's an 800 million dollar project it says in the documents here today that the economic benefits are 2.9 billion dollars there 's a increase in private property 4,000 homes there 's going to be a million unique visitors supporting the regeneration of East Christchurch and to quote to realize these and other environmental cultural and community benefits effective delivery of the plan will be crucial and specifically ensuring that there is sufficient funding in the early stages particularly for the green spine but you 're saying here today and these documents will count or staff are bringing the the agenda to you today saying that 13% of the CRA if is all it 's worth right now how does that balance with the four well-beings hey aha Tim me a newie OTL Mac ooh hey ooh hey tangata thank you thanks for that Aaron um I 'm just looking at the Labor Party 's website and their policy on Christchurch and the 300 million capital acceleration fund specifically mentions there it 's the red zone contribute towards the new stadium and deal with gaps and the horrible horizontal infrastructure as part of the global sediments so there 's obviously two things that they 're they 're demeaning there but they specifically to spelling out the things that what was said in what 's actually the policy so tell Wellington that this is Christchurch and that we want to decide what we want to spend this money they promised and also there 's a hundred billion dollars there for around public transport as well thank you good morning and now I 'm at the moment um my name 's Richard Peebles and I 'm visiting in Christchurch at the moment building the Farmers Market in case your mall the Guthrie center beside Ballantine 's we 're actually doing eight heritage buildings beside the McKenzie and Willis development and High Street we 've invested heavily in Christchurch and the reason I invested heavily in Christchurch has despite that when they announced that the blueprint and seized half my lane I actually believed in that in the blueprint and then and you know the dream I was sold the dream with the anchor projects and that sort of thing and I could see a city that was going to be the best City you know in the world you know a brand new city and set out with all of about the anchor projects we have the you know we have the Convention Center the Avenue Eva precinct which i think is an amazing amazing Inca project and the laneways and and that sort of thing but from my from my point of view the most critical one that could want the most critical one is a multi-purpose arena now we 've got an incredible opportunity we 've been gifted land in the city to build a multi-purpose arena and we 've been given money to do it you know you don 't get that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build them I would say the best multi-purpose arena probably in the southern hemisphere right in the CBD connected by laneways and walkways to the terraced had said a little high all these things you know and I understand you know that the pressures and people wanting the money to be spent on other things but basically we must have a vibrant CBD you know who pays for all the roads and all all the all the infrastructure it 's a vibrant CBD the the rates the way you rights than doing residential if you don 't have a vibrant CBD you will not have the money to pay for the water to pay for the roads you know the key thing is we need our engine we running smoothly and we need it running well and our cvd is that engine in what 's happening at the moment is we 've got a we 're at a very very delicate stage in the rebuild you know we 've got a lot of good things happening the library and the Convention Center and I think the young witch cinemas opening very soon you know farmers markets gonna open in June a few delays I 'm sorry but that consent issues for anyway you know so we 've got lots of good things happening but the problem is and I just want to talk about the Dunedin Stadium you know the Dunedin stone I spent two hundred and twenty million I hear people talk about how you know it 's a noose around the neck of Dunedin and and that sort of thing you know it pays two million a economy 165 million and that 's six years after it was built you know if that 's a disaster can I have some of that you know seriously I just don 't understand how anyone can say that it hasn 't been successful now and the each year in concerts that we had over Easter you know 35,000 Christchurch residents left town 35,000 people now that the researchers at least been between 500 and 600 dollars each so they spent 18 million dollars of the money that was earned in crisis and they spent led in Dunedin the pink concert last week in you know if you own those same ratios it 's 10 to 12,000 Christchurch residents left to go to pink you know that 's another six million dollars we can 't afford every time there 's a big concert in Auckland or demeaning to have everyone leave town and spend a little money we can 't afford it people talk about whether we can afford the stadium we can 't afford not to build a stadium if you don 't know this multi-purpose arena in the CBD cafes and retail things closing now I deal with I deal with international retail tenants all the time you know and one of the major questions they ask me every time is what are our tourist drivers you know what 's bringing people into crushes I can tell them that our busiest days at the airport is when people are leaving town their busiest days of the airport when he 's a big concert demand big how do I tell these retailers that yeast coming and spending a million dollars on fed out and set up a Louis Vuitton on this amendment and the high street when they know very well we don 't have the tourist drivers this one one venue will change that you know the SPARC Arena in Auckland has I think last year seventy seven events similarly similar minutes I went to Robbie Williams concert my partner booked a hotel there was six six or seven hundred dollars so you 've got to be joking there must be cheaper accommodation than there I went on that trivago and looked for accommodation and this I went two 's because of the demand well you know we can get you can get a hotel room in Christchurch for under 200 that 's an indictment on the fact that we not we don 't have enough things happening here we 've got to have this Stadium OPP person arena you know the events this year that we could have had you know each year and paint Katy Perry Robbie Williams Bruno Mars James Blunt imagine dragons Jimmy Manchu Celine Dion Adele Shania Twain Macklemore Neil Diamond tip it just goes on and then you have and then you have the Warriors and the Phoenix and all that sort of thing you know people talk about any wreckage they 've charged me mad it 's not a rugby stadium it 's a multi-purpose arena the biggest impact will be from the concerts and the events and if you talk about the you took about I 've got young kids and my young kids they want to go to Dunedin they want to go to Wellington to go to Auckland we need our city do we attract other young kids and best concert venue in the country and we can do that we 've been given the land we 've got the money you know we need to do that I want my kids to go to Canterbury very selfish but imagine if everyone 's kids wanted to come to Canada maybe have people imagine that people from other centers willing to see in their kids to go to Canterbury University it 's almost unheard of everyone watch to go everywhere else you know the cost of the Dunedin Stemmons turned twenty million but the one thing I 'd you know the we spectra stadium they built the stadium and I think was 2000 was a hundred million but the thing is that stadium now is effectively obsolete because it doesn 't ever so we 've got the opportunity to build this amazing venue right under the CBD and it 's not about if we can afford it I would be asking the question can we afford not to do it because we don 't do it the taxi drivers the dairy owners the retailer 's the hospital is going to Dunedin and I heard someone sets an arms race and well you know it is and we 're losing were unarmed and we can 't afford not to have this Stadium you know and I do appreciate you know the issues with the roading and all that sort of thing and you know I 've got my own theories about the priorities and things about where we should be spending our money I see money spent on things every day which I go what the hell are we doing but that 's another argument but the this the multi-purpose arena is essential infrastructure we must have mass terrorists not a want and if I hear it someone else sets a rugby stadium I 'll go absolutely mad you know we do have 19 rugby games but if we have 20 concerts and I know this I 've spoken to the people that organize these concerts I asked them about the pressures and a competition to get these concerts we will have the best venue we will get them and I know the guys that the promoters are saying will we big event in that Stadium you imagine 30,000 people every week coming into the city spending at 6 and 18 million dollars in the economy every week will have money for the rides will have money for the pools will they have money for everything else we want because a vibrant city will be paying a lot of rent which then transpires the capital value which transpires to rates without it we won 't have that money simple as that thanks Richard have any council has got any questions Aaron it 's just when you 've decided to invest your see millions of dollars which is kind of given to your children or taken overseas at the time post-quake when you decided to invest there what was the time line you 're given for these major projects being open well because that must have affected your decision well you know straight after the quake I had a business partner a time we we said no office and we we knew we were gonna get a big insurance check we had to make a decision whether we 're going to rebuild Christchurch LED board and bred you know I love the city and it was a very short decision and we we decided literally within hours that we were going to rebuild to be fair a lot of our work that was done initially was wiped out by the blueprint two years later but you know there the timelines were clear you know no one ever thought it would take this long to do the major projects you know and to be honest the rebuilds been driven by the by the likes of Nick hunt and thank you very much for your presentation this morning it 's much appreciated okay Nick stirrers canterbury employers Chamber of Commerce the aim Watson and Marty Peterson Oh from a very passionate Cantabrian who has shown bold courageous leadership and invested millions in our central city it 's time now for our city 's leaders Council and each and every one of you sitting around the council table today to show that same bold courageous leadership and your decision today the chamber supports the development of a stand-alone multi-use arena the economic and social benefits in the wider region a no-brainer to the visitors of our economy and to be supporting a vibrant sporting and contemporary events calendar are considerable as evidenced by some of the information that you 've just heard from Richard these benefits are even greater after the arena is capable of hosting both high-profile sports events concerts trade shows and major events that is why our preference is that the arena has a roof in its location as in the residential East frame in the modern annoys standards combined with the harsh Canterbury winters means its viability as a multi-use arena it must be fit for purpose and it must ensure that we can host the many concerts that Richard has just outlined it 's also important that we have a venue large enough to earn our Christchurch to compete for those top tier events this means that a minimum capacity of 30,000 to compare favorably was the other venues around the country we believe that Christchurch should often erics and experience to its residents that is comparable to other major cities and what would be expected of living in the sports venue is a piece of public infrastructure and the same way that a concert hall for classical music 's the people of Christchurch should be able to see major sporting events in major musical events as the citizens of other major cities in New Zealand have done for many years the arena also provides a major event venue near the central city to support the hospitality and accommodation sector the CBD has seen bold leadership and brave investment from those sectors leading our city 's regeneration and we must ensure that a vibrant city with a strong event vint 's culture in sports culture supports in a study last year it was found that the Forsyth Barr Stadium had pumped 165 million into the city we 've just seen Dunedin again host the pink concert and I was out very fortunate to attend that pink concert and I can tell you there were many woman in particular down under neden and they didn 't have one shopping bag they had five and the venue 's around around Dunedin were very very full 34 million from Ed Sheeran this is people leaving Christchurch for those sorts of stadiums the impact on our hospitality providers on our accommodation on our retailers particularly in the central city is hurting while stadiums tend not to cover the cost of capital they do cover the operating costs when they are well run and they are a major piece of a public infrastructure for the social and economic benefits of the city in the region and in fact the South Island today you have a choice on the decision that will become a legacy for our city and our region please ensure that the legacy is a positive one and I just want to leave you with a quote that I just found oh good men and woman also known as counselors must take responsibility to create legacies that will take the next generation to a level we could only imagine thank you thank you Michael did you want to add and I have so I invited with me Bruce Garrett from the George Olivier from the new novotel at the airport and Peter Morris the hospitality Association needs would you rather that you go got just be repeating what Richard and the owner said but I think that it 's Brian virtually who 's very has said to me and I think he 's probably said to too many others that it really is it 's the butcher the baker and the candlestick maker that are going to benefit from the stadium and it 's it succinctly ripped it up as far as I 'm concerned it 's some it 's not just for the guys wearing the suits it 's for the people who work for us as well and it 's so thank you all right Dion so something else we 're going to be discussing today around the Central City momentum getting people living in the central the the economic you know the heart of the city that you know that vibrancy and that economic and also the events and stuff like that so the decision that we 're going to make on that do you think also fits into the other decisions that we 're making today and you know do you think the business community will be brought alongside actually make us work for us as well absolutely all of those things so there is a balance of priorities around that but if we don 't have the stadium as Richard very clearly articulated the businesses in the Central City will not exist so a vibrant Central City has made up of the business community and those are the very people that have led the regeneration of our city they 've invested millions billions into the city so we must support them and there is a combination of events activation of things that will bring our residents back into the central city some key marketing on changing the perception in some of the behaviors of our central city making sure that we actually celebrate the wonderful progress that we have made and the Central City in bringing those people back in so events is a key part of it as well that 's directly what your members are saying to you absolutely absolutely Thanks he suggests in response to what Deanna was asking about the Central City item in Regina and just from your comments now are you really a tipping point absolutely there are businesses who are hurting and as I said that these are the very businesses and the very organizations that have actually led our regeneration so we 've got to to date is largely due to the private sector and that we all know there are a lot of a lot of reasons as to why so these businesses are a crucial point as is their Central City Green Thank You Liam what been on the back of that do you feel as sufficient for the business seeker a signal today because obviously it 's going to take if we proceed with the stadium along or multi-use an arena a long time to build so is the strength of a signal sufficient for look I think that that decision is absolutely crucial I think others in the central city making the wrong decisions huge disaster for the city and not only the city but actually New Zealand so this has a flow-on on page wider than what of the Christchurch in Canterbury it has a flow-on impact on the confidence and our city from across the other part of the equation is actually looking at how we can activate things between now and when the multi-use marina stadium does come on board so you know there 's some work being done around looking at how we do some of those things in the central city some marketing 's and some key events to bring people into the back end of the central city so they had to run a parallel you know I think we 're seeing that we are flying in formation you know that there is our sector now believes and Christchurch in said and in a promotional organization we need that horizon we need that we need to understand how far away that stadium is so that we can survive so we can keep the momentum and the enthusiasm and potentially see through the hotel development but but if we can 't see that happening gosh it 's going to be really tough yeah yeah thank you for your presentation I just wonder if we 've had previous deputations around the people should have a say what 's your view on whether say in regards to how the 300 million is allocated and of Christchurch are involved and the regeneration of our city is no doubt about that but there is also a time for the council to show that bold courageous leadership and that is today so we can have the the people of Christchurch and they have been involved across many different platforms and the regeneration of our city but there comes a time where there has to be that bold leadership from a council one that 's today thank you thank you very much Lyon so smart thanks for coming along and the last invitation that we have is on the from the hotel Association and hospitality industry welcome chameleon and counselor so with me today I 've got Bruce Garrett the general manager of the gorge hotel and Peter Morrison who is the president of the hospitality Association of Canterbury and I suppose the the thing is that what we can add to this now is actually the answering of questions Peter would I think we should allow Peter to speak first and then Bruce is a great okay anyway but I 'm just here in support of the stadium going ahead the immortal purpose arena it heard all the facts and figures from Richard pebbles a great developer in this city but we 're going to lose those people we 're going to lose businesses we 've already had bars and restaurants closed the last two winters have been disastrous as you know the stadium was meant to be the multi-purpose stadium was me to be here by now the Convention Center was meant to be here by now we can 't talk in the past but it talks to the future that is the biggest attraction that 's going to keep people here some of our people are already talking about leaving this city and I think Richard brought up about the university if we don 't have this thing this multi-purpose arena won 't work either Michael refer to the butcher the baker the candlestick maker that was actually from me not from virtually I 've always seen I 've always seen everyone thinks it 's just hospitality but it 's not it 's the 's busy cozy taking people to the arena it 's the vegetable the Hydra product vegetable brat and whose will it sells more lettuces to the hotels and the restaurants when it 's busy so it goes right through right to the bottom that employee students were the biggest employer of students in Christchurch and it 's I 'm so emotional about it 's just that we 've gotta get this has to happen and someone asked the question do you think I think of gianni the people we need to go back to the people we don 't need to go back to the people we 've had many discussions over the last two or three years about this and also that we vote new people in to make decisions it 's in your hands and I really really want to tell you we need this arena to go ahead thank you thank you just a couple of things certainly reinforce everything that Richard and the N said very well in terms of the effects and things and just some other aspects of it obviously in a city we needs to be growing it needs that economic momentum happening as it 's been explained the multi-purpose arena is a really key element of that and it 's and it does support right through these sort of major infrastructure items really do support right through the economy right through the local community what is not appreciated by many people is that Christchurch is very very seasonal we the most seasonal major seem to in in the country more so than Auckland more so than Wellington more so than Queenstown in winter everything just goes very very quiet which makes one of those businesses really had to operate and they are closing we will lose them which means that then they won 't be around we won 't have the retail we won 't have the hospitality we won 't have the hotels to accommodate people when we want them and when we and when we need them and so the yeah we have some fantastic things going for the city but we need to have the whole picture we 're losing ground at the moment to all the other major have been static for the last seven years every other major Centre in New Zealand has been growing which is a sign of those economies growing the airport is hosting more numbers are coming through Christchurch Airport near then pre quake which is fantastic but they 're not staying and they 're disappearing all over the rest of the South Island and the rest of the South Island is benefiting we were we still are the major gateway but that is all we 're becoming and we need people to stay here we need them to be those visitors to spend their money here so that then we can use it for the things that we need as a city to pay for the water and the roads and the social housing and the and the well-being of community if we just only have the money that we already have we 're not going to be able to afford those things we need to attract money from outside to come into the city so that we can develop and expand those things I think we will place to answer questions here is that we 're with with the knowledge of when when the stadium will be here we can hang on but only just in its we need to know when it 's going to happen and we need to know it 's going to hit them all right do I have any questions Oh Glen you thank you and thank you for that and thank you for mentioning or acknowledging rather social housing so in terms of Maslow 's hierarchy of needs we would see that obviously you know to be sheltered to be feed to be housed sits at the bottom of that pyramid and something hugely aspirational such as a multi-use arena sits at the top so it 'll be good to get a bearing from you in terms of how you see the needs and the wants of the city coming together and with you in fact see these as a some kind of false dichotomy or do they all belong together it sort of reminds me of that the story give a man to fish and you feed him for a day teach them how if you spend that money now on things such as roads and and so basically that 's all this is ever going to be and it 's going to be gone if we invest in things that are going so sternly act the economy and keep money coming in the future for future generations then we will be able to afford those things so obviously those things like social housing and well-being and those things I mean they 're critical and as you say they 're right at the at the bottom of that pyramid but we need to look to the future and ensure that we can continue to pay for those things going forward I guess you would don 't see everything as part of a system in a city and that housing itself as a system of which social housing is apart so will you entertain the idea notion that if you 're investing in social housing is that it 's an investment as well it 's also a social and economic yes it 's a it 's a multiplier as well I ignored that it is to create its own advantages but but not you know I don 't believe as quickly and clearly is is investing in some of this other infrastructure will do in being able to attract outside money and multiply that effect I think does the issue come back to the cost-sharing agreement is was identified before they had this 200 and you know 217 million or something was was was missing from from the project is to be determined and I think they work might have been an unrealistic expectation at the time I mean I didn 't sign the agreement but that the amount would come from the private sector but what I guess we 're being offered here is that the the crown will meet the difference on the basis that this will give certainty to the project which would support the people that have already invested on the basis that it 's coming it 's coming definitely there 's there 's been a lot of investment of heard from Richard before anticipating these things happen there 's a there 's a lot of hotel projects underway now that the number of restaurants that have really been struggling the motels that have been struggling Peterson the worst couple of winters we 've just experienced and they 're only going to get worse unless we have some things that are going to bring in visitors particularly during that the quieter winter season and it 's not and it 's not all about a couple of wealthy developers sustaining a couple of wealthy developers it 's all the people they employ and then all the money that then puts back into the economy and right right through everywhere people better afford to pay their rent because they won 't have a job and it 's you know it 's going to put more pressure on on social housing the one thing we came from us that one Social Work major social outcome we can promise out of us as jobs all right yeah yeah things thank you very much and appreciate you coming in we 're going to adjourn now for morning tea so if if people could be back here seated at the table ready to go at 50 thank you _"

and the resolution for the apologies no declarations of interest had been recorded and we now we come to public participation and I 'd like to invite Rob Ferguson of the Methodist Mission just speak to counsel he 's been taking it to the streets and I had the opportunity to meet with and I did suggest that it would be an excellent opportunity for him to come and talk to council about what he has been undertaking and and yeah what that means for the city after the quakes the Street Methodist parish which is just down the road from here looked for ways to be relevant to the inner city where they had been since 1864 the longest-serving Church within the city really needs a bit more project that I am the only person off was a response to how to be try to be relevant with no building no office no programs in 2016 I started walking the streets in July with a job description that was deliberately so loose she could drive a bus through it I talked with lots of people all the people I meet on streets they listen to whatever it was they wanted to tell me and I slowly discovered a hidden side of Christchurch 's inner core mist if you walk too fast through the city I think I 've read and photographed almost every plaque I 've set on many of the seats watching people I 've drunk coffee and almost all of the cafes at least once but like you I 've got my favorites as well if the job evolved into reflection there 's a wandering theologian a story collector a reflector and an advocate I 've said on pavements with street ease I visited the rarefied atmosphere of the sixth floor of this building I 've shown tourists with the nearest toilet sir and why is frightened people and I 've laughed uproariously with others I 've been hugged by street ease and strangers and always I 've walked slowly slowly through the city looking and reflecting I photographed many things and not just new or old buildings or supermarket trolleys and very weird places although they 're there as well I 've studied the theory of cities and I 've read the cries for help on bridges and walls in the inner city I love the art and music of this place but I 'm hoping for global warming because the winters on the streets are better and the new lane ways simply funnel cold air I 'm an ore of what 's been done and by what 's not yet happened in the inner city every day I 'm reminded that the city is a place where the stranger lives and that every single one of us is a stranger to almost everybody else on the streets we hear lots about mental health issues and the difficulty in getting treatment some of those are quake related but others are the normal process of human over 50% of the world 's population is now urban the figure will grow faster and faster that means that we 're always living with strangers and yet humans are social animals so in the city we can quickly become loners isolates anonymous and struggle to understand why we can 't make friends it will get more acute in the future planning alone does not solve this but good planning can help there 's growing concern about folk not coming into the university I hear versions of that every day much of it I think is the time that 's passed since the quakes eight years now and people in eight years have formed habits that keep them in familiar other places the same cafes the same roots other things beyond shopping it 's hard to break that habit so I 've shown people around the inner city the rabbits the eels by the bridge of remembrance it e routes plaque told the strange but true story of how come we have a statue of Captain Cook that has no Mears name on it shown them the weeping willow that bricks and discovered the far reaches of the navigable Aven River which is really to be frank just a creek not really a river at all I grew up by the closer I found people often who 've lived here all their lives saying I had no idea this was here it 's the quirky the fun and the new knowledge that will finally bring people into the city shops won 't do it there 's a huge store of things unknown about this place that deserved to be uncovered and explored so as I came to the end of my time with the streets project which I finish in three weeks I pondered how to report to the Methodist parish that employs me after two and a bit years of wandering through the streets of this inner city I chose to make a photo book pictures with few words capture the inner city as I found it way better than reports on a4 paper or even powerpoints it 's been my privilege to have been a loose cannon on the streets of the city it 's a pleasure to report so that you can put it in your archives or check it around wherever you choose many of you I know well now and I 'm glad to be honest that it 's you not me sitting in those seats and I wish you well in the years of here thank you very much that 's um I will pass it round because it 's outstanding and thank you very much and I know that you 're leaving the city so you know just really appreciate what you 've done and it 's and it 's actually a gift that you 're leaving with us and it 's very much appreciated so thank you for coming on next item is a deputation by appointment Camryn Swanson oh I misunderstood this is this appropriate okay well if it gives up people an opportunity you Camryn 's wants online technology speaking to item 14 East guta trading permit application welcome thank you good morning first and foremost I 'd like to thank the council for allowing us the opportunity I 'm here today to talk to you about my background what plan safety precautions are proposed pilot period as well as the program size so why was founded in January 2017 with a mission to transform the world mobility options in the smart equable and same way were the first and largest smart mobility provider with multimodal fleet of doctrine pedal bikes electric assist buddies and electric scooters we currently operate in over 80 markets in five countries New Zealand it 's long been at the top of our list the country 's forward-thinking sustainability practices its embrace of innovation and its citizens healthy well-being practices are key factors for our desire to launch here Christchurch with its flat heartbeat and its history of its rich history of cycling it 's just a natural fit for life we 're excited to see the city at the forefront of this rapidly growing sector securing Christchurch if approved by council will run a 7 operation ensuring a positive customer experience in an orderly public right-of-way our team will consist of a local operations manager and dozens of full-time operation specialists who work on rebalancing and repairs both in the field and in our from the public to join our network of charters that collects in charge of scooters at their own home the paper scooter will be commensurate with the difficulty of finding that scooter as well as the current charge level safety is our number one priority and we will continue to push that agenda here in Christchurch well we can see that it 's impractical to provide a helmet with every single ride we 'll do our best to encourage safe riding practices this includes occasional helmet giveaways on street user demonstrations and trol in a safe riding guidelines and a scooter with front and near lights side reflectors and a dual braking system as with all of our markets we will indemnify the city with a 1 million dollar public liability policy our proposed three-month pilot period will allow 700 scooters to be deployed by My Line at any time the pilot period provides safeguards for the state as well as allows line to determine how best to serve the community through trial following the pilot will propose to increase our fleet to a dynamic cap of 1,500 scooters the city to determine how many scooters will employ on a rolling basis better metrics will offer more scooters whereas worse metrics will lower the cap so I implore you all to review the operational we 've lived plenty of time for questions it 's great thank you Mike it 's great that you 've done this deputation because I have a couple of questions are you looking to bring in a bikes not at this time but potentially in the future because I just noticed in job advertising for the operations manager you mentioned ebikes yeah yes we have three different product lines we 've seen that scooters are the most popular we see just six or seven trips for scooter day versus the bikes which you know he bikes get around three to rule out banks for the future potentially down the track yeah okay and then you talked about helmets so that you understand in it that is good at you to wear helmet it 's my understanding that it 's not required question so you 're looking and just doing similar schemes and all funded in Wellington will be given to users about where the scooters at illegal to be ridden so it 's my understanding that in New Zealand there 's a bit of gray area at the time the scooters can you written both on sidewalks and in on the street we will encourage you know it can change based on the market in California for instance we are required to have her our users right in the street so we tell them that the app when they 're signing up there 's a few screens that they need to swipe through that says if he 's always wear a helmet he 's always right in the street and explains as well we could do something similar here in Christchurch although we can 't necessarily require anything like that we can encourage them to are you aware that the ins ETA website under the low powered vehicle section specifically states that a scooters aren 't able to be written on the road so that they can offer I think particular website the NZ tier one official one under low powered vehicles and it says specifically 's specific on the on your website okay and into the the public liability insurance a million dollars under what circumstances could that be use do you think so I 'm aware that the the contract users will probably say to users you know you 're responsible for whether your right of legally all of those kind of things what type of thing could that be used for so as for certain terms and conditions I have our outdated version attached to have an uber woman I can send you yeah as far as insurance if there any sort of lawsuit for injuries it 's last thing for me and the geofencing and does it mean the bikes can 't_''_2597.27 be ridden past this GOP correct so there 's an area and just to me that that 's must out currently there 's something here the coastal pathway and all the way out down the bays Erie to Sumner and going to Sumner would be the same distance as going all the way down to the south shore which is in the area I 'm wondering if your hope to thank you just picking up on the NZTA as you I 've got an fill and then Yanni just picking up on the NZTA issue but you 'll ensure that whatever advice is given on the air matches up with the legal advice that you get from NZTA yeah in one of their strategic priorities is to increase active transport so this is great great to see young people really appealing and you are I think the biggest issue probably is safety I think it 's what 's coming through from the discussions we 've had already you know Public Safety yeah I don 't have any rosamma computers I 'm so far perhaps just minor injuries from incredibly fast our latest version of the scooter they naturally overall metrics are trans to point didn 't really want you to expect from Thank You Cameron um I understand my questions were here on the safety toe in because I understand that for example because there would be so and like I would see just from the air report that this is like it like a pilot for three months but 's any breach that wasn 't remedy within ten days that in think that would it would be terminated so to make sure it works would if some safety issues that have been right you know been raised and we were concerned about giving us an undertaking they would be work towards that you would work towards resolving those that 's thinking thank you very much we 've come to the end of the ten minutes so don 't think you for your time and yeah thanks for the for bringing the idea to our presentation of petitions it 's a process question obviously someone 's will have questions for staff that the staff may not be able to answer without so a number of us kind of question you know additional questions so are we able to get those asked as part of the staff report well I 'm in the hands of the council if that if people would like to extend the time I 'm happy to accept that you might have been planning to be zipping out of here in ten minutes oh yeah scooting away charging and usage do you charge a bond when people sign up if so what sort of quantum is it we 'd um okay and then also just in terms of the issue of the cost is a senior working with over in other parts of the world is that going to be also done in Christchurch still underway anyone else oh my just one more question in ever cities we juices forth with people trying to take a patch and don 't let anyone else get into it and a little bit it 's more so I wouldn 't necessarily say turf wars but I did have a question which was um somebody emailed me about an older person who 'd had experience overseas of being on the footpath and of course Erin Lee a scooters are very quiet so you know it 's sort of feeling but you know sort of unprotected on a footpath um is there a zero some way of letting people know that you 're you 're coming you know right and you would recommend that if you see an elderly person in front well thank you very much much appreciated so we have no presentation of petitions so I invite Mike Mora and Gary what some to come forward for the wire Pune will hum bhi records on the community board report to Council that we do hips and we 've been naming quite a lot of streets in the area because we 've got quite a lot happening the course of the award the new developments significant council projects and their broad area it was great to go to the 20th anniversary the 7 youth workers just recently some of us that have been around for if I can remember supporting that group to get up and up and running and operating very successfully in our community so we 're very very proud of that association that we 've got with our 7 youth workers who are operating from their schools in the community and resource concede has now been launched evidently he will receive forever and you reckon community center so we 're really looking forward to progressing the progress of that that 's something that 's been quite a long their Ward the we had digs at precinct society come and raised concerns about the old Eddington salience sort indeed safe in general issues around that area so we 're very pleased to know that staff were actually working on that to try and get that area cleaned up as you can see we 've got there 's a mix of TN for the people have been dumping rubbish they 're sleeping rough and it 's just generally a bit of an eyesore so we 've really really like to support the community and encourage their staff to keep working proactively as much as they can to get that area sort of there they 're a resource consent application and on their site the Mayfair Street sword it 's the same owner or not yeah yeah so essentially they will want they want to sort this as part of their has been conceits and and things flagged for that area in the past but they haven 't sort of eventuated so know that I mean we can 't predetermine a result of a results consented yeah so moving on the 've got a lot of groups and organizations that we 've been very very pleased to be able to support with their youth development funding strengthening communities grants and especially discretion your response funds projects so we 've got a an event coming up shortly where some of the youth development funding people are actually coming to report back to our board on how that funding has helped them with their goals and objectives and what that funding was for so we 've really really welcome the opportunity to get that feedback from from our young people and the the sale yards we 've already spoken about and listen to be learned here how to pair things can 't_''_3310.8 happen with skate parks and they are we are very pleased to say that there are no extreme skate park is being built and we 're in the opening the grand opening of that is on the 12th of October which is the last Friday of the school holiday so we 're really looking forward to that I can 't_''_3332.31 say that I won 't be skateboarding that day but I all the people actually that that take part in that activity sorry absolutely I think this thing I think Yanni might be able to come and give a few demonstrations do you very handsome so that 's something that we 're looking forward to and we 're very very pleased to say that Wis fields local hero one of our youth workers mana is got attendant or the Bella Vita youth trust is got a 10,000 grant from Westfield for our local hero so that 's it was only three recipients of that those grants and he 's the only one working locally in record and so that 's really really good and the horse will means that 's a really great asset to the community I can 't wait to get old enough and have enough time to actually go and and join the the men in the men 's sheds but it 's a it 's a great asset to the community and to the to the well-being of the community a course and there 's a lot of skill in the community with them with retired people the knowledge to actually create all sorts of good stuff so I think we really recognize them as a star group in our area and my wheel that other people will be talking about Kate Shepherd later on but anyway cake lived in our Ward and in 83 Clyde Road the property is still there so just recognize that it was people just need to take take that step that big step which Kate did to actually change the world really change the world as far as women 's rights are concerned so we 're very proud to have that association with them with Dena Kate Shepherd so if there 's any questions just a question a question not so much of Mike but of maybe of Carlene and but relevant to the precinct society along about that area but right in the middle of that area right beside that area is our own Road reserved for we 're Blenheim Road was cattle but he Steele who came along with a butterfly garden proposal he 's now developed that proposal and one of the places that we would love to temporary measure while it 's well it 's sitting there doing nothing I don 't know the long-term plans for it but the residents association were favorable towards the community board was fine with it and she 's now developed to con see it who 'd how do we actually produce it let me get back to you produce good question Jimmy chin yes you can move it and you can ask a really good question I did notice I was a bit reluctant to raise okay thank you to move and thickened up Bucky I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye Oh as opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much you are next is why Cora Linwood central bit cut community board report to Council like sillies an apology okay whatever thank you and so I 'm happy of course to take a report has read with a couple of highlights firstly is the granting of a license of a part of rectly park to the commons trust sorry for person to operating the PowerPoint it 's gonna be less printed I incredible new wolf stirred library and there was a hot real highlight of the board 's program and also the excitement over the Linwood Wolf 's and Paul continues to grow and staff have done a great job of outreach by coordinating a group of eight local school children to visit swimming facilities locally and in Selwyn and Timaru and during the order so they can be better informed and so we can draw on their more informed and firm preferences I want to also note the board approved a payment of over thirty thousand dollars to facilitate the rebuilding of Steve 's Long Beach will Road Red Cliffs and these were damaged during the earthquake and has since been longed for work and community have long before they returned ever since and we 're pleased to be able to make it happen however it was noted that the DRF isn 't the appropriate funding channel for capital projects of this nature however we wanted to capitalize on the sharp price of the buyer the contractor completing nearby works and of course we had no desire to see the ratepayer or is even or or even as part of another project that would result in the large amount of staff time to coordinate so the other thing is although not part of this report I 'd like to mention a resolution of the board 's Monday meeting to write members of parliament Porter Williams and Rick Dyson asking them to progress an update to the council 's district plan under Section 71 of the region in residential overlay Clause five point two point two a and would encourage council detects action and the same vein so that 's uh and also finally I 'd like to take a second to acknowledge the immense hard work of ship I a governance manager that 's all almost certainly be her last meeting and and boy has been a wealth of knowledge to me and I 'm sure the risks and the board and I wish her well for her future in Wellington what delivers what she describes yesterday is I kept woman I 've been taken by surprise I didn 't realize this was your last meeting we 're losing you to everything that you 've done I know that you 've been a tremendous source of guidance and support for the community board but actually the relationship with the rest of the council as well in the community I 've get constant feedback about you and you know the you know connections you 've made they 're going to be long held so you 'll always be welcome home don 't make Wellington your home and since you 've stopped on this picture you know just thought how extraordinary that the governor-general came and opened the Linwood North School Hall I just thought it was a fantastic story and she told a story during the opening ceremony and where she talked about how she had been born to a couple of rural teachers and she she 'd said that when she was born she actually was at the back of the classroom and a little better meet and that the children of the school helped to raise her and she had this wonderful connection with were the children I don 't think they 'll ever forget their opening and and what special David I 'm thinking look I just like to speak a wee bit about your Beach full road project and commend the board for the work that they have done to actually get this project and way my only reservation is you 've had to resort to your own drf fund to to get these works done and it 's obviously a sizable chunk of money out of your diario which I feel is rather disappointing for their community board going forward had to expend this amount of money to get this valuable project underway so I would like to suggest that to the chief executive the some mechanism has looked there to restore the community boards discretionary response fund because I believe you know these sort of projects are something that have been benefit for the whole of the city and it seems unusual that you 've had to take the step of using the area manager could do there I 'm I 'm not sure whether there 's a as far as I 'm aware it 's a discretionary response but I could add some parity sorry in the able TP when you 're planning you before and it doesn 't go through which is the reason it came to GRE so it 's been through a council process already to seek funding and we 're always asked to prioritize things and you know priorities sometimes such that won 't make a priority around the table across the city when we 're all thinking with our city pets on rather than our individual community boards but a community board does have a discretionary response fund for the purpose of adding priority to something that wouldn 't make the cut otherwise so David did you want to I totally appreciate all that I 'm just disappointed that council process didn 't delay our funding for this project and they 've had to pay for whatever dr if and community boards have huge calls on their di refund and so I 'll probably just expressing my disappointment that that sort of process had to occur in this instance but I do yeah I mean we agreed it 's a board and it was originally going to be funded out but because it wasn 't safe to put it back exactly where it was and it needed to be moved slightly it became out of scope and so with never done so can I just make a quick comment there clearly at the time of the annual plan we 'll have a chance to rectify and look at those sort of issues and write accordingly thank you all right CEO would you like to move that the report be received and seconded by Danny sorry art for sure so the project manager for the Woolston Community Library I 'm Celina Robertson just wanted to say that there was huge praise on her for what was a really great project basically I really worked with the local community and the volunteer library committee members the library had been going since 1871 it 's one of the oldest libraries in Christchurch and although it 's now a community library volunteer library it 's got a huge history of that goes along with it and I just really wanted to acknowledge the great work that she did bringing that project together along with of our volunteer libraries Red Cliffs em Woolston they 've done an amazing job so I think we should be really proud of the work that they 've done and also and I think possibly for another time but there are a number of local people who helped particularly with some of the furnishings so there was David Wooden 's who donated one of his prints out of order number three which has a shot of the old building there was Murray green who actually had a photo taking the 1952 of people marching down Ferry Road on Anzac Day and he 's allowed us to use it it 's framed with salvaged timber from the old building and there was also other things that we were given and donated so it was just a really great facility that 's that 's that 's open there was a huge community response to it being being opened and although people are said to see the old heritage building not be there anymore it was really touching to have part of the brick from the old building that was presented which is acknowledge the great work that happened on there thank you thank you alright I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much thank you when my meadow pendleton why might a huge community forward my this is terrible I 'm sorry my apologies yeah anyway can somebody find out for me yeah okay well good morning wrong thank you again for the chance to come in and present our update for the month a look it 's relatively light this month and that there are no parties I just want to run through a few things in the report then we 'll touch on a couple of slides in the PowerPoint and first of all we 've obviously used our community board and decision making under delegation ability we 've put in a few no-stopping restrictions and probably the big thing and I 'll touch on it so shortly is around the suction tank and the Jeffries reserve which did go in as well so that was quite a big local issue and we 've used the out some money under there and then just I guess to touch on a couple of the local community issues or events obviously got the bishop del mean she 'd which was involved and a new community garden and which was quite positive we 've put some money towards some lights and the inside Tennis Club on Aven Head Road so again that 's a well used facility in our patch a so it was great to use that as well and then obviously we 've got the brand were youth workers were just continue to do great work so but we 've only got a couple of slides so the first one is around the Jeffries reserve pump station so you 've probably heard me for the last couple of months keep saying how that was coming to the board and it went out for consultation initially there were a couple of challenges with it and then it came back to us after going back out again and look I 'm comfortable we got the right solution on that we listened to deputations that were raised and you know as a result we 've our staff to do a bit of sort of work around mitigating the appearance of that just for affected local residents but I mean I guess the point with that was it 's critical infrastructure that needed to go back effectively we 're the old pump station was and sometimes you kind of have to make those hard decisions and that was one of them in our pitch Erin might touch on now this one yes so the weed and the groins has been sprayed which is great news there 's going to be a mechanical harvesting of that pretty soon after the chemicals had time to act and then hopefully a little needed from that but on the 14th of October we 'll proceed and then finally our group the month is the bringer youth workers so I London the team do a great job working in both carbon and boots on primary they do a lot of stuff around I guess developing young leaders which is really positive in our community and particularly in those areas as well so it gives them something it gives them something a bit of purpose as well so look a really positive thing and as always we like to bring something like that to you just to remember that you know there are really good things happening in our community so look like I said short and sweet this month in the end thanks very much could I just stress a point last week I attended the water New Zealand public consultation here in Christchurch water New Zealanders openly advocating for a new water regulator in New Zealand it 's Havelock North inquiry submission focused on mandatory water treatment and install centralized decision-making on water and on sewer it clearly halts views different to ours and seeks to undermine the local government in my opinion why is the Christchurch City Council well it 's been a member for a very long time and this is not an appropriate use of the community board report so there is a mechanism for raising these issues at Council by way of the notice of motion and various other means and you know Christchurch City Council has been a member of executive Ben regime that has that has taken a very strong advocacy role on the issues that you 've raised but appreciate you raising them but this isn 't quite the right context to do so so I see that these are never let the chance go by attitude arm today okay no that will do will do so Rick would you like to move listening to the report and Jamie second does I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's Kerry thank you very much thank you which won 't be a lot tighter you next time right take part occur thanks for to counsel and he said to me I see into time I 'm absolutely delighted that someone from the council is actually watching asked what is happening on Biggs Peninsula some of us had a hundred and forty five millimeters and so it ranged from 30 to sort of five and maybe even more so it 's good to know that someone is actually watching us on being symmetries update buildings that firefighters and requirements flood protection first one is the para Mary Sue now that 's not coming up white move Chris we need a hand the we 've got a picture of the development plan of the reserve and our slides and Ramar is a small area behind a recreation reserved area behind Littleton I have talked about it before but this last month of which we only had one meeting last month so that 's why I reports pretty short this time we we made a decision the board made the decision we have been working we had been working with with the community we had a workshop to to work with those and that to find a solution the way through but we were unable to find a clear solution so the board ultimately decided to make the decision so it 's a mixed area it 's got walking tracks cycling tracks and there 's an escalation of estimation of unmarked trails throughout this throughout this area so because it 's small and there 's cyclists that want to use it it was decided by the board that we needed to take some had quite a process around it there are a number of conflicts the board take took over the decision-making of it and we 've got that final decision so we 're just moving forward and we 'll be assisting the the the governance of that which is the reserve management committee with good management and working well as a staff moving forward the next month of next one is about the the cemeteries and we are also making incredible process with progress with that and you 'll see in our notes there where we had deputations from our community who at the moment are very passionate about cemeteries not only because the bond or handbook of the symmetries behind or handbook is under review but because they are patient about their cemeteries and some of the older ones for example so we are looking at removing some of the large pines that are an area but they feel as though they 're not respecting the bodies as well the tree has more respect than what the bodies have on the cemetery so we 're looking at a way forward of now how does that go so we 're working well with the with the with the staff and with the with the community so we 're looking for good outcomes we 're right at the next one buildings met firefighting requirements now this is this is an unusual issue there are under the fins the rural and the urban firefighters have been brought together and there are some rules and the for firefighting in rural and communities when a restricted when a restricted water supplier have to comply with with firefighting issues and so in this bird legs flat community those small properties on very small sections need to have a 27,000 liter water tank on their properties each property at this stage so what we 're looking is aboard is looking for is looking for some assistance at looking at better way of doing it for buildings fled and maybe that there are it takes somewhere that they could all plug into and things so it is an issue for this particular community and there will be issues for other communities and we 're working through that I 'm 've moved pages now so we 're now onto the next one and I 'll talk about the flood protection by Lorde now this is around Little River of where I 've said that in coop town they had 100 mils of rain just that was on an about a 36-hour period just recently but this flood protection by law we 're off to Environment Canterbury with a submission and we 're supporting what is already what the community have already done now this goes back to 2014 where there was some quite major floods in Little River the community was concerned they we had public meetings we got a group together a flood working party and we went to Environment Canterbury with what we knew with what we wanted and we now have a flood rating district in their catchment it 's um the whole catchment of whaaaaaa it 's a Little River catchment and they all pay the same amount of funding and we were just supporting this so this is the sort of flood catchment plan that because it 's around a river and and and Rural Canterbury not the City Council as we know and so we had to work through a process to get it so it 's quite a process to get a River rating district around this area but it was achieved and we may have to look at other areas down the track not an easy process to get the community to agree to pay for their own rating district so we 're just supporting that in the process and we 've got submissions all on the same days we 've got our other freedom camping ones on the 17th of 17th of August so the last one that I 'm highlighting here and I have had an opportunity this morning thank you team to be able to join one of the the state highways or join with a meeting that that I 'll be able to observe bring to the table some of our bigs financial issues around state highway 74 and state highway 75 so we have got a number of issues around the state highway and there 's also some in Littleton and there 's some and rah and the crossing in Littleton that doesn 't seem to be working appropriately is it suggested it should be is that when somebody walks up to the crossing that will change lights and things that doesn 't seem to be working as it should be so and we have a whole list of things so we were water going to the council going to asking in fact asking that the state highways group to come and talk to us and resolve a few of these issues that we have got so you 'll see there an eight point three prior to the commencement an assessment of how the the pedestrian crossing on Norwich King is operating now it 's not ivory making writing Andrew can probably explain why it 's not operating appropriately but it 's all about the lights don 't seem to be working don 't seem to be synchronizing for crossing that particular Road so these just a few little snippets of what 's come out of our minutes thank you very much and zero would like to second it so is there any are there any questions really interesting look at your strengthening communities funding yes one name that I didn 't see on there that I expected to see on there was the okay into a museum so I just wondered if they applied or whether why they 're not funded through the community poor well I can 't actually answer that yeah but there is some special work that is being done with the kids by communities around the reserve in the museum at the moment but no this was I think they might have missed the the timeline discussions between Nigel 's museum and Penelope Goldstone the governance manager around what the most appropriate source of funding from council would be I imagine Nigel would have taken that advice and responded accordingly but I don 't have the detail and to hand I 'm sorry no no so it obviously didn 't ever come across our table at that time all right I will put the motor all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much thanks grace the next is the white eye coastal barrier is actually sorry we don 't have a picture for this it 's really quite exciting that 's the Eastern community sport and recreational corporation they applied for a list granted over the 40th sports and Rafferty domain and a license to this time to be cozy with the neighbors always together [Music] the next picture that we have these are just absolutely amazing that used to be installed on from absolutely the border really keen to see that these pieces of art is active in some capacity so we 've staff looked into this and with the NZTA and making some really good acquirers as to how can we possibly in that area the next one I have in my list of the border Haven Bauer everything 's came to us site making the staff a really very positive meeting and staff were able to offer some advice there and some things that were able to actually resolve those issues so they will be implemented in Jeep Corsa and then the great outcome so the breeze walking festival places like the libraries and other places to find it exactly September 14th enjoy that now we 're really excited about this people in Christchurch and we 've also got errors they 're pointing them and to the direction of the Spencer park and also they 're gonna put a couple of new signs on both the New Brighton South Wales rent so that was another fantastic outcome just to help these issues with the freedom campaign that we 're having so thanks very artistic [Music] near Brighton there 's a few things they put them there but this one here needed to find a new home I was getting a little bit tired so it was a really great liberation and smart darling New Zealand doesn 't hey would you like to have this on your site on your sensory garden so this is the thing and staff and Costilla staff so that was been tested its freedom initiative slide but the freedom can--they initiative the board were very pleased that there was some funding through the government 's tourism facilities development grant but Thompson packed Oilers as part of the freedom camping initiative so there 's most appreciated because with associations that get better information you just need to go to their website which is called shaping education and all the informations there and thank you question nagging you 'd like to move second a bike limb discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye placed a night it 's my horrible spread and Kashmir community board welcome here at at Oh like horror for me as an Westers hard to pronounce as everybody else 's but we 're thrilled to have our name as well this is week the Christchurch Youth Council community series so kicked off and sprayed in Kashmir so it 's and so they with the aim of getting young people to come along to pitch an idea of something that they would like to see and spoke in Kashmir and so two of the three pictures turned up one was about TEDx youth it was a very professional young people they wanted to do basically a tvx youth event that they can be owned by a hundred people to the other pitch was about a youth market in their area 't able to come but it was about an bike safety she was from South intermediate and wanted it was a really great the TDC fun one it so they were competing some funding to see that area doing something and we were allowed to speak as well as we talked Carolyn and I about community board and what we do so that we sort of split this was our community service a new service awards which we held in the old stone house and there is such a fantastic building for this kind of a case ah did she say of people circulating and the staff provided all the food they still won 't do cream and in crafts house and amongst them as karo who is a crate craft herself and her great-great-grandfather was the one who built the original building but many of these people have served the community in so many different ways that you 'd like to go through the list of people that are sitting there looking at us and talked and talked just about them but all of all the people who received mean they when they came up they were but had the heave down they were kind of embarrassed to be getting an award and it was just so lovely because they do I can 't remember they did they do such a lot of work and we hear comments from some of the older people and the other side of the ward saying that they were so pleased to see them there because they don 't hear the types of work that they do so that was for me the highlight it was it was great so we 've got a community events funding as a board that came from Barrington big firm that we 're no longer holding to people that can come to the board and request funding for an event that they want to he 'll hold locally and then they also will get training so this is one that 's going to be held quite soon helped by youth the Presbyterian Church Mellon Reserve in October this well this is part of them huge media we are attracting we haven 't paid any any money to about the age-friendly initiative which is isn 't there 's an appalling name anybody Erin anybody who 's got some imaginative name for an age-friendly initiative please come and talk to us because could it be more drear could you fall asleep quicker so but the project itself is very exciting and it is about supporting and walking shoulder-to-shoulder and having an adventure with those people who are older and we are thinking of initiatives that we can take in our ward with people who are older that are healthier than they 've ever been in those age groups oh this is terrific the staff because I think but our board is always pressed on the issue of disability access and the staff came to us with a proposal for the renovation of Barrington playground which is a very popular playground next door to the library and next door to the mall with the renovation that to be disability access oriented and so and it opens on Saturday but we 've already seen the teenagers coming to the park and lying in the disability swing just for example with their can say to them quietly and gently that people with disability must have priority but the teenagers are very welcome in the dark and in the night July on some of the things are now playground when the people with disability out there the teenagers are very welcome to camp and they might like to come at night like they do to the magnet mainly where they have a lot of fun as well so but we 're very we are very much looking forward to it and as usual the staff come up with a really good idea and called it the superheroes picnic so we 've got the challenge of dressing up as well for the opening Oh God knows God knows something they 'll hide the red cheeks there 's been consultation and 153 submissions in the consultation process sprayed neighborhood s they commented Easter day they just came to our board meeting on Tuesday some very small tiny little alterations to the plan but I think overall everyone 's very pleased with how it 's going after all of these years yeah and we are to called hoon hey by the human Bible City Council for all of these years the suburb has got a very active residents Association which used to provide a welcome pack to every new person who came into the craft area that the new developments are all these Road etcetera have made that impossible to maintain but they are an extraordinarily active group of people one or two of whom were amongst those gardeners that we showed before and they 're an extraordinarily active group and they would like to have had their own name and not food hey which is claiming so and Helen Mount hélène mountain on our board had another go at it and using the fact that the name was recognized by the national craft was recognized by the geographic board and the National I wrote Ord and all sorts of other organizations and the only one who still called a tune hey was Christchurch City Council and that is now been rectified in their be replaced in Chapter I said it and I also want to mention briefly that the his River Network volunteers had their 28th of July and then again was led by the lane who was one of the founders of the river network which is a very effective body that links all the organization 's based on the river right from us down to the sea and these organizations are active through the river network and for instance are the ones that have been to the mother of all cleanups and we are very happy and pleased that that was initiated the now bored and leave thank you Friday in the was so okay the gone a little bit over time so you 'll take it move by yeah turn men seconded by Phil and I 'll put the motion I 'm sorry but thank you very much all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you the next is the wipe up up annoy this is much awaited by the community this is a small Burns Park really hasn 't been able to operate to its full potential for the last eight years obviously but prior to that as well because of poor drainage the because of the weather it 's been very very wet but the pavilion itself we are soft opening we are inviting some community inviting community along to the soft open on the 15th of September oh yes this is really lovely we had we 've been meeting and talking with residents in the Dudley Street works area and clearly there 's been a lot of stress this is a Richmond Arlington miter how primarily Shirley in Darlington area and for a very long time residents there have had to manage an awful lot of disruption and on August the 31st the official end of the Dudley Creek flood mitigation works an occurrence of an ending the to cite compounds were wound up and handed back in the bulk of the Dudley Creek contractors were out of the area on the city first and this is something that was clearly signaled to the community in meetings and communications with them there 's still some planting that 's still to go on I 'll come back to the letters in a moment but this is the kind of sorry challenged so we bottom for water obviously there 's been some really beautiful planting in the area as well which is making a huge difference to the amenity there and roads have been reopening again which also is pretty important to the amenity and the community one of the issues remains and it is a major issue and that is the the condition of the roads generally in pavements however that as being looked at by staff and we will be addressing that in early October directly with with the community when we have our follow up community meetings so that 's been called for and heard by the community board and by staff there was a letter going back to the letters that and this was an initiative from Joe Boone actually who pride of being on the community board was very involved in the flocked and flooding issue as a spokesperson and very well connected so she went back to some of the flopped and residents to explain and they already knew anyway because of the coverage but the the stress and and anxiety and disruption that the people in the and and the San Albans Creek works being done and but they actually don 't see the the outcome of that this is being done for further down the line so the floc turn the flock turn basin people wrote these really lovely how it felt notes that were communicated to the Shirley Richmond community this is one meter that came from Angela and Phil and they said to the residents of the Richmond area we want to pass on our sincere appreciation to the residents of Richmond for what they 've had to go through over the last few years during the flood mitigation works for the flopped and basin area we can only imagine how difficult the constant noise stress road closures disruption to businesses amongst many other things have been for you and we want to pass on and thank you for your understanding as a previous resident at the lower end of flopped and I remember the stress and anxiety with each heavy rainfall the lifting of everything in the house the leaving home with our young baby toddler every time the water reached the bottom the next day to see how bad the damage was I 'm so thankful that the current residents and the flocked and basin don 't have to go through that again and again and again and it is because of you and what you have endured in recent times that they can comfortably live in their homes and continue on with their lives without fear and anxiety a very heartfelt thank you so those messages really were well received and I thank Joe Boone for that initiative and and obtaining that continuing through we are still dealing with roading issues in the ward primarily these well these are primarily the main concerns we have the Cranford Street downstream mitigation plan which is in process at the moment and the board is having or will be hearing a report back from the roading engineer who has seen listened understood all of the issues through the submissions and he will be putting those into a plan and speaking to the community board about those and getting feedback from us there is another opportunity for the community to be consulted and feedback as walking festival that is citywide but of course we 've got some great areas and the Perpignan award that we will be being involved in that I also wanted to quickly mention the Maine North Road bus priority project which was to be decided by the board at our last meeting and that was actually laid on the table while we asked for some more information this is with regards to the little bit between and an important but from here Wood Road to Winston eV and we asked for more information after hearing from the businesses so that is still in train I also wanted to mention the time capsule that we are on the 14th of September this is gonna be really cool because we don 't know what 's in it and this is a time capsule that was in the former Resource Center and sand Albans it 's an orbán 's community center it was known as a news days as well and we 're opening that with local schoolkids and others from the community on 14th of September and then starting a project on setting that and again the schools will be key and that I also wanted to mention the 125th anniversary of women achieving the votes as you will know that 's being celebrated this year the reason I 'm mentioning this is that there is a woman in our Ward called Rachel Harris who is on the board of the National Council of women I 've just stepped down from the board of the National Council of women as we continue to deal with EQC and insurance issues and Christchurch 's just taking too much of my time so the prime minister is the keynote speaker as an event at the Isaac theatre royal on the 13th of September and she 'll underlined the role of Christchurch as the birthplace of the suffrage movement and of course the National Council of women headed by Kate Shepard had the first meeting in Christchurch 122 years ago that was three years after women achieved the right to vote it 's a very different group of women hitting that organization now but they 've just recently announced Helen Clarke as the patron of the organization last weekend I 'd like to finish with a shameless plug for the Kate Seaford memorial trust suffrage 125th celebration and fundraiser which is taking place on Wednesday the 19th of September at the Knox Church at 30 and it will featured Galen Preston so it will be a really awesome event and it 's called herstory misadventures in film land an evening of entertainment mixing and mingling with refreshments if you want to know any more about that you can get in touch with me through Facebook or Google the cake chip at memorial trust award and I hope that you go along and see that it will be a fantastic event thank you does anyone have any questions David you just want to have a matter of curiosity I may have missed it but the time capsule that you have lifted all right I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much we 'll just take a we 're taking a 10 to 15 minute break I know that some of you wanted to get an 're gonna go out the back and those that keen on on that can go with Brendan and the rest of us can go and get to your coffee so we 'll see you back here it say 1111 25 or start up again things you right could I invite Paula Smith on a platter Reuben and Alan learn from the three zone committees to join us at the front of the table okay none of you is recognizable as L in them right okay thank you no you don 't write apology the ground water protection one of the main issues at the moment for the zoning committee is the groundwater modeling that shown is groundwater from a district flowing underneath my making into the modeling shows that there 's a high probability of the deeper Christchurch aquifer those receiving of this water and it also predicts their total effect particularly the north eastern sector at the moment the principal focus has been on nitrate concentrations which predicted to increase discipline itself has some serious problems with nitrate concentrations in their groundwater in consultation with farmers in the area after these meetings the crotchet saying committee commended the work being done by the war in my career his own committee in its targets for the microclimates in the groundwater the consultation process with farmers in the war in the kerreri area is now largely complete and a staged approach to reducing the nitrate load is being proposed the stage approach requires that the farmers in the area will eventually quite even better than good management practice in order to target this is quite severe current modeling suggests crunchers drinking water and the affected areas in the Christchurch City will rise slightly in the short to longer term that will ultimately be less than 50% of the maximal maximum allowable value within the proposed targets consequently it 's unlikely to result I 'll be presenting the information to the committee next week in more detail ground water storm water and streams the zone committee of the storm water quality which in turn improve the quality of last year that Christchurch don 't committee had a very successful public interaction at the meat in the middle event at Chris reach and be the t-shirt will be prisoned against again this year 's event and since then the logo has been used at many different events to zone committee members and the storm water superhero shirts had been prison when new inspectors we 're looking to produce a mobile stormwater education resource probably on something that is probable like a trailer that can be located at public events it 'll be available to the community groups schools and so on to try and educate the general public on what happens to these stormwater and in the process to try and change the behavior research shows that about 60% of Christchurch residents don 't actually realized that drains lead to screens in rivers and then mainly untreated to the sea better to restrict pollution of the stormwater through education rather than hip to treat our rivers and springs and the result theater defense at the top of the cliff rather than the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff face the zone committee would like to thank the council for promoting the copper free brake pads motion at the recent local government forum committee initiated so we thank you very much for that and I hear it passed very successfully two of our committee were present at a recent field day for developers and contractors to address the problems with erosion and sediment from primarily reporters in the river this is a particularly serious problem after the Port Hills fires where the erosion is now greatly increased the field day was the second such event we held one last year and was extremely well attended should heed that there 's recently been two significant fines imposed for breaches of the sediment control in this area so as well as the character is the big step and the Kashmere stream made the finals for the restoration there 's a planting day the Saturday councillors would like to see some of the immediate steps funding the nature of the spring head of the cash flow stream and the zone committee is working with you came and the council and volunteered to put on a possible funding application for the Heathcoat to the billion funding normal deck zone committee is floating a revival of the concept way back in 1997 proposal was and I quote to capture the experience in broad vistas of formerly extensive primeval grasslands shrublands and woodlands in the canterbury plains the park would ensure the ongoing protection of the nationally unique and new zealand dry grassland environment that would give a dry plant experience similar to the survivors developed steps the American prairies or the South American pampas bio test such as the last significant stance or very old koh phi trees which I 'm sure you 've all seen close to Christchurch would be included in the park some of the land there is already under an ecological Heritage status we 're currently in conversation with the biodiversity Ranger he can in the least miniature of the ekayon land about future opportunities for the pack in the ekayon lane south of the winemaker deputations to the zone committee recent imputations to the committee included from the east lake trust in behavin Heath Coates who tied trusts the East Lake Trust were presenting their case for the East Lake in the red zone lively discussion after its a number of questions arose members prison additional information was required by the same committee in the East Lake trust was going to make some of their submissions to regenerate the Amon Heathcote estuary trust gave a presentation about the work of the trust one message to this council the discussions was that trust expressed a preference for the dual cycleway walkway long Humphreys drive to pass through charlesworth reserve adjacent to Humphreys Drive rather than have been on the eastern side of the road the zone committee congratulated the trust on becoming an international Flyway site finally the Christchurch City Council presented the results of the 2017 surface water quality monitoring report unfortunately the results confirmed that the urban stream syndrome thank you very much I think probably because of the issues involved we 'll just start with this one and then have questions and then move on to the other two of these all right yeah new Becky would Becky so oh gosh Pauline Andrew I 'm just mindful of the thought fact that we are time limited but also that we have got a water forum on Friday week tomorrow week yeah just in terms of the leaching of the nitrates under the Womack what area of land is actually involved in the Womack district canceled that 's responsible for that has been reasonably well defined by the modeling it 's what what made the area yes sir so thank you given I just the research you really were telling us about regarding the nitrate concentrates in groundwater coming from so involved with it Andrew thank you just referring to the very last line in the written information that we 've got here relating to the Interzone groundwater nitrate issue I mean clearly this is something that we in Christchurch have got significant interesting given the inter zonal nature of the problem we don 't have the benefit of an update of the type you 've just given from the Waimakariri zone committing public feedback will be sort on the draft Waimakariri zip addendum for the solutions package in september what process or what type of avenues are there for that feedback are there public meetings will there be a formal submissions and hearings process what does public feedback look like and a year at the moment but we 're talking about things like a walk-in day where we have both committees prison and people can walk in off the street and we 'll all be there to answer questions at the moment I mean there 's a large consultation process and that 's exactly what worries me we 've got an issue that affects Christ you possibly affects Christchurch to a greater extent or at least to the same extent as it affects Waimakariri we 're not involved in the consultation and the engagement to anything like the same degree excellence I guess my request really is can we just make sure that we as a council are kept informed of our opportunity to participate whether through our councillor representation on your committing or through these updates thank you and I think that the water forum is also an opportunity we sat down with egain which is the other partner and the Canterbury water management strategy and the and I think it will be really important that we look you know bring Waimakariri you know into the picture because as you a much more immediate and pressing problem on their side of the river in relation to their groundwater they do they do I know that yeah Jonnie did you have a question yeah I mean I just was just really concerned around the silt roll-off last night I went for a walk along the hit cut River through closer to the ferry made side you know and the history and just people keep saying that they just can 't believe the color of the water and so it I just kind of wonder what we 're actually doing you 've said that two people were prosecuted yes it just seems to me like initially after the fires I think we asked what was going on in the advice bet we had was we haven 't seen it at an increased level then what would be normal so we don 't think there 's been a huge impact but just looking at the river and hearing from people that walk along the river they seem to think that there has been a significant impact of sediment and and stuff going into just give us any understanding of what other work we could do we should do to try and address that if that 's that 's been actively which was for contractors and developers who are developing things on the port hills and there 's a to stop the statement getting them to the river Beattie okay so stuff is available out there and we 've had two field days for contractors and developers but basically this has been the weirdest like do you think having actually an active monitoring would be beneficial that we should put on the agenda when we see the results from the survey thank you look Paula Smith an excellent segue into excellent which it is not peculiar to the port hills all over the big signature and it 's affecting the Selwyn catchments as well right settlement issue and the other point I 'd make is that the majority of people who live in the best mention zone it would apply from the groundwater system city council managers so we were affected by if there 's a risk associated nitrates our communities are affected as on the 7th of June we 've had three meetings the first was in June on Governors Bay where we further explored forestry issues with both staff who provide advice about the new national standard for plantation forestry and from members of the public and we and we 're aware that the new in EES will have an impact and result in amendments both to the regional plans you 're a true city council district clean 17th of July our meeting was in Littleton and we had a paper about the perch springs of Banks Peninsula a presentation by University of Canterbury volcanologists dr. Sam Hampton it was a very high level of community interest in this in this matter and from that we 're two recommendations mainly directed at council because the information that we were presented highlighted the risks and opportunities for the management of the recharge zone as for this groundwater systems and for a potential for problems with crisis city council proposals for deep well injection of wastewater and also possibly opportunities for community will supply it okay in Spain which might be cheaper and better allocated most of its 100,000 budget of immediate States funding to six projects across we also have resolved to have an annual funding round formal one rather than just deal with these applications as they arrive because we are now at a point where it 's oversubscribed and then the third meeting we 've had since I last spoke to you was building this place one between the 1st of August we had a dictation from the leader of the akuti Valley project about the issue which is an agenda about the fencing about many things one of which was that akuti belly is a spawning site for lamprey and but also about the fencing of eastern elaborative which was an issue that would be a race before and I 'm pleased to be able to tell you that since being resolved at that meeting it wasn 't clear that the fit new fence wants to be totally funded but since the apparently now is an and the stock will be kept down a particular section of Esplanade reserve but we also talked about briefly about the crusher City Council brief update on the council 's sites of ecological significance program next meeting is on the 18th of September coming up it 's an opera and the main topic will be the new seasons water quality monitoring results so we 've got our fingers crossed that we might see some improvement with ekayon councillors and listen another couple of things that have come up one was the akuti fence and another issue about trying to get some names on some of our streams on local roads on the bridges they 've they made us think a bit about this forum as a means of communicating with you this quarterly update report and this is our one and only opportunity to interact at a governance to governance level with you people and apart from excellent member councils tuna who is on our committee and just put a I 've just got a question little bit about why why it was it the zone committees minutes stopped going to the AG committee and and because to me I mean I 'm even listen to the community board reports there 's a lot 't seem like a particularly effective way to resolve things or we have no ability to organize having any ability to influence funding we can 't make submissions on the and I think there 's a growing level of frustration about you know this level of conversations not particularly effective so I 've just wonder where he might give that some thought you know do we add value what you do by doing this well the the only reason really to to bring it here is that counselors had no line of sight that we are in a partnership with he can over the same committees through the canterbury water management strategy and without reporting without a reporting line that brought all of the counselors around the table that didn 't seem to but i mean i agree that making deputations to committees isn 't actually the most i mean essentially it 's what you 're doing mate isn 't the effective way of decision making no way but but that 's not what this is for this is to make sure that there is awareness in that there 's you 've raised have ended up in the media because you have come and presented them to the council no well I agree and and it seems to me that the water form that we have with with a cane would be the most effective place for that to occur and then if there 's a particular issue that wants to come out but I think I 'd rather also find a way of wrapping listen to the into the water forums that we 're having you know sort of bimonthly with them I can I 'm sorry we established a relationship with a keen and and started a govern governance to governance meeting arrangement between councillors and commissioners at the time and subsequently it split into two and one month would be a water forum and in the following time but they 're only held every two months okay I can 't remember the exactly off the top of my head but and then the next two months it 's so it 's a generic one so it 's not another forum all the time but I mean it I 've just seen that wouldn 't it be better to provide an inclusive way of bringing the zone committees into the water forum the next one is Friday week so just leave it with us then we 'll see what we can do minutes where do the minutes currently go obviously they come back to the committee to be reported back at its next meeting but those minutes currently get reported to eke an or the City Council in any formal way I don 't think they come to the City Council in my view is appropriate they come to the community board but it may well be that we consider bringing them to easy as well as paulina suggested so and at he can do they go are they reported to the ECAM council we we meet in the same way with egain once every two or three months I think is not that we go to the meetings okay and then a more specific question on the report itself the paragraph just before the the picture in the report that relates to Sam Hamptons presentation on the was that these findings be considered in decisions about the future management drinking water supplies particularly in Akane 's Bay and the second of which relates to providing Sam Hampton with an opportunity to evaluate the results of the deep bore injection trials for the a corral wastewater disposal have you had as chair of the committee any response back from the City Council as to how those two recommendations of landed on how they 're going to be dealt with no the only communication we 've had has been from you so again it worries me that there are recommendations that have come from the committee which need to be picked up somewhere I don 't know where they go out of a process and I 'm not sure where that you know the formal process for dealing with those recommendations but there are two things here that need to be picked up because they 're both important and I would hate to see those recommendations just disappear and not be picked up in any meaningful way particularly when there are community members that may well have become aware recommendations and therefore have a reasonable expectation that a well trusted person in the form of Sam Hampton will have some evaluation input into the results of the deep well injection which is going to be a matter of huge public opinion anyway we did have a briefing from Mike Burke at a community board meeting at a seminar last Monday and he did say in the conversation that Sam Hampton had actually been up at the the drilling site when they were removing a core sample so Sam has obviously already got a working relationship with the city at the moment the point that council Tina 's making like I think he 's responding to the actual report from the Banks Peninsula sign committee which is to request that there 's a specific role for him in terms of his own dependence and status at the University is it the deep well injection trial the zone committee quite rightly in response to a detailed and really interesting presentation have made a recommendation but as a member of the zone committee and as a member of this council I need some formal way so just well perhaps the the easiest way would be to simply in receiving these reports note the request of the Banks Peninsula zone committee for requesting CCC consider providing Sam Hampton with an opportunity to evaluate the results of the deep bore injection trials for the okra wastewater disposal in refer the matter to staff so I mean that way we 're noting that that 's your recommendation and we 're referring it to to the management of the organization no no but I 'm trying to and you 're behind here we 're trying to find a solution to a particular problem that has been raised on this occasion that doesn 't solve the problem yes I 'm very very aware of this now we should have been in your report and then I could have taken some advice on what we might have been able to do but the perception that says Banks Peninsula Water Management Committee the committees themselves don 't have any input on okay all right well there might be another element that we will look at as well so thank [Laughter] you wouldn 't have got this far without without coming to the council so all right so if I could just now hand over to the person who has been involved in one is to celebrate with you which was I guess the joint workshop of design committee with the two governor 's it 's pretty heavy for those and I hope shouldn 't be any on the council the team oh-ho governor 's representatives of niter who this council Environment Canterbury counselors in seven district council the significance is that I guess to get a healthy lake there 's a couple of things need to be done serious improvements in the catchment itself and also some interventions some action in the lake itself it 's always been very very clear to the design committee and deeds of others that anything in the lake needs to be led by night ah-hoo and I guess that leadership is through the local governments so it 's very very significant because the zone committee has focused its actions I 'm trying to get the game lifted in terms of particularly farming indication 's in the zone committee having a delightfully full and frank communication and conversation actually on them on the shore of T WA the only other thing I want to touch on is I guess remind the councillors that the so called refresh of the design committee community members will start from next week so community members on design committee serve three-year terms so at the end of this year there will be different numbers of community members terms across all of the teams on committees that effectively come up for that file that first and so there 's a prices for seeking expressions of interest from anyone who has an interest in water in particular designs to apply and in this process a selection process and certainly a number of counselors have been involved in in the past so the refresh process like is launched the start of next week and he 's expressions of interest the final date for those so I would encourage all they can think of people who would be interested in joining zone committees encourage them to apply because the strength of zone committees a lot of people apply them so that working group counselors to actually get a good choice I celebrate very good there any questions all right so I 've got no I haven 't got a mover and a seconder but I 'm just wondering whether we want to add another resolution I was just busy trying to word it but something along the lines of request staff to meet what the zone committee representatives and develop a mechanism for ensuring that in Schwerin yeah that it 's kind of like we take input from the community boards when we 're doing that LTP and the annual plans so it 's kind of like ensuring that the appropriate engagement or appropriate [Music] but but it 's it 's it 's information request but it 's also they want to important to the and to decisions around the the plans that we make in terms of allocation of funding for particular things you know so for ensuring that for ensuring appropriate and input into the into relevant council decision making processes so as it 's just to just try and I 'm just trying to write the the wording for getting it anyway if we ask them to meet with throne committee representatives to develop a mechanism for ensuring appropriate important relevant council decision making processes and report back what yeah it 'll be when are you due to come back December oh no we don 't want to do their report back by the end of well report back by the end of November so that way we could actually have a paper that ties on what the amazing I don 't know well I was just trying to think of a that 's the point we are a committee of you yeah we are your committee this is a governance role that we are in and it 's not a staff to staff thing yeah we 're becoming really frustrated because we have no ability to influence staff I 'm hearing you I 'm definitely hearing it so if we leave it at the representatives then that can be the council Council or representatives and the the chairs so and I don 't think we need to just say the proper conversations having [Music] and I 'm just also want to kind of almost direct ourselves to discuss this at the water forum next week as well we 've got a bit of a get we don 't hear anything from the Regional Committee so I 'm wondering if we want to do something about that do they want to report through here as well yeah yeah what 's it you 're serious our representative on the regional one but you know it 's um who 'd she is the regional one okay um it 's just the Regional Committee who 's a representative on the regional committee but they kind of deal with pain Canterbury issues is it right rather than specific measures okay they do a lot of the time we 're not very interested we get a report back from major designs at the regional matter with the committee meetings yeah and all the meetings are public in the minutes and everything are all just like the yeah look I don 't want to kind of hold this up but I mean we can easily put next week we don 't need a resolution to do that Andrew yeah I think that 's a really good idea I think today 's presentations and the discussion that 's resulted from them is highlighted that there are some expression in terms of the way that the zone committees relate to council the idea that we 've got governance bodies which are a governance body of council or a joint governance body of council that have got no realistic way of reporting into Council and reporting their resolutions into Council in a formal sense does seem very unusual you know we wouldn 't have community boards that passed recommendations that then didn 't make a decision on them it appears that the recommendations coming out of the zone committees are dealt with by staff rather than us as governors if the mechanism is that we need to pick up those recommendations by way of passing resolutions at meetings like this Sobeys but I don 't think that was what was intended I think we 've actually through a number of conversations uncovered that the way for dealing with resolutions also to have committees that aren 't able to submit on council policy documents submissions and financial plans and so on doesn 't seem to be a good outcome either at the same time we 've had a from another one of those own committees today that finding community members to serve on these committees may be problematic again people will be willing to volunteer their time for meaningful roles where they can make a difference but to have a role on a committee where there seems to be some doubt as to the actual ability of that committee to influence anything in real sense I think that probably leads problem that was discussed today as well I 'd actually like to see this whole thing discussed at the next water forum or as soon as we can because it looks as though there are some constitutional issues around these zone committees that need to be dealt with that may well become more relevant as we move into an environment with a fully elected Environment Canterbury then there 's been a lot more goodwill around the CWM s moving into need to get this tied down now before that happens so I 'd quite like to see all of the issues that have been raised today refer to the Water Forum for a good discussion between governments and I 've just said that we 'll pop it on the agenda so would someone like to move the motion that we have in front of us Andrew seconded Phil I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much thank you really appreciate your hard work on behalf of Henry so the Hornby library customer services and Southwest Leisure Centre project yep so you just I 'm gonna I 'll get you two I mean we can take it as read but and I don 't know where there are any questions but I just thought I 'd elude the fact that counsel Chen 's identified just a small change to the second resolution which simply instead of saying agree that staff implement the process to expediently identify an alternative site and says agree that staff implement the process just simply identifies them the body of the paper what the process is it 's a belts and braces approach which i think is very sensible under the circumstances so there Jimmy would you like to move this residues yeah my question is are we open to looking at not having these facilities co-located I 'm certainly from my perspective having been involved in the hearings panel a couple of conclusions I came to was that the library could actually go on the current site and the budget was pretty overcooked when I looked at some of the library rebuilds that we 've been done so is that something that will be considered are you still going to progress with the big co-located option however the outcomes in the discussion with the well I 'll be asking some questions about the budget side of things because I think it 's too high you know it 's a this particular resolution here it 's it 's a agree as to look for an alternative site and the development yeah because it 's yeah I understand that but I I mean I had from people that said on the hearings panel was such that you wouldn 't want to rule out looking at what the options are you know because it may well be that there 's a way more cost-effective option which will give people the the swimming pool that they really want and in may in fact be a more cost-effective option in the long run yeah if I may throw a chair to say if you look at the bishop down I think the thing is that it has to come back to us anyway so it 's not no no it 's not a question of cutting budgets it 's a question of what is going to produce the best result in the shortest space of time for a community that 's been waiting here a very long time and all we 're doing here is proceeding as we said with the geotech and analysis on cold pack so once you know then it 's happening at the same time yet this is asking for us to look at an alternative side and then all the future stuff right but it would be wrong not to say that there 's you know a sense that perhaps these things could be done in a different way and more quickly and more cost-effectively because the thing is based on the all help in pan 5.7 to fight for the night but I 'm questioning surprise a timeframe for this you know the whole information well presented to the company both in comes the other races in January so as soon as we can you can go back with work so it 's likely to be early to mid if you know take the investigation and also cause the estimator you 've a tongue in the end of December this year populate this time period we are dealing with this issue soon but given the fact that liras wasn 't something that would be addressed going forward as a question of the cheer not the board no okay because I just had questions around similar line to ref because I think there should be potentially uncoupled but and also therefore if they were uncoupled and actually the pool therefore by itself with this current users and all work together I think that this is noting the decision that it can 't_''_11335.3 be co-located it can 't the can 't_''_11338.81 we 're not going to reclassify part of deemed impacts so it can 't proceed would have actually reclassified into the part you can 't ask a question of I 'm sorry I 'm sorry might but you know I understand where you 're getting to but it 's not something that you can put to staff on this paper I understand I 'm just concerned by 2 where it says we 're looking for a tentative site and they 're therefore were coming out a complete option which potentially I don 't know the community says which is actually a just a pull on Denton path no I wouldn 't need reclassification but I 'm sorry it would be a complete anyway we will we will get a report bit from as a result of this paper and I think we should just leave it at that I was the nice I 'd say Yanni thank you previously when this has 're doing their own sort of review of how we got to this point and lessons and I just wanted if anyone 's talking to the local community board or the local community who are involved just to try and pick up you know how we can sort of avoid this long complicated process that can we not have this off the back of this paper because it the the the the project does not yet completed and there will be a review we 're doing reviews of all capital projects after they 're completed so this will be coming back for decisions and and once the project is underway then yes we can start interested in because I really want to see this project first see so I was really interested in I think everyone round the table save the page Yanni with the design and the location to ensure that the next steps of this project that doesn 't get repeated yeah and I don 't think we could waste time looking back right now at some stage in the future we will look back at the process and learn lessons from it that 's what we should always do after big projects glean and they might just I 'm ready for a strike what it looks like a straightforward procedure emotions yeah be put it 's been moved by counsel chin it 's been a seconded by Vicki back and well were you moving that the question be put oh sorry I thought you said procedural motion what 's the amendment to alternative so to identify a site and seconded by Aaron okay so I 'll put the amendment all those in favor say aye those opposed say no put up your hands for I one two three four five one two three four five six seven eight nine ten in a post one two three four that 's it 's lost and so I will put it scary so the words in alternative come out and so now I 'll put the full resolution all those in favor say aye those are place they know I should have allowed a debate prior to the putting of the amendment it 's the Martians been carried the resolutions a second August of this year particularly focus on the paragraph Li we can see the post paragraph emphasized that a council request stop you know to undertake the geotech investigation or coyopa to be undertaken as quickly as possible and also it is review paper 5 we request the chief executive report back a proposal to revoke the decision of 24 August last year and report back pater today you know councils the meeting on a process of precision as quickly as possible so in here I would like to particular emphasize to as quickly as possible what I mean of this as quickly possible which means this new facility will be the urgent need for a wider Holmby community in the residence second is in which reviewer stop the meeting agenda the process of paragraph and 5.7 to 513 on a meeting agenda that 's very logical and very reasonable and I would like to say angel releases the second August with requests to start give us the feedback as a proposal so even this a process per agent is the proposal so there 's a fantastic you as a local councillor I would like to working with the miniball the staff the wider Holmby community closely to follow the process of particular paragraph 5.72 513 for progress in the assessment of the site option as well as building after new facility in why the Holmby area as quickly as possible thank you who those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you and thank you very much to staff a scooter trading permit application pooling already this morning it was unlocking and and we 're looking at potentially allowing a greater distance and the geofencing public so it is far is some in up to the gondola potentially so we 've discussed it with lime and they 've agreed that agrees that 's great placement and parking there 's been some concern from people in the cycling community that all the cycle parks Linda being taken up with scooters we sort of 700 scooters packed in Central City in the mornings and potentially aimed keeping by creeks free for their intended purpose provisions around there 's something around safety and maintenance primarily appropriate with their course obstructions we can we can look at amending that to say you know high demand areas to reduce bunching we can look at metrics and kpi 's around that so yes the so it 's not to take up all block infrastructure regardless of the modality with scooters or yeah and so that the legal use of these wherever they are so there 's the potential for us to to say to a line listen you need to make sure that whatever information you give people means that they will be using deeds and a legal their occasional to use them in a legal way and they will if you know what that legal way is do we have any clarity over and things like bike lanes and stuff as well so can they be used and bike lanes they will be able to be on shared path with bike lanes in bike paths like a major cycle routes that are separated cycle routes cycle yeah the cycle ways as opposed to cycle lanes that kind of stuff what 's the clarity record that 's official yes we 've got we 've got in the permit provisions around and formed customs about where these can and can 't_''_12021.11 be used so yes great a lot of our MC I resolved our special vehicle lanes which would mean technically they can 't_''_12030.591 be without a year ago there was a changed the legislation to allow electric vehicles and special vehicle lanes I think the intent was bus lanes so we 're still looking at that and what 's a what 's appropriate and what 's not it would be something to be some interesting information together through the pilot but presently special vehicle lanes had you know defined for that particular class of vehicle which at the moment is cycles so these are not cycles and when it comes to the great areas that they are at the moment MDT a post on their website very very clearly that these scooters cannot the widows cannot be used on the road but we 've had advice and in lima pet advice from NZTA that it would probably be fine we there 's this gray area I know that at the moment and looking at legislation but we don 't have a timeframe on it we 're there is this gray area if there 's a council we 're endorsing this proposal and people are going with the lenient advice saying that they can be used on the road and something happens there 's a there 's a legal argument for you know driver of a car hits a scooter or those kind of things to be saying why she in CTA say they can 't_''_12105.84 be used on the road there would be analogous to the argument that the council provides roads it 's well in the parity oh that cars are allowed on the road I think striction will be unfortunate to suggest that there is council assuring trading permit their very clearly states that those two provisions about viability in that kind of way one of them what happens if it 's decided that actually we do this we say they 're going to be used legally in DTA finally come back so issue we 've got to be really careful on this one the odd it 's just 700 on the streets of Auckland or Christchurch we need to be really clear on this saying no then we 've got 700 on the footpath instead of spread between footpath and Road in at quite high speeds and that might change a decision we could make if we don 't have that legal clarity beforehand yeah and in detail you 've told you that they 're fine on the road but their website website still says that they 're not so we 've asked that of the operator and the operator yep I think that 's asked and answered um can I destroy your attention to the the change to 1 2 but it does allow for some specific things to be called out of councilors do want to so that instead of approving staff to assure it 's three months trading permit staff have a delegation to do that so it 's not something that has to come before the council but they 're asking us because this is new technology and it 's new for New Zealand new for Christchurch we would liked they in this case presented by Lyme technology to operate a shared electric scooter scheme on a trial basis in our staff to consider the permit application made by Lyme technology limited it notes that if the permit has approved terms and conditions can be imposed in accordance with the staff delegation under the public places bylaw and our staff take into account the following and respect of imposing any terms and conditions well I mean it seems to me that there 's a general agreement that would like to see there that the scooters are utilized and that well the people who use them are told that they have to utilize them and and and accordance with the NZTA requirements so I don 't know if you want to come up with some wording that better defines there that would have required me sergeant most people fall asleep when I 'm talking you can just join you can join the club we 'd also rate the operator advisors the provides provides the operator provides advice advice and well from NZTA as to what is it we they sorry legally use NZTA can you just find me wording in the actual document itself and copy it yeah like a be that here 's something to do with satisfactory reports from the referees some consume overseas about some of the operation and I know that we haven 't contacted the referee cities yet and I 'd quite like to make sure that it 's done before we sign off on us yeah yeah but taking with three chicks obviously subject to the concept being approved by council so we 're happy either way but so so you might want to be the CEO sighs that much that staff want to take and reproduce so it 's just a three note staff undertaker III will undertake reef rejects and yep sorry that Pauline was next to people top speed of your car is under 90 200 kilometers now that doesn 't even mean that you can go so the same rules apply in terms of in limits we reported top-speed depend on weight in battery charge so during the course of the day that 's likely to decrease depending on your size and students like to speak good lately no I can 't write Yanni just I just wondered like can cities becoming quite popular I can see the attraction and scooters versus bicycles just in terms of infrastructure design bus stops for example we are we looking at sort of provision for you know where they go in terms of just having sure that our infrastructure can actually cope and if so how are we doing that do operations staff just before this and we suspect that you know this is something we 're gonna see more of in the future and they sort of defined its little vehicles or the sort of mid speed vehicle range and we 're really fortunate that a lot of the infrastructure we 've put in over the last five years supportive and accommodating off these types of vehicles but there is work that I think we could do to have a look really closely at some of their design standards and the way we 're doing things to make sure they fit for purpose in the future so just thinking of like areas where bus residents because of you know the congestion of the buses and the narrow footpaths the implications of these going and there is there gonna be restrictions or ways to deal with that if it becomes an issue I think we 'd probably need to look at you know specific issues like that on a on a case-by-case basis it 's not being familiar with that particular issue sort of refer to operations engineers and look at solutions we have some of that be telling me and tell you like the record and bus you know please please don 't know seriously seriously it is now nearly quarter to one and just the fun I 'll get to we 'll get to debate in a minute but so you can raise all of these issues what 's not really to buy it I just want to ensure that you know it 's not relevant it 's up to the operator we 've already heard from the operator they 're going to click them every night just in regards to advertising so do we have anything at the moment that restricts what thing which was the noise issue that was raised so obviously other places around the overseas I 've had some issues with it making a noise if people try and temper with it I think it 's threatened to call the police in alarm so just in terms of the alarms the noise and the point that the mayor made which i think is actually really important and when you I came I think they actually said that there was a setting where it actually made a sort of noise to let people know a bell in its lights when it 's what we heard before yeah yeah but I mean the bells cut that requires people using it so there 's no ability to have a small sound Gina Rose when it 's actually in use we 'll be using them and what make noise are their work they 're not moving or and I won 't move by themselves so will require an operator to move them would arise about that there 's no noise pollution equally there 's no emissions because the battery I think is a the street on the person to actually be respectful of others and I don 't think it 's a measure that we can I 'm sure that people of Christchurch will be respectful and using those it 's the I mean that was the issue that we 've had with cyclists I mean cyclists don 't have to have bells and I mean I walk around Hagley Park Wrigley and that 's um yeah it 's very interesting when they fly by and unexpectedly but I think he scooters will be in a different model that might did you have a question so just the bottom three were working with now not the top three we would we would suggest retaining the original two and three so if they even became four and five two and three become four and five once the pilots done and we actually make a final decision based on the pilot where does that decision-making lawyers that were councils we 'd follow some of the process I think there the delegation would be wanting to keep the SE committee end in with the pilot I clarify things obviously with a push back you have to be on the road you have to wear helmut these scooters you can be you can be on the Fotolia be on the road and we 're helmet these issues you can be on the footpath you can be on the road without a helmet doing 27 KZ now okay and we 're obviously and seen all the issues with helmet Dewey well obviously in some park users helmets and potentially exposes them we were to encourage people to that 's about it sir sorry just because I mean there 's going to be quite a bit of time involved doing the monitoring and evaluation which is really good and I think it needs to be really well assist which is good and so there 's a lot of staff time and some costs involved in these and yet the trial permit though the payment for the trial we 're not charging them for it so wouldn 't we be charging them for these currently working through the costs of the permit we don 't have a lot of guidance will be some staff time and we look to recoup as much of that through a permit fee as possible but we will be doing it there we there we both it could be it could be you know a few months down the road we 'll have enough intelligence from how much monitoring goes on to providing support as well obviously the council has a strategic priority to encourage alternative forms of transport including active in public it does but we 've already decided that we don 't want to subsidize that kind of thing right and so putting in the infrastructure and stuff is there subsidy to the company no putting in its plot suggesting that putting in cycling infrastructure as a subsidy to cycling companies actually that would be public use in the top of infrastructure with something to blame their backs upon all right okay so that the motion has been moved and seconded so Vicki in that case I 'll speak I think this is exactly the sort of thing that Christchurch City is not as open to I mean we we pride ourselves as clean zero emission somebody wants to try something that looks like fun that fits in completely with what we 're doing with transport we 've done autonomous electric vehicles we have flying cars and Canterbury we have we want to look at different transport modes because we know they 're coming at us and here 's somebody coming at who 's actually said to sit right through the whole council meeting for what she should just get the betterment anyway the new transport mode that he wants to try and Christchurch and Auckland okay that makes some mistakes but that 's right it will work really well in Christchurch I think this is fun and we should just welcome it with open arms it 's a three month trial if it goes horribly wrong and it goes horribly wrong I 'm not sure what could possibly go wrong with it but we are open to these possibilities I think it 's great that he 's come to Christchurch and I 'm really looking forward to having a go on one of these things Sarah there Mike but I 've got a really good idea but I can 't endorse this today as I certainly don 't have legal clarity over where they can be used I think they have great potential but I don 't want seven hundred and maybe fifteen hundred and the Burton crisis that only on the footpads and not able to be used like normal scooters and skateboards on the side of the road like light bikes are remember that unites bikes needed special legislation to allow them on the road there 's also an equity issue here low socio-economic areas of the city will not be as attractive as a commercial proposition not only due to the 30 cents per minute price that 's 18 an hour but because you need both a smart phone and a credit card to be able to use the scooters as a shared mobility scheme I 'm sorry they won 't be an opportunity for all strategically as a city we have not looked at whether there is space for both a commercially by Scooter scheme and a bike share scheme and if not which would be the best locals interests having read some of the online commentary around the use of a scooter providers and other cities I also can 't vote in principle in favor and principle today if we haven 't already chipped with the referees that they 've provided I mean I do live the idea of these there 's just not enough clarity for me to be able to make that decision today thank you Mike really good now over cities just wake up in the morning with some other companies they 've actually coming overnight and just put scooters or bikes everywhere so this is actually is an exciting time for Christchurch and I look forward to seeing how the pilot works I do have some concerns now having 700 scooters being able to be ridden on the footpath or on the road without a helmet it does raise a lot of safety issues and when it comes to the road user rules the land transport Act and information on New Zealand Transport agencies website you know leads you down different paths with different outcomes you know some size Road only some say is a very very gray area in perhaps I guess the arrival of so many scooters and both Christchurch and Auckland may actually get this gray area sorted out a bit sooner rather than late later but hopefully you know it won 't be too late for some people when they 're actually going to be going at high speeds and actually a vulnerable environment one of the things that it does consume me we see a scooters as a PT option it 's allowing people to make that last mile of their journey and as a council I think we need to decide how important PT is to us in the city while we 're quickly we can know that public transport should be seen as a social service that is affordable twice we 're about to see Christchurch is last PT mol option become an unaffordable option for many of our residents and vision and quality PT is extremely important and perhaps it 's time for the council to step up and provide its own PT bike share they actually puts people first in Aaron term Yanni sorry around her and to me overall this is going to be sufficient sufficiently safe and there 's the safeguards here in terms of if it doesn 't work that in fact that the any breach would be will be terminated and Camryn has assured us today that he 's going to work with counsel and counsel staff clearly are working with him to make sure this does work so I think it 's important that we don 't throw in a hold of a red tape and in stopped us there 's no question at all with a new technology in fact these electric scooters are coming whether we 're ready or not and I think it 's great we are working with the lime so that effect we get something that will be as Vickie was indicating really good for it for our city and I think in a fin effect that it should be part of the PT options and we need to look at ways that we can can utilize it that way so I 'm certainly strongly in support that we undertake it 's more than a whole pilot for us ok I think it 's a fantastic opportunity it supports for a three-month trial it 's only three months and we will learn things from it but with we 're going to we 're going to give it a go it supports our strategic priorities of increasing active transport and also to achieve a vibrant and exciting in a city city so it will bring young people out and about we are concerned about obesity we were concerned about screens it will bring more people onto the streets which has the the wonderful effect of having people on the streets which means that we people feel safer they filled it they 're part of a community and it 's working in the u.s. which is probably the most libelous country in the world so let 's be a little young ink for me I did a bit of research last week and had a look at these in action and I did note that Santa Monica have banned them and yet in Venice they 're flourishing so right next door to each other you 've my city looking a wee bit messy and being a little bit chaotic and posters on lampposts and people riding bikes everywhere that 's the kind of city I 'd like to live in but that 's not the city everyone wants to live in so we should expect some feedback around people dumping these in the wrong place I hope that water soluble code man will get jumped into the river and things but in a three-month period we will get to see how the Christchurch behavior of these goes the worst case scenario is someone would die because you can write them on the road with no helmet and they do 27k an hour and if you you know have a mishap with a bus or a truck or another vehicle that could be the worst case scenario it doesn 't mean it will be because when you google excellence on scooters they 're not that bad it 's usually a few grazes and things and the funniest part watches when people hop on them and the minutes of run out and it starts to die and then on them that 's really really funny to watch but they are literally if you get in Venice Boulevard now there 's six in every block they are everywhere and they 're incredibly popular isn 't populous there 's lots of them is quite a lot of people on them they 're not in other parts of LA there was none in Hollywood there 's none in downtown there was none and Anaheim they were all in the beach districts so they were suited to a particular area and so it 'll be an interesting trial to see I 'm not saying it 's kind of working with saying it 's not gonna work but it 'll be very interesting to see if it does work in Christchurch but I don 't mind the chaos exciting I think to say that it 's going to limit those that can 't afford it so therefore we shouldn 't do is short-sighted we 've got public transport this won 't stop us looking at our public transport I 'm trying to improve it but I think it 'll be wonderful if more cars outside the central Mile and came in on scooters I think it 's outstanding with regards to the danger this morning I saw a pedestrian hit by a car on cash or more Colombo Street intersection which is generally pedestrian I saw a cyclist hurt at the roundabout a Dyess Pass Road and some Taurus roads earlier this week so you know there are things that happen on a roads which are up to that those that are honoured to behave and be respectful so we can 't control that but to say a lot all these what things do put these barriers up because these people can come anyway so I think it 's great that our staff are going to be working with these guys and try and get it those teething problems which are going to happen there 's no question about that to just try and manage those so we get a really good outcome for another option of public transport or commercial transfer but electric and taking those problems out and taking the question of the environment and bringing it for the forefront I would be kind of detrimental to having electrics you know silent and quiet as that you have 700 scooters running around the central city humming to warn people are coming so unique scent you have cyclist whistling would be lovely wouldn 't it so I just that the barrels will just be used by those users is they should be on bikes etc I 'm really looking forward to the challenge that we have with this over the next three months thank you sorry Yanni it 's really interesting looking at where we 're going as a city and I guess where the world is going 19 1997 council put an amendment to its crush it study public places and signs by law that no person shall play any game or ride in or upon any toboggan cart Charlie 's skateboard roller skate or similar device in any road or public place in such a manner at such time that may cause damage to property owned by Council or may cause annoyance danger or inconvenience to residents or members of the public in the vicinity and then went on to actually prohibit the use of skateboards but not all those other devices in certain areas and I think for someone who was around back then it 's actually really interesting to see we 're progressing now in terms of skating and and scooters and you know the end of the day crush it as a flat city this is one of the best places in the world to skate scooter or cycle and so I think it 's really exciting that we 're getting this new technology coming in I can see these being incredibly popular and I think it does raise the question in terms about urban design and infrastructure design standards how are we catering for this because the concerns have been raised are valid in terms of safety in terms of the mixture of vehicles and things that are vehicle like but but obviously don 't afford the same level of protection for the for the riders so you know I just think this is great that we 're trialing it here I welcome this coming to our city I think the issues in terms of where 're used is really important and hopefully we can we can deal with that because we 're doing the trial but you know I think people will be really excited about this I think this is definitely the way of the future and I think you know this is something that we should embrace so well I absolutely love it and I think it 's a fantastic idea actually some of the reasons why people were concerned or actually the reasons I 'm so looking forward to and it 's the you don 't have to wear a helmet all of the evidence shows that wearing a helmet puts you at far greater risk than not wearing a helmet and that 's because people assume that if you 're wearing a helmet that you 're safer than you are and you know it 's just it does seem to me that this is I don 't feel the same way about children I think children should wear a helmet but I think that from this is for eighteen year olds and over and it 's crystal clear you know and at some risks but also have some fun I agree that the highest speed that it can travel it has not the speed it will normally go in I know that there are cyclists who so I call it faster than 30 K is an hour and the 30 K area that we have for other vehicles and I hear I mean you 've seen it and I 've seen it right throughout the through throughout the the parks and places like this so I just think it will take off I think it will do really really well and I 'm really looking forward to welcoming Lyme technology officially to the city David my general support to this proposal as well and and I having spent a few weeks in Europe recently I was almost cleaned up or killa bike and interested and I do agree with this philosophy of helmets you know in all the European cities no one wears helmets and there are very few instances of any serious injury hundreds of thousands of bikes wreck outside the Amsterdam railway station and it would literally be probably with bikes I didn 't see a lot of electric scooters on the continent but they they were about in some areas and they 're starting to take off so I think we 've got to move with with technology but I certainly think the helmet issue is one that 's going to need some resolution because I don 't think scooters will be required to wear helmets and there 's some interesting observations good so Pauline would you like to wrap it up to prostitutes but if you look at the geographical area that these things are going to cover from South Shores it 's a massive area and I know they 'll be in hubs within that area as we think and the other thing we haven 't touched on is I think they 'll be really good for tourism here like in 19 an hour it 's might take them for an hour but for our users so probably use them for their end of commute particularly to fill helpfully we steam bus exchange so and I think the safety features and the controls that will be well-being and what the users into the wider public will be taken care of a have faith in abuse so yep I 'm innocent of this trial and look forward to seeing how it goes and also hearing it go I 'm one of the counselors just highlighted that the words three months have disappeared from the trial thing so you just throw in three months and that way it 's going to come back through Council anyway I know I could try I personally would approve a longer trial and I wonder whether well yeah well I mean we can 't change the resolution I mean I could leave it out and because it wasn 't under there when we were debating it and no one pointed it out to me until I just read an email which I shouldn 't have done so I personally would be more than happy to well anyway look it 's it 's that 's three months and in that time people can come back for a for a further you know report back so I 'll put the motion all those in two abstentions okay Templeton in Davidson all right so it was carried welcome good news Origen I think that brings us to the conclusion of the meeting yes so I declare the meeting closed you

    "text": "to trading human application David moved by Pauline seconded by are there any questions for staff already I think it 's really good people like that proposed subscription right this morning it was a door unlocking 30 it may be other other pricing models that were and and we 're looking at potentially allowing a greater distance and the geofencing to make things public so it 's far as um as far is sort of Sumner in up to the gondola potentially so we 've discussed it with lime and they 've agree that agrees that 's great [Music] placement in parking there 's been some concern from people in the cycling community that all the cycle parks will end up being taken up with scooters we sort of 700 screw dispatch in Central City in the mornings potentially end keeping by creeks free for their intended purpose able to go on that I think we head around there is something around safety and maintenance prime primarily the payment sort of concerned with not placing them in appropriate course obstructions we can we can look at amending that to say look at metrics and kpi 's around that so yes that so it 's not to take up all block scooters or yeah and so that the legal use of these wherever they are so there 's the potential for us to to say to a line listen you need to make sure that whatever information you give people means that they will be using these in a legal there occasionally use them in a legal way and there will little you know what that legal way is do we have any clarity over and things like bike lanes and stuff as well so can they be used and bike lanes they will be able to be on shared path but bike lanes in bike paths like a major cycle routes that are separated cycle routes cycle yeah the cycle ways as opposed to cycle lanes that kind of stuff what 's the clarity record that 's official vehicle lanes which is specified for bicycles only I think yes we 've got we 've got in the permit provisions around and from customs about where these can and can 't_''_185.09 hours are resolved ere special vehicle lanes which would mean technically they can 't_''_194.6 be out a year ago there was a changed the legislation to allow electric vehicles and special vehicle lanes I think the intent was bus lanes so we 're still looking at that and what 's what 's appropriate and what 's not it would be something to be some interesting information together through the pilot but presently special vehicle lanes are you know defined for that particular class of vehicle which at the moment is cycles so these are not cycles okay and when it comes to the great areas that they are at the moment so MDTA post on their website very very clearly that East scooters cannot the widows cannot be used on the road but we 've had advice and in lima pet advice from NZTA that it would probably be fine we 're there 's this gray area I know that the government are doing their work on low powered vehicles at the moment and looking at legislation but we don 't have a time frame on it where there is endorsing this proposal and people are going with the lenient advice saying that they can be used on the road and something happens there 's a there 's a legal argument for you know driver of a car hits a scooter or those kind of things to be saying white sheet in CTA say they can 't_''_269.84 be used on the road there would be analogous to the argument that the council provides roads as well in the para tí that cars are allowed on the road I think striction will be unfortunate to suggest that there is council assuring trading permit there very clearly states that those two provisions about viability in that kind of way one of them what happens if it 's decided that actually we do this we say they 're going to be used legally in DTA finally come back so issue we 've got to be really careful on this one the odd one here or there hasn 't been a problem but it 's just 700 on the streets of Auckland or Christchurch we need to be really clear on this we 're instead of spread between footpaths and rows in it quite high speeds and that might change a decision we could make so if we don 't have that legal clarity beforehand yeah and in detail you 've told you that they 're fine on the road but their website website still says that they 're not so we 've asked that of the operator and the operator NZTA yep I think that 's asked and answered um can I destroy your attention to the the change to one and two but it does allow for some specific things to be called out of councilors do want to so that instead of approving staff to assure it 's three months trading permit staff have a delegation to do that so it 's not something that has to come before the council but they 're asking us because this is new technology and it 's new for New Zealand new for Christchurch we would liked they would like us to give an approval to the concept in this case presented by Lyme technology to operate a shared electric scooter scheme on a made by Lyme technology limited it notes that if the permit has approved terms and conditions can be imposed in accordance with the staff delegation under the public places bylaw and our staff take into account the following and respect of imposing any terms and conditions well I mean it seems to me that there 's a general agreement that would like to see there that the scooters are utilized and that well the people who use them are told that they have to utilize them and and and accordance with the NZTA requirements so I don 't know if you want to come up with some wording that better defines their that would have required me sergeant most people fall asleep when I 'm talking you can just join you can join the club we did also the operator advisors the provides provides the operator provides advice advice and well from NZTA as to what is it we they sorry legally use legal and approved under standards or definition city up by NZTA can you just find me wording in the actual document itself and copy it yeah like reports from the referees some consume overseas about some of the operation and I know that we haven 't contacted the periphery cities yet and I 'd quite like to make sure that it 's done before we sign off on us yeah but taking three chicks obviously subject to the concept being approved by council so we 're happy either way but we 'll be under stacking so you might want to be the CSA 's that much that staff want to take and refridge ik 's delegation or executing yeah so it 's just a three nice stuff undertaker III will undertake referee cheeks and yep sorry there Pauline was next to a question about the speed of your car is hundred eighty two hundred kilometers now that doesn 't even mean you can go fast so and the same rules apply in terms of safety in in any limits top speed will depend on weight in battery charge the course of the day it 's likely to decrease also to be new on your film in Yanni I haven 't got a question on speeds like to I just wondered like can cities becoming quite popular I can see the attraction and scooters versus bicycles just in terms of infrastructure design bus stops for example we are we looking at sort of provision for you know where they go in terms of just having sure that our infrastructure can actually cope and if so how are we doing that do operations staff just before this and we suspect that yeah this is something we 're gonna see more and more of in the future and they sort of defined its little vehicles or the sort of mid speed vehicle range and we 're really fortunate that a lot of the infrastructure we 've put in over the last five years supportive and accommodating of these types of vehicles but there is work that I think we can do to have a look really closely at some of their design standards in a way we 're doing things to make sure they fit for purpose in the future so just thinking about areas where bus stops for example where we 're getting huge complaints from residents because of footpaths the implications of these going and there is there gonna be restrictions or ways to deal with that if it becomes an issue I think we 'd probably need to look at you know specific issues like that on a on a case-by-case basis it 's not being familiar with that particular issue I 'd sort of refer to operations engineers and look at solutions we have some of them II tellingly in restricting some obligations to tell you like the record and bus you know please please don 't no seriously seriously it is now nearly quarter to one and just a file you 'll get to will get to debate in a minute but so you can raise all of these issues what 's not really debate I just want to ensure that you know it 's not relevant it 's up to the operator we 've already heard from the operator they 're gonna click them every night in regards to advertising so do we have anything that 's permanent that restricts what can be advertised and then I 'm sorry there was one other thing other places around the oversees I 've had some issues with it making a noise if people try and temper with it I think it 's threatened to call the police in alarm so just in terms of the alarms the noise and the point that the mayor made which i think is actually really important and when you I came I think they actually said that there was a setting where it actually made a sort of noise to let people know a bell and it 's lights when it 's what we heard before yeah yeah but I mean the bells quite that requires people using it so there 's no ability to have a small sound Gina Rose when it 's actually in use these people will be using them and what make noise are their work they 're not moving or and I won 't move by themselves so will require an operator to move them wouldn 't you rise about that there 's no noise pollution equally there 's no emissions because the battery-powered I think is a good one it does before walking fast be respectful of others and I don 't think it 's a measure that we can I 'm sure that people of Christchurch will be respectful and using those it 's the I mean that was the issue that we 've had with cyclists I mean cyclists don 't have to have bells and I mean I walk around Hagley Park Wrigley and that 's um yeah it 's very interesting when they fly by and unexpectedly but I think he scooters will be in a different model that Mike did you have a question so just the bottom three were working with now not the top three we would we would suggest retaining the original two and three so if they even became four and five two and three become four and five once the pilots done and we actually make a fara decision based on the pilot where does that decision-making lawyers that were councils I would follow some of the process I think they 're the delegation would be wanting to keep the se committee end when it came to a final decision committees in with the there was issues resolved and just to clarify things obviously with a pushbike you have to be on the road you have to wear a helmet these issues you can be on the footpath you can be on the road without a helmet doing 27 cars an hour and we 're obviously and seen all the issues with helmet Dewey well obviously in some park users helmets and potentially exposes them we were to encourage people to that 's about it sir sorry just because I mean there 's going to be quite a bit of time involved doing the monitoring and evaluation which is really good and I think it needs to be really well assist which is good and so there 's a lot of staff time and some costs involved in these and yet the trial permit though the payment for the trial we 're not charging them for it so wouldn 't we be charging them for these currently working through the costs of the permit we don 't have a lot of guidance around the costs for these types of parents agreed there will be of that through a permit for you as possible but we will be doing it we both it could be it could be you know a few months down the road we 'll have enough intelligence from how much monitoring goes on to accurately recruiting support as well obviously the council has a stretch at karate to encourage alternative forms of transport including active in it does that we 've already decided that we don 't want to subsidize right in so putting in the infrastructure and stuff is there subsidy to the company no putting in its existing it putting in cycling infrastructure as a subsidy to cycling companies actually there were pieces of public use in the top of infrastructure right okay so that the motion has been moved and seconded so the key in that case I 'll speak I think this is exactly the sort of thing that Christchurch City is not as open to I mean we we pride ourselves as a city of opportunity where anything is possible this is clean zero emission somebody wants to try something that looks like fun that fits 've done autonomous electric vehicles we have flying cars and Canterbury we have we want to look at different transport modes because we know they 're coming at us and here 's somebody coming at who 's actually said to sit right through the whole council meeting for what she should just get the betterment anyway the new transport mode that he wants to try and Christchurch and Auckland okay that makes some mistakes but that 's right it will work really well in Christchurch I think this is fun and we should just welcome it with open arms it 's a three month trial if it goes horribly wrong and it goes horribly wrong I 'm not sure what could possibly go wrong with it but we are open to these possibilities I think it 's great that he 's come to Christchurch and I 'm really looking forward to having a go on one of these things Sarah there Mike but I 've got reservations I think they 're having a trial it 's a really good idea but I can 't endorse this today as I certainly used I think they have great potential but I don 't want seven hundred and maybe fifteen hundred and abettin Christ which if that only on the footpads and not able to be used like normal scooters and skateboards on the side of the road like light bikes are remember that unites bikes needed special legislation to allow them on the road there 's also an equity issue here low socio-economic areas of the city will not be as attractive as a commercial proposition not only due to the 30 cents per minute price that 's 18 an hour but because you need both a smart phone and a credit card to be able to use the scooters is a shared mobility scheme I 'm sorry they won 't be an opportunity for all strategically as a city we have not looked at whether there is space for both a commercially by Scooter scheme and a bike share scheme and if not which would be the best outcome for the city as a transport option for both locals interests having read some of the online commentary around the use of vote in principle in favor and principle today if we haven 't already chipped with the referees that they 've provided I mean I do live the idea of these there 's just not enough clarity for me to be able to make that decision today thank you Mike really good now over cities just wake up in the morning with some of the companies they 've actually coming overnight and just put scooters or bikes everywhere so this is actually is an exciting time for Christchurch and I look forward to seeing how the pilot works I do have some concerns now having 700 scooters being able to be ridden on the footpath or on the road without a helmet it does raise a lot of safety issues and when it comes to the little scooters road user rules the land transport Act and information on New Zealand transport agencies website you know leads you down different paths with different outcomes you know some size Road only some say footpath I only wrote a footpath registration driver 's license is a very very gray area in perhaps I guess Auckland may actually get this gray area sorted out a bit sooner rather than late later but hopefully you know it won 't be too late for some people when they 're actually going to be going at high speeds and actually a vulnerable environment one of the things that it does consume me we see a scooters as a PT option it 's allowing people to make that last mile of their journey and as a council I think we need to decide how important PT is to us in the city while we 're quickly ek I know that public transport should be seen as a social service that is affordable twice we 're about to see Christchurch is last PT mol option become an unaffordable option for many of our residents and vision and quality PT is extremely important and perhaps it 's time for the council to step up and provide its own PT bike share they actually puts people first in Aaron term Yanni sorry all day some key for me about the safety issues around her and to me overall this is going to in terms of if it doesn 't work that in fact that the any breach would be will be terminated and Camryn has assured us today that he 's going to work with counsel and counsel staff clearly are working with him to make sure this does work so I think it 's important that we don 't throw in a hold of a red tape and in stopped us there 's no question at all with a new technology in fact these electric scooters are coming whether we 're ready or not and I think it 's great we are working with the lime so that effect we get something that will be as Vickie was indicating really good for it for our city and I think in a fit in effect it should be part of the PT options and we need to look at ways that we can can utilize it that way so I 'm certainly strongly in support that we undertake it 's more than a than a trial it 's it 's it 's a whole pilot for us okay I think it 's 's only three months and we will learn things from it but with we 're going to we 're gonna give it a go it supports their strategic priorities of increasing active transport and also to achieve a vibrant and exciting in a city city so it will bring young people out and about we are concerned about obesity we were concerned about screens it will bring more people onto the streets which has the the wonderful effect of having people on the streets which means that we people feel safer they filled it they 're part of a community and it 's working in the u.s. which is probably the most libelous country in the world so let 's be accountable to new ideas new people new ways of doing things one young yank for me I did a bit of research last week and had a look at these in action and I did note that Santa Monica have banned them and you in Venice they 're flourishing so right next door to each other you 've got the two universes going on I don 't mind my bit chaotic and posters on lampposts and people riding bikes everywhere that 's the kind of city I 'd like to live in but that 's not the city everyone wants to live in so we should expect some feedback around people dumping these in the wrong place I hope that water soluble one will get jumped into the river and things but in a three-month period we will get to see how the Christchurch behavior of these goes the worst-case scenario is someone would die because you can write them on the road with no helmet and they do 27k an hour and if you you know have a mishap with a bus or a truck or another vehicle that could be the worst-case scenario it doesn 't mean it will be because when you google excellence on scooters they 're not that bad it 's usually a few grazes and things and the funniest part Watchers when people hop on them in the minutes of run out and it starts to die and then they try and scoot and it just starts locking up on them that 's you get in Venice Boulevard now there 's six in every block they are everywhere and they 're incredibly popular isn 't populous there 's a lot of them it 's quite a lot of people on them they 're not in other parts of LA there was none in Hollywood there 's none in downtown there was none and Anaheim they were all in the beach districts so they were suited to a particular area and so it 'll be an interesting trial to see I 'm not saying it 's kind of working what saying it 's not gonna work but it 'll be very interesting to see if it does work in Christchurch but I don 't mind the chaos exciting I think to say that it 's going

Colombo Street intersection which was generally pedestrian I saw a cyclist hurt at the roundabout adaiah spaz road and Taurus roads earlier this week so you know there are things that happen on our roads which are up to that those that are honored to behave and be respectful so we can 't control that but to say oh look all these what things it 's put these barriers up because these people can come anyway so I think it 's great that our staff are going to be working with these guys and try and get it those teething problems which are going to happen there 's no question about that just try and manage those so we get a really good outcome for another option of public transport or commercial transport but electric and taking those problems out and taking the question of the environment and bringing it for the forefront I think it 's really important to have them humming away would be kind of detrimental you have 700 scooters running around the Central City coming to warn people are coming so unique scent you have cyclists whistling would be lovely with that so I 'd suggest that the bells will just be used by those users is they should be on bikes etc I 'm really looking forward to the challenge that we have with this over the next three months thank you sorry Jonnie it 's really interesting looking at where we 're going as a city and I guess where the world is going in 19 1997 council put an amendment to its crush it study public places and signs by law that no person shall play any game arrived in or upon any toboggan cart Charlie 's skateboard roller skate or similar device in any Road or public place in such a manner at such time that may cause damage to property owned by council will may cause annoyance danger or inconvenience to resonance or members of the public in the vicinity and then went on to say that from time to time by resolution it could actually prohibit the use of and I think for someone who was around back then it 's actually really interesting to see what we 're producing now in terms of skating and and scooters and you know the end of the day crush it as a flat city this is one of the best places in the world to skate scooter

resolution because I don 't think scooters will be required to wear helmets and they 're probably more potentially so yes some interesting observations but you know our supporters okay so Pauling would you like to wrap it up to Christchurch but if you look at the geographical area that these things are going to cover from south shore to the airport the bottom of the hills it 's a massive area and I know they 'll be in hubs within that area as we think and the other thing we haven 't touched on is I think they 'll be really good for tourism here like 19 an hour its might take them for an hour but for our users they 'll probably use them for their end of commute particularly to feel helpful that we see and get will be really nice exchange so and I think the permit just to ensure that the safety and well-being of the users end to the wider public will be taken here away faith little beer juice so yep I 'm innocent of this trial and look forward to seeing how it goes I 'm one of the

    "text": "country so the Hornby library customer services and Southwest leisure center project just I 'm gonna I 'll get you to I mean we can take it as read but and I don 't know where there are

expediently identify an alternative site that says agree that staff implement the process is set out on paragraphs 5.7 to 5.30 so it just simply identifies them the body of the paper what the process is it 's a belts and braces approach which i think is very sensible under the circumstances so they 're Jimmy would you like to move this registers yeah my question is are we open to looking at not having these facilities co-located I mean certainly from my perspective having been involved in the hearings panel a couple of conclusions I came to was that the library could actually go on the current site and the budget was pretty overcooked when I been done so is that something that will be considered are you still going to progress with the big co-located option Ellucian previously talked about the colocation of the theater in from the community I 'm so still progressing down that pathway however I think it 's too high you know this particular resolution here it 's a agree as to look for an alternative site and the development yeah because it 's yeah I understand that but I I mean I must say that you know the feedback that I 've had from people that said on the hearings panel was such that you wouldn 't want to rule out looking at what the options are you know because it may well be that there 's a make way more cost-effective option which will give people the the swimming pool that they really want and in may in fact be a more cost-effective option in the long run yeah if I may throw a chair to say if you look at the Bishop Dell library I think that costs us a decent outcome the budget for the Lynwood pool has to come back to us anyway so it 's not no no it 's not a question of cutting budgets it 's a question of what is going to produce the best result in the shortest space of time for a community that 's been waiting here a very long time and all we 're doing here is proceeding as we said with the geotech analysis on coal Park so once again it 's happening at the same time yeah this is asking for us to look at an alternative site and then all the future stuff can come back to the council yeah yeah it 's right but it would be wrong not to say that there 's you know a sense that they perhaps these things could be done in a different way and more quickly and more cost-effectively because the thing is based on the all help in town so five point seven two five for the night but I 'm questioning is quite a time for this you know the whole information well presented to the company both in Council the other races in January with work so it 's likely to be if you know take the investigation and also cause the estimator give a tongue in the end of December this year popular this time period is we are just wondering soon but given the fact that liras is it something that would be addressed going forward as a question of the cheer not the board no because I just had questions around similar line to Rafe because I think there should be potentially uncoupled but and also therefore if they were uncoupled and actually the pool therefore by itself would be a much if actually it could fit end with this current users and all work together I think that this is noting the decision that it can 't_''_467.289 be co-located it can 't the can 't_''_470.8 we 're not going to reclassify part of deemed impacts so it can 't proceed okay another question think would have actually reclassified into the party you can 't ask that question of I 'm sorry I 'm sorry might but you know I understand where you 're getting to but it 's not something understand I 'm just concerned by 2 where it says we 're looking for a turn ative site and they therefore were coming out a complete option which potentially I don 't know the community says which is actually a just a pull on Denton path no I wouldn 't need reclassification but I 'm sorry it would be a complete anyway we will we will get a report bit from staff as a result of this paper and I think we should just leave it at that I was the nice I 'd say Yanni thank you previously when this has come back I think it was reference to staff we 're doing their own sort of review of how we got to this point and lessons and I just wanted if anyone 's talking to the local community board or the local community who are involved just to try and pick up you know how we can sort of avoid this long complicated process that can we not have this off the back of this paper because the the the the project does not yet completed and there capital projects after they 're completed so this will be coming back for decisions and and once the project is underway then yes we can start because I really want to see this project first see so I was really interested in I think everyone round the table Yanni with the design and location to ensure that the next steps of this project that doesn 't get repeated yeah and I don 't think we could waste time looking back right now at some stage in the future we will look back at the process and ask ourselves whether we could have done things better and learn lessons from it that 's what we should always do after big projects glean and Mike just I 'm really frustrate what it looks like a straightforward procedural motion yeah be put it 's been moved by counsel chin it 's been seconded by Vicki back and well were you moving that the question be pot oh sorry I thought you said procedural motion what 's the amendment to alternative so to identify a site and seconded by Aaron okay so I 'll opposed say no put up your hands for I one two three four five one two three four five six seven eight nine ten in opposed one two three four that 's it 's lost and so I will put it scary so the words in alternative come out and so now I 'll put the full resolution all those in favor say aye those are place they know I should have allowed a debate prior to the putting of the amendment it 's the Martians been carry the resolutions passed okay all right all right Jimmy this issue comes from eating on a second August of this year particularly focus on the paragraph three we can see the post paragraph emphasized then a council request stop you know to undertake a geotech investigation or coyopa to be undertaken as quickly as possible and also in this review paper 5 we request the chief executive report back a proposal to revoke the decision of 24 August last year and repo Peck painter today you know councils the meeting on a process of position as quickly as possible so in here as possible what I mean of this as quickly possible which means this new facility will be the urgent need for a wider Holmby community in the residence second is in which reviewer stopped the meeting agenda the process of paragraph and 5.72 513 on a meeting agenda that 's very logical and very reasonable and I would like to say releases the sacrum occurs with requests to start give us the free pay as a proposal so even this opposes per a traditional proposal so there 's a fantastic you know for this way so as a counselor for home be as a local counselor I would like to working with the committee board the staff the wider home be community closely to follow the process of particular paragraph for upon the seven to five hundred the thirteenth for progress in the assessment of the site option as well as building after new facility in why the home be area as quickly as possible thank you all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you and thank you very much to staff _"

    "text": "invite Paula Smith on a platter Ruth Rubin and Alan learn from the three zone committees to join us at the front of the table okay none of you is recognizable as L in them right okay thank you now you don 't apology groundwater protection one of the main issues at the moment for the same committee is the groundwater modeling that shown is groundwater from a district flowing underneath the modeling shows that there 's a high probability of the deeper Christchurch aquifer through ceilings of this water and it also predicts that it 'll affect particularly the north eastern sector at the moment principal focus has been on nitrate concentrations which predicted to increase why many district itself has some serious problems with nitrate concentrations in their groundwater has been in consultation with farmers in the area in the because of the modeling results the two joint meetings with the winery rezoning committee and after these meetings the crash zone committee commended the work being done by the woman my career is own committee in its targets for the consultation process with we 're area area is nitrate load has been proposed the stage approach requires that farmers in the area will eventually acquire even better than good management practice in order to eat the Tigers this was this is quite severe current modeling suggests that crushes drinking water and the affected areas in Christchurch City will rise slightly in the short to long term that will ultimately be less than 50 percent of the maximal maximum allowable value within the proposed targets consequently it 's unlikely to result no be presenting the information to the city committee next week in more detail groundwater storm water in streams the zone committee of the storm water quality which in turn improve the quality of last year that Christchurch don 't committee had a very successful public interaction if the meat in the middle event occurs reach and the storm water superhero was first used at this event I was going to be the t-shirt but this morning will be prisoned against again this year 's event and since then the logo has been used at many different events to the wrong zone committee members and the storm water a mobile storm water education resources probably on something that is like a trailer that can be located at public events it 'll be available to community groups schools and so on to try and educate the general public research shows that about 60% of Christchurch residents don 't actually realize that drains lead to screens and rivers and then mainly untreated to the sea better to restrict pollution of the stormwater through education rather than help to treat our rivers and streams and the result theater the fence at the top of the cliff rather than the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff face the zone committee would like to thank the Council for promoting the copper free brake pads motion the recent local government forum this was one of the stormwater programs at their zone committee initiated so we thank you very much for that and I hear it passed very successfully two of our committee were present at a recent field day for developers and contractors to address the problems with erosion and sediment from primarily reporters this is a particularly serious problem after the Port field day was the second such event we held on last year and was extremely well attended should heed that there 's recently been two significant fines imposed for breaches of the sediment control in Syria so as well as the carrot there is the big state and the Kashmir stream made the quarterfinals for the restoration party on Springs there 's a planting day the Saturday councillors would like to see some of the immediate steps funding the nature the zone committee is working with you came and application funding men on deck zone committee is floating a revival of the concept of the drylands Park the concept was first proposed way back in 1997 proposal was and I quote to capture the experience in broad vistas of formerly extensive primeval grasslands shrublands and woodlands in the canterbury plains the park would ensure the ongoing protection of the national the unique and new zealand dry grassland environment that would give a dry plant experience similar to the survivors the Delta States the American prairies or the South American Panthers bio test such as the last significant stands or very see close to christchurch would be included in the park some of the land there is already under an ecological heritage status we 're currently in conversation with the biodiversity Ranger he can in the least manager of the ekayon land about future opportunities for the park in the e Cane Lane staff of the Waimakariri River deputations to the zone committee recent imputations to the committee included from the East Lake Trust in the Haven Heath Coates who type trust the East Lake Trust were presenting their case for the East Lake in the red zone lively discussion after it 's a number of questions arose and these were addressed by the to trust mission members prison additional information was required by the same committee in the East Lake trust was going to make some of the submissions to regenerate the aim in Heathcoat estuary trust gave a presentation about the work of the trust one message to this council came out that came out of the discussions was that trust expressed a preference for the dual cycleway drive to pass through Charlesworth reserve adjacent to Humphries Drive rather the zone committee congratulated the trust on becoming an international Flyway site finally at the most recent meeting gates of the Christchurch City Council presented the results of the 2017 surface water quality monitoring report unfortunately the results confirm that the urban screen thank you very much I think probably because of the issues involved we 'll just we 'll start with this one and then have questions and then move on to the other two if that 's all right yeah new Vicky wood Vicky so oh gosh I 'm just mindful of the thought fact that we are time limited but also that we have got a water forum on Friday week tomorrow week yeah I will be very brief because I appreciate those and just in terms of the leaching of the nitrates under the Womack what area of land is actually involved in the why MEK District Council that 's responsible for that reasonably well defined by the modelling it 's what land area yes thank you given I just the research you really were telling us about regarding the nitrate concentrates in groundwater coming from the very last line in the written information that we 've got here relating to the Interzone groundwater nitrate issue I mean clearly this is something that we in Christ you 've got significant interesting given the inter zonal nature of the problem we don 't have the benefit of an update of the type you 've just given from the Waimakariri zone committing public feedback will be sort on the draft Waimakariri zip addendum for the solutions package in september what process or what type of avenues are there for that feedback are there public meetings will there be a formal submissions and hearings process what does public feedback look like and what are the processes for capturing it this is still up near at the moment but we 're talking about things like a walk-in day where we have both committees prison and people can walk in off the street and we 'll all be there to answer questions at the moment I mean there 's a large consultation process and that 's exactly what worries me we 've got an issue that affects Christ 's eulogy possibly to the same extent as a face Waimakariri we 're not involved in the consultation and the engagement to anything like the same degree excellence I guess my request really is can we just make sure that we as a council are kept informed of our opportunity to participate whether through our counselor representation on your committee or through these updates or whatever thank you and I think that the water formants also an opportunity we sat down with a cane which is the other partner and the Canterbury water management strategy and the and I think it will be really important that we you know bring Waimakariri you know into the picture because as you say that the strategies that they develop in relation to a much more immediate and pressing problem on their side of the river in relation to their groundwater they do they do I know that yeah Jonnie did you have a question yeah I mean I just was just really concerned around the silt roll-off last night I went for a walk along the hit cut River through closer to the ferry made side that they just can 't believe the color of the water and so it I just kind of wonder what we 're actually doing you 've said that two people were prosecuted yes it just seems to me like but initially after the fires I think we asked what was going on in the advice back we had was we haven 't seen it at an increased level then what would be normal so we don 't think there 's been a huge impact but just looking at the river and hearing from people that walk along the river they seem to think that there has been a significant impact of sediment and and stuff going into the river especially at that lower level so can you just give us any understanding of what other work we could do we should do to try and address that if that 's that 's been actively which was for contractors and developers who are developing things on the port hills to stop the statement getting them to the river duty okay so stuff is available out there and we 've had two being like do you think having actually an active joint monitoring and enforcement regime rather than those guidelines would be beneficial I mean it I just don 't know how much monitoring goes on that we should put on the water when we see the results from the survey thank you look at Paula Smith an excellent segue into excellent which it does not begin you the Port Hills all over the big signature and it 's affecting the Selwyn catchments as well right settlement issue and the other point I would make is that the majority of people who live in the base mention is owned if it will supply from the groundwater system City Council manages so we were affected by if there 's a risk associated nitrates our communities are affected as well anyway getting back to business since I last came on the 7th of June we 've had three meetings the first was in June on Governors Bay where we further explored forestry issues with both staff who provide advice about the new national standard for plantation forestry and from members of the public and will have an impact and result in amendments both to the regional and two you will crush you city council district clean mhm 17th of July our meeting was in Littleton and we had a paper about the perch springs of makes Peninsula a presentation by University of Canterbury volcanologist dr. Sam Hampton it was a very high level of community interest in this in this matter and from that we 're two recommendations mainly directed at council because the information that we were presented highlighted the risks and opportunities for the management of the recharge zone is for those groundwater systems and for a potential for problems with crisis City Council proposals for deep well injection of wastewater and also possibly opportunities for community water supply at okay and spay which might be cheaper and better possibly so and also at that meeting the zone committee allocated most of its 100,000 budget of immediate Stix funding to six projects across we also have resolved to have an annual funding round for one rather than just deal with these applications as they arrive because we are now at a point 've had since I last spoke to you was building this place one more 21st of August we we had a deputation from the leader of the akuti Valley project about the issue which is in the agenda about the fencing about many things one of which was that akuti Mele is a spawning site for lamprey and but also about the fencing at least an analogy which was an issue that would be a race before and I 'm pleased to be able to tell you that it has since been resolved at that meeting wasn 't clear that the fit new fence wants to be totally funded but since the apparently now is and the stock will be kept down a particular section of its Barnard reserved but we also talked about briefly about the crusher City Council 's global stormwater consent application and and we had a brief update on the council 's sites of ecological significance program next meeting is on the 18th of September coming up it 's an opera and the main topic will be the new seasons water quality monitoring results so we improvement with ekayon councillors and listen another couple of things that there have come up one was the akuti fence and another issue about trying to get some names on some of our streams on local roads on the bridges they 've they made us think a bit about this forum as a means of communicating with you this quarterly update report and this is our one and only opportunity to interact at a governance to governance level with you people and apart from excellent member councils tuner who is on our committee and just put a I 've just got a question little bit about why why was it the zone committees minutes stopped going to the AG committee and and because to me I mean I 'm even listen to the community board reports there 's a lot of interest in these water management thanks and this doesn 't seem like a particularly effective way to resolve things or we have no ability to organize hardly any ability to influence funding we can 't make submissions on you 're playing or leaving live it and I think there level of conversations not particularly effective so I 've just wonder where he might give that some thought ask yourselves do we add value what you do by doing this well the the only reason really to bring it here is that counselors had no line of sight that we are in a partnership with they can over the zone committees through the canterbury water management strategy and without reporting without a reporting line that brought all of the counselors around the table that didn 't seem to but i mean i agree that making deputations to committees isn 't actually the most I mean essentially it 's what you 're doing may isn 't the effective way of decision making no way but but that 's not what this is for this is to make sure that there is awareness in that there 's public awareness I mean a lot of the issues that you 've raised have ended up in the media because you have come and presented them to the council well I agree and and it seems to me that the water form that we have for that to occur and then if there 's a particular issue that wants to come out but I think I 'd rather also find a way of wrapping listen to the into the water forums that we 're having you know sort of bimonthly with them I can I 'm sorry we established a relationship with a keen and and started a government governance to governance meeting arrangement between councillors and commissioners at the time and subsequently it split into two and one month would be a water forum and in the following time but they 're only held every two months okay I can 't remember the exactly off the top of my head but and then the next two months it 's a it 's a generic one so it 's not another forum all the time but I mean it 's a perfectly valid point that 's been raised and I 've just seen that wouldn 't it be better to provide an inclusive way of bringing Mazzone committees into the water forum the next one is Friday week so just leave it with us then where do the minutes currently go obviously they come back to the committee to be reported back at its next meeting but those minutes currently get reported to eke an all the City Council in any formal way I don 't think they come to the City Council in any formal way my view is appropriate they come to the community board but it may well be that we consider bringing them to easy as well as Pauline has suggested so and he can do they go are they reported to the ECAM Council we meet in the same way with egain once every two or three months I think it 's not that we go to the meetings so it 's not okay and then a more specific question on the report itself the paragraph just before the the picture in the report that relates to sand Hamptons presentation on perch Springs there were two recommendations the first of which was that these findings be considered in decisions about the future management drinking water supplies particularly in Akane 's Bay and the second of which relates to providing Sam deep bore injection trials for the a corral wastewater disposal have you had as chair of the committee any response back from the City Council as to how those two recommendations have landed on how they 're going to be dealt with no the only communication we 've had has been from you so again it worries me that there are recommendations that have come from the committee which need to be picked up somewhere I don 't know here they got a process I 'm not sure where that you know the formal process for dealing with those recommendations but there are two things here that need to be picked up because they 're both important and I would hate to see those recommendations just disappear and not be picked up in any meaningful way particularly when there are community members that may well have become aware not least you this report of the second of those recommendations and therefore have a reasonable expectation that a well trusted person in the form of Sam Hampton will have some evaluation input into the results of the deep well injection which anyway we did have a briefing from Mike Burke at a community board meeting in a seminar last Monday and he did say in the conversation that Sam Hampton had actually been up at the the drilling site when they were removing a core sample so Sam has obviously already got a working relationship with the city the point that counsel tunas making though I think he 's responding to the actual report from the Banks Peninsula sewing committee which is to request that there 's a a specific role for him in terms of his own dependence and status at the University is it the deep one injection trial the zone committee quite rightly in response to a detailed and really interesting presentation have made a recommendation but as a member of the zone committee and as a member of this council I need to be confident that that will be picked up in some formal way so just well perhaps the the easiest way would be to simply and in receiving these reports note the request of the Banks Peninsula zone committee for requesting CCC consider providing Sam deep bore injection trials for the okra wastewater disposal in refer the matter to staff so I mean that way we 're noting that that 's your recommendation and we 're referring it to to the management of the organisation no no but I 'm trying to and you 're buying here we 're trying to find a solution to a particular problem that has been raised on this occasion that doesn 't solve the problem yes yes I 'm very very aware of this now we should have been in your report and then I could have taken some advice on what we might have been able to do but the perception that says Banks Peninsula Water Management Committee their committees themselves don 't give any input on okay all right well it might be another element that we will look at as well so thank you for your free and Frank disclosures in front of you wouldn 't have got this far without without coming to the council so all right so if I could just now hand over to the person who won to celebrate with you committee with the two governor 's it 's now which is pretty significant for those and I hope shouldn 't be any on the council the the team ohokay governor 's representatives of niter who this council Environment Canterbury councillors in seventh District Council the significance is that I guess to get a healthy lake there 's a couple of things need to be done serious improvements in their catchment itself and also some interventions some action in the lake itself it 's always been very very clear to the design committee and indeed to others that anything in the lake needs to be led by night aho and I guess that leadership is through the government so it 's very significant because the zone committee has focused its actions on trying to get the game lifted in terms of particularly farming indication so it 's very significant to have the Tiwi who are Co governors in the zone committee having a delightfully full and frank communication in conversation actually on the Mirai on the shore of T WA the only other thing I want to touch on is I the design committee community members will start from next week so community members on design committee serve three-year terms so at the end of this year there will be different numbers of community members terms across all of the teams on committees that effectively come up for that first and so there 's a prices for seeking expressions of interest from anyone who has an interest in water in particular signs to apply and in this process a selection process and certainly a number of counselors have been involved in in the past so the refresh process I guess is launched to start next week and these expressions of interest take a final date for those in October so I would encourage all of think of people who would be interested in joining zone committees encourage them to apply because the strength of zone committees is in that community members and it 's important to give a lot of people apply them so that section working group the counselors are to actually give a good choice I celebrate very good there any questions all right so I 've got no I 'm just wondering whether we want to add another resolution I was just busy trying to word it but something along the lines of request staff to meet what the zone committee representatives and develop a a mechanism for ensuring that ensuring yeah that it 's kind of like we take input from the community boards when we 're doing that LTP and the annual plans so it 's kind of like ensuring that the appropriate engagement or appropriate [Music] but but it 's it 's it 's information request but it 's also they want to important of the and to decisions around the the plans that we make in terms of allocation of funding for particular things you know so for ensuring that for ensuring appropriate and input into the into relevant council decision-making processes so as it 's just to just try and I mean I 'm not trying to write the solution I 'm just trying to write the the wording for getting it anyway if we ask them to meet with throne committee representatives to develop a mechanism for ensuring appropriate important relevant council 'll be the we need you to come back December and I would have want to do that report back by the end of well report back by the end of November so that way we could actually have a paper that ties on what the amazing I don 't know well I was just trying to think of a we are a committee of you yeah we are your committee this is a governance role that we are in and it 's not a staff to staffing yeah we 're becoming really frustrated because we have no ability to influence staff I 'm hearing these I 'm definitely hearing it so if we leave it at the representatives then that can be the council Council or representatives and the the chairs so and I don 't think we need to just say more than that would just leave it to the to the proper conversations having and I 'm just also want to kind of almost direct ourselves to discuss this at the water forum next week as well there we 've got a bit of a gap we 'm wondering if we want to do something about that do they want to report through here as well yeah yeah what 's it your series our representative on the regional one but you know it 's um who 'd she is the regional one okay um can I discuss the regional AG committee has a representative on the regional committee but they kind of deal with pain Canterbury issues is it right rather than specific okay a lot of the time we 're not very interested we get a report back from major designs at the regional matter with the committee meetings yeah and all the meetings are public in the minutes and everything are all just like the look I don 't want to kind of hold this up but I mean we can easily put this on the agenda for the for the water forum next week we don 't need a resolution to do that Andrew I think that 's a really good idea I think today 's presentations and the discussion that 's resulted from them is highlighted that there are some expression in terms the idea that we 've got governance bodies which are a governance body of council or a joint governance body of council that have got no realistic way of reporting into Council and reporting their resolutions into council in a formal sense does seem very unusual you know we wouldn 't have community boards the passed recommendations that then didn 't make a decision on them it appears that the recommendations coming out of the zone committees are dealt with by staff rather than us as governors if the mechanism is that we need to pick up those recommendations by way of passing resolutions at meetings like this so be it but I don 't think that was what was intended I think we 've actually through a number of conversations uncovered that the way for dealing with these resolutions these recommendations coming out of the zone committees is less-than-ideal also to have committees that aren 't able to submit on council policy documents submissions financial plans and so on doesn 't seem to be a good outcome either at the same time we 've had another one of those these committees may be problematic again people will be willing to volunteer their time for meaningful roles where they can make a difference but to have a role on a committee where there seems to be some doubt as to the actual ability of that committee to influence anything in a real sense I think that probably leads into the recruitment problem that was discussed today as well I 'd actually like to see this whole thing discussed at the next waterfowl remorse as we can because it looks as though there are some constitutional issues around these zone committees that need to be dealt with that may well become more relevant as we move into an environment with a fully elected environments Canterbury then there 's been a lot more goodwill around the CWM s moving into a more political environment in the future I think we need to get this tied down now before that happens so I 'd quite like to see all of the issues that have been raised today refer to the water forum for a good discussion between governor 's and I 've just would someone like to move the motion that we have in front of us Andrew second at Phil I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's carried thank you very much thank you really appreciate your _"

    "text": "the next is the why Papa Papa no II earnest community hi everyone we this is much awaited by the community this is a small burns park really hasn 't been able to operate to its full potential for the last eight years obviously but prior to that as well because of poor drainage the ground itself has been delayed as far as completion goes because of the weather it 's been very very wet but the pavilion itself we are soft opening we are inviting some community inviting community along to the soft opening on the 15th of September oh yes this is really lovely we had we 've been meeting and talking with residents in the Dudley Street Works area and clearly there 's been a lot of stress this is a Richmond Darlington miter how primarily Shirley in Darlington area and for a very long time residents there have had to manage an awful lot of disruption and on August the 31st the official end of the Dudley Creek flood mitigation scheme works occurred an occurrence of an ending the to site compounds were wound up and were out of the area on the city first and this is something that was clearly signaled to the community and meetings and communications with them it 's still some planting that 's still to go on I 'll come back to the letters in a moment but this is the kind of challenge so we have had that 's the finished product at the bottom for water obviously there 's been some really beautiful planting in the area as well which is making a huge difference to the amenity there and roads have been reopening again which also is pretty important to the amenity and the community one of the issues remains and it is a major issue and that is the the condition of the roads generally in pavements however that is being looked at by staff and we will be addressing that in early October directly with with the community when we have our follow-up community meetings so that 's been called for and heard by the community board and by staff there was a letter going back to the letters that and this was an initiative community board was very involved in the flocked and flooding issue as a spokesperson and very well connected so she went back to some of the flopped and residents to explain and they already knew anyway because of the coverage but the the stress and and anxiety and disruption that the people in the area that the Dudley Creek works are being done and and the Sun ovens Creek works being done and but they actually don 't see the the outcome of that this is being done for further down the line so the flock turn the flock turn basin people broke these really lovely heartfelt notes that were communicated to the Shirley Richmond community this is one meter that came from Angela and Phil and they said to the residents of the Richmond area we want to pass on our sincere appreciation to the residents of Richmond for what they have had to go through over the last few years during the flood mitigation works for the flopped and basin area we can only imagine how difficult the constant noise stress road closures disruption to businesses amongst many pass on and thank you for your understanding as a previous resident at the lower end of flocked and I remember the stress and anxiety with each heavy rainfall the lifting of everything in the house the leaving home with our young baby toddler every time the water reached the bottom of the house and the anxious wait to come back the next day to see how bad the damage was I 'm so thankful that the current residents and the flocked and basin don 't have to go through that again and again and again and it is because of you and what you have endured in recent times that they can comfortably live in their homes and continue on with their lives without fear and anxiety a very heartfelt thank you so those messages really were well received and I thank Joe Boone for that initiative and and obtaining that continuing through we are still dealing with roading issues in the ward primarily these well these are primarily the main concerns we have the Cranford Street downstream mitigation plan which is in process at the moment and the from the roading engineer who has seen listened understood all of the issues through the submissions and he will be putting those into a plan and speaking to the community board about those and getting feedback from us there is another opportunity for the community to be consulted and feedback as we move forward on this really difficult issue the breeze walking festival that is citywide but of course we 've got some great areas and the purple new he underscored that we will be being involved in that I also wanted to quickly mention the main North Road bus priority project which was to be decided by the board at our last meeting and that was actually laid on the table while we asked for some more information this is with regards to the little bit between and an important but from here Wood Road to Winston eV and we asked for more information after hearing from the businesses so that is still in train I also wanted to mention the time capsule that we are opening on the 14th of September this is gonna be really cool because is a time capsule that was in the former Resource Center and San Albans the San Orban 's community center it was known as a news days as well and we 're opening that with local schoolkids and others from the community on the 14th of September and then starting a project on setting a new one up and working out what goes into that and again the schools will be key and that I also wanted to mention the 125th anniversary of women achieving the votes as you will know that 's being celebrated this year the reason I 'm mentioning this is that there is a woman in our Ward called Rachel Harris who is on the board of the National Council of women I 've just stepped down from the board of the National Council of women as we continue to deal with EQC and insurance issues and Christchurch 's just taking too much of my time so the prime minister is the keynote speaker as an event at the Isaac theater royal on the 13th of September and she 'll underlined the role of Christchurch as National Council of women headed by Kate Shepard had the first meeting in Christchurch 122 years ago that was three years after women achieved the right to vote it 's a very different group of women hitting their organization now but they 've just recently announced Helen Clarke as the patron of the organization it was fantastic to see her at the National Conference last weekend I 'd like to finish with a shameless plug for the Kate Shepherd memorial trust suffrage 125th celebration and fundraiser which is taking place on Wednesday the 19th of September at the Knox Church at 30 and it will featured Galen Preston so it will be a really awesome event it 's called history misadventures in film land an evening of entertainment mixing and mingling with refreshments if you want to know any more about that you can get in touch with me through Facebook or Google the Kate Shepherd memorial trust award and I hope that you go along and see that it will be a fantastic event thank you anyone have any questions the time capsule that you lifted harold as members that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much we 'll just take a we 're taking a 10 to 15 minute break I know that _"

    "text": "my horrible spreading in the Kashmir community board welcome here or at a toe wipe or Oh for me as an West 's hard to pronounce as everybody else 's but we 're thrilled to have our name as well this is week the Christchurch council community series so kicked off and sprayed in Kashmir so it 's and so they today with the aim of getting young people to come along to pitch an idea of something that they would like to see and sprayed in Kashmir and so two of the three pictures turned up one was about TEDx youth it was a very professional young people they wanted to do basically activity youth event that they cannot be owned by a hundred people to the other pitch was about a youth market in our area on Centennial Park and then the third one girl wasn 't able to come but it was about bike safety she was from South intermediate and wanted so it was a really great event the TDC from one it so they were getting some funding the youth in that area are doing we talked carolyn lie about community board and what we do so that we sort of this was our community service and youth service awards which we held in the old stone house and there is such a fantastic building for this kind of a k ah of people circulating and the staff provided all the food they still won 't do cream in crafts house and amongst them as karo who is a cray croft herself and her great-great-grandfather was the one who built the original building but many of these people have served the community in so many different ways that you 'd like to go through the list of people that are sitting there looking at us and talk to and talk just about them but all of all the people who received the awards were wonderful and it 's raishin can I just say to the boys I 'm with these boys I mean they when they came up they were but had the heave down they were kind of embarrassed to be getting an award and it was just so lovely because they do I of work and we hear comments from some of the older people and the other side of the ward saying that they were so pleased to see them there because they don 't hear the types of work that they do so that was for me the highlight it was it was great it was great so we 've got a community events funding as a board that came from Barrington big fund that we 're no longer holding to people that can come to the board and request funding for an event that they want to he 'll hold locally and then they also will get training so this is one that 's going to be held quite soon helped by youth the Presbyterian Church Mellon Reserve in October and know this well this is part of them huge media we are attracting we haven 't paid any any money to roof at all and in mentioning us she 's talking about the age-friendly initiative which is isn 't there 's an appalling name anybody Erin anybody who 's got some imaginative name for an age-friendly initiative please come could you fall asleep quicker so but the project itself is very exciting and it is about supporting and walking shoulder-to-shoulder and having an adventure with those people who are older and we are thinking of initiatives that we can take in our ward with people who are older that are healthier those age groups ah this is terrific the staff because I I think it 's I think it 's taken an egg but our board is always pressed on the issue of disability access and the staff came to us with a proposal for the renovation of Barrington playground which is a very popular playground next door to the library and next door to the mall with the renovation that to be disability access oriented and so and it opens on Saturday but we 've already seen the teenagers coming to the park and lying in the disability swing just for example with their headphones on that 's blissfully so we are thinking about how we can say to them quietly and gently that people with disability must have priority but the teenagers are very welcome in the things are now playground when the people with disability out there the teenagers are very welcome to camp and they might like to come at night like they do to the magnet mainly where they have a lot of fun as well so but we 're barring that we are very much looking forward to it and as usual the staff have come up with a really good idea and called it the superheroes picnic so we 've got the challenge of dressing up as well [Laughter] which was really fantastic and in there 's been consultation and we 've actually got 153 submissions now in the consultation process spray-tan neighborhood anaemic of lead this i commented yesterday they just came to a board meeting on tuesday some people have suggested some very small tiny little alterations to the plan but I think overall everyone 's very pleased with how it 's going after all of these years yeah and we are I pray craft is one of our suburbs that has been called hoon hey by the human Bible City Council for all of these years in the suburb provide a welcome pack to every new person who came into the cropped area but the new developments are ballsy 's Road etc have made that impossible to maintain but they are an extraordinarily active group of people one or two of whom were amongst those gardeners that we showed before and they 're an extraordinarily active group and they would like to have had their own name and not who hey which is too close way so and Helen amount on our board had another go at it and using the fact that the name was recognized by the national crate off was recognized by the geographic board and the National Roads board and all sorts of other organizations and the only one who still called a true name was Christchurch City Council and that is now been rectified and they 're very pleased in Chapter I said it oh and I also want to mention briefly that the HISP River Network volunteers had their anniversary celebration on Saturday end of July Saturday the 28th of July and then again was led by the lane who was one of effective body that links all the organization 's based on the river right from us down to the sea and these organizations are active through the river network and for instance are the ones that have been to the mother of all cleanups and we are very happy and pleased that that was initiated and now board and thank you Friday so the we 've gone a little bit over time so you 'll take it move by yeah turn men seconded by Phil and I 'll pop the motion I 'm sorry but thank you very much all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "gonna be a lot tidier next time right take part occur thanks for to counsel thank you this is Justin and he said to me I see into time now I 'm absolutely delighted that someone is actually watching asked what is happening on bigs Peninsula some of us had 145 millimeters and so it ranged from 30 to sort of 45 and maybe even more so it 's good to know that someone is actually watching us on big solution what 's happening to our weather this morning I 'm going to be talking about Durham our reserve development plan symmetries update buildings that firefighters and requirements flood protection by law and state highways 74 and 75 so the first one is the Romero 's ooh now that 's not coming up white move Chris we need a hand the we 've got a picture of the development plan of the reserve in our slides and Romero is a small area behind recreation reserve area behind I have talked about it before but this last month of which we only had one meeting last month so that 's where the board made the decision we have been working we have been working with with the community we had a workshop to to work with those and that and a solution the way through but we were unable to find that a clear solution so the board ultimately decided to make the decision so it 's a mixed area it 's got walking tracks cycling tracks and there 's an escalation of estimation of unmarked trails throughout this throughout this area so because it 's small and there 's cyclists that want to use it it was decided by the board that we needed to take some decisions and make to make some decisions and so quite a process around it there are a number of conflicts the board take took over the decision-making of it and we 've got that final decision so we 're just moving forward and we 'll be assisting the the the governance of that which is the reserve management committee with good management and working well as a staff moving forward the next month that next one is about the the cemeteries and we you 'll see in our notes there where we had deputations from our community who at the moment are very passionate about cemeteries not only because the bond or handbook of the symmetries behind or handbook is only review but because they are patient about their cemeteries and some of the older ones for example community so we are looking at removing some of the large pines that are an area but they feel as though they are not respecting the bodies as well the tree has more respect than what the bodies have on the cemetery so we 're looking at a way forward of resolving that and we working with that particular group now how does that go so we 're working well with with the with the staff and with the with the community so we 're looking for good outcomes we 're right at the next one buildings met firefighting requirements now this is this is an unusual issue there are under the fins the rural and the urban firefighters have been brought together and there are some rules and the for firefighting in rural and to comply with with firefighting issues and so in this bird legs flat community those small properties on very small sections need to have a 27,000 litre water tank on their properties each property at this stage so what we 're looking is aboard is as looking for is looking for some assistance at looking could be a way of doing it for building sled and maybe that there are takes somewhere that they could all plug into and think so it is an issue for um this particular community and there will be issues for other communities and we 're working through that I 'm not very good at doing this this morning right oK we 've moved pages now so we 're now onto the next one and I 'll talk about the flood protection by Lord now this is around Little River of where I 've said that in coop town they had a hundred mils of rain just that was on an about a 36-hour period just recently but this flood projection by law we are off to Environment Canterbury with a submission and we 're now this goes back to 2014 where there was some quite major floods in Little River the community was concerned they we had public meetings we got a group together a flood working party and we went to Environment Canterbury with what we knew with what we wanted and we now have a flood rating district in that catchment it 's and the whole catchment of whaaaaaa it 's a Little River catchment and they all pay the same amount of funding and we were just supporting it so this is the sort of flood catchment plan that because it 's around a river and and and Rural Banks Peninsula Environment Canterbury we own the jurisdiction Environment Canterbury not the City Council as we know and so we had to work through a process to get it so it 's quite a process to get a River rating district around this area but it was achieved and we may have to look at other areas of prospects potentially down the tree not an easy process to get the community agreed to pay for their own rating district so we 're submissions all on the same days we 've got our freedom camping ones on the 17th of 17th of August so the last one that I 'm highlighting here and I have had an opportunity this morning thank you team to be able to join one of the the state highways or joined with a meeting that that I 'll be able to observe bring to the table some of our bigs financial issues around state highway 74 and state highway 75 so we have got a number of issues around the state highway and there 's also some in Littleton and there 's some and era and we want to know what we have some problems with the crossing in Littleton that doesn 't seem to be working appropriately as it suggested it should be is that when somebody walks up to the crossing that will change lights and things that doesn 't seem to be working as it should be so and we have a whole list of things so we will be going to the council going to asking in fact asking that the state highways group of these issues that we have got so you 'll see there an eight point three prior to the commencement an assessment of how the the pedestrian crossing on Norwich King is operating now it 's not like very ranking rising and you can probably explain why it 's not operating appropriately but it 's all about that the lights don 't seem to be working don 't seem to be synchronizing for crossing that particular road so these just a few little snippets of what 's come out of our minutes thank you very much and zero would like to see conduct so is there any other any questions for Pam yep thank you for the report it 's really interesting look at your strengthening communities funding yes one name that I didn 't see on there that I expected to see only was the okay and babies in so I just wondered if they applied or whether why they 're not funded through the community before I answer that yeah but there is some special work that is being done with the kids by communities around the reserve the the time line between Nigel 's museum and Penelope Goldstone the governance manager around what the most appropriate source of funding from council would be I imagine Nigel would have taken that advice and responded accordingly but I don 't have the detail and to hand I 'm sorry no so it obviously didn 't ever come across our table at that time I will put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much _"

    "text": "thank you when my meadow I 'm a huge community board this is terrible I 'm sorry my apologies yeah anyway can somebody find out for me yeah okay well good morning run thank you again for the chance to come in and present our update for the month a look it 's relatively light this month and that there are no parties I just want to run through a few things in the report then we 'll touch on a couple of slides and the PowerPoint and first of all we 've obviously used our community board and decision making under delegation ability we 've put in a few no-stopping restrictions and probably the big thing and I 'll touch on it so shortly is around the suction tank and the Jeffries reserve which did go in as well so that was quite a big local issue and we 've used the Youth Development Fund applications as well so we 've paid out some money under there and then just at least to touch on a couple of the local community issues or events obviously got the bishop down and Burnside which was quite positive we 've put some money towards some lights and the Burnside tennis club on Haven Head Road so again that 's a well used facility in our patch so it was great to use that as well and then obviously we 've got the brand were youth workers work who just continue to do great work so what we 've only got a couple of slides so the first one is around the Jeffries Reserve pump station so you 've probably heard me for the last couple of months keep saying how that was coming to the board and it went out for consultation initially there were a couple of challenges with it and then it came back to us after going back out again and look I 'm comfortable we got the right solution on that we listened to deputation so array you know we took him to consideration the feedback from the community and as a result with our staff to do a bit of sort of work around mitigating the appearance of that just for effective local residents but I mean infrastructure that needed to go back effectively where the old pump station was and sometimes you kind of have to make those hard decisions and that was one of them in our pitch Erin might touch on now this one yes so the weed and the groins has been sprayed which is great news there 's going to be a mechanical harvesting of that pretty soon after the chemicals had time to act and then hopefully a little bit of needed from on the 14th of October we 'll proceed and then finally our group the month is the bringer youth workers so I London the team do a great job working in both Cobham and boots on primary they do a lot of stuff around I guess developing young leaders which is really positive in our community and particularly in those areas as well so it gives them something to do a lot of the time after school but it gives them sort of a bit of purpose as well so look a really positive thing and as always we like to bring something like that to you just happening in our community so look like I said short and sweet this month thanks very much could I just stress a point last week attended the water New Zealand public consultation here in Christchurch water New Zealanders openly advocating for a new water regulator in New Zealand it 's Havelock North inquiry submission focused on mandatory water treatment and install centralized decision-making on water and on sewer it clearly holds views different to ours and seeks to undermine the local government in my opinion why is the Christchurch City Council well it 's been a member for a very long time and this is not an appropriate use of the community board report so there is a mechanism for raising these issues at Council by way of the notice of motion and various other means and you know the Christchurch City Council has been a member of water and said for a lot longer than the current executive in regime that has that has taken a very strong advocacy role on the issues that you 've raised but appreciate you raising them but this isn 't quite the right never let the chance go by attitude arm today okay no that will do it will do so Rick would you like to move receipt of the report and Jamie seconded I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's Kerry thanks very much _"

    "text": "Nyx 's while cooler Linwood central hit community board report to Council Sally 's an apology thank you so I 'm happy of course to take the report has read with a couple of highlights firstly is the granting of a license of a part of rectly Park Commons trust sorry for person to operate in the PowerPoint it 's gonna be less creative I 've note of course is also the opening of the incredible new wolf stirred library and there was a hot real highlight of the board 's program and also the excitement over the Linwood Wolfson Paul continues to grow and staff have done a great job of outreach by coordinating a group of eight local school children to visit swimming facilities locally and in Selwyn and Timaru and during the order so they can be better informed and so we can draw on their more informed and firm preferences I want to also note the board approved a payment of over thirty thousand dollars to facilitate the rebuilding of of steps along beach ville road ricklefs and these were damaged during the earthquake and has returned ever since and we 're pleased to be able to make it happen however it was noted that the DRF isn 't the appropriate funding channel for capital projects of this nature however we wanted to capitalize on the sharp price of the biota the contractor completing nearby works and of course we had no desire to see the ratepayer picked up the extra cost of completing the work separately or is even or or even as part of another project that would result in the large amount of staff time to coordinate so the other thing is although not part of this report I 'd like to mention a resolution of the board 's Monday meeting to write members of parliament Williams and Rick Dyson asking them to progress an update to the council 's district plan under Section City one of the region in residential overlay Clause five point two point two a and would encourage Council to take swift action in the same vein so that 's and also finally I 'd like to take a second to acknowledge the immense hard work of ship I meeting and and boy has been a wealth of knowledge to me and I 'm sure the risks and the board and I wish her well for her future in Wellington what delivers what she describes yesterday is I kept woman I 've been taken by surprise I didn 't realize this was your last meeting we 're losing you to Wellington congratulations in you know that and thank you for everything that you 've done I know that you 've been a tremendous source of guidance and support for the community ball but actually the relationship with the rest of the council as well in the community I 've get constant feedback about you and you know the you know connections you 've made are going to be long held so you 'll always be welcome home don 't make Wellington your home and since you 've stopped on this picture you know just thought how extraordinary that the governor-general came and opened the Linwood North School Hall I just thought it was a fantastic story and she told a story during the opening ceremony and where she talked rural teachers and she she 'd said that when she was born she actually was at the back of the classroom and a little person eat and that the children of the school helped to raise her and she had this wonderful connection with with the children I don 't think they 'll ever forget their opening and what she said it was it was stunning so yeah really special David I 'm thinking look I just like to speak a wee bit about your beach ball road project and commend the board for the work that they have done to actually give this project and way my only reservation is you 've had to resort to your own drf fund to to get these works done and it 's obviously a sizeable chunk of money out of your DRA which I feel is rather disappointing for their community had to expend this amount of money to get this valuable project underway so I would like to suggest that to the chief executive there some mechanisms look there to restore the community board 's discretion response fund because I believe been benefit for the whole of the city and it seems unusual that you 've had to take the step of using the area managed to do there I 'm I 'm not sure whether this uh I mean as far as I 'm aware if it 's a discretionary response but I could add some parity sorry the board did actually put it forward as that but in the able TP when you 're playing here before and it doesn 't go through which is the reason it came to GRE so it 's been through a council process already to seek funding wasn 't successful and we 're always asked to prioritize things and you know priorities sometimes such that won 't make a priority around the table across the city when we 're all thinking with our city hats on rather than our individual community boards but a community board does have a discretionary response fund for the purpose of adding priority to something that wouldn 't make the catch otherwise so David did you want to I totally appreciate all that I 'm just disappointed that and they 've had to pay for it ever dr if and community boards have huge calls on their di refund and so I 'll probably just expressing my disappointment that that sort of process had to occur in this instance but I do yeah we agreed it 's a board and it was originally going to be funded out of uh skirts mascoutah there appears down that area but because it wasn 't safe to put it back exactly where it was and it needed to be moved slightly it became out of scope and so was never done so can I just make a quick comment there clearly at the time of the annual plan we 'll have a chance to rectify and look at those sort of issues and write accordingly all right see would you like to move that the report be received and seconded by Danny sorry the project manager for the Woolston Community Library I 'm Celina Robertson just wanted to say that there was huge praise on her for what was a really great project basically I really worked with the local community going since 1871 it 's one of the oldest libraries in Christchurch and although it 's now a community library volunteer library it 's got a huge history of that goes along with it and I just really wanted to acknowledge the great work that she did bringing that project together along with city care who actually built it city care felt to of our volunteer libraries red cliffs and Woolston they 've done an amazing job so I think we should be really proud of the work that they 've done and also and I think possibly for another time but there are a number of local people who helped particularly with some of the furnishings so there was David Wooden 's who donated one of his prints out of order number three which has a shot of the old building there was Murray green who actually had a photo taken in 1952 of people marching down Ferry Road on Anzac Day and he 's allowed us to use it it 's framed with salvaged timber from the old building and there was also other things that we were great facility that 's that 's that 's open there was a huge community responds to being being opened and although people are said to see the old heritage building not be there anymore it was really touching to have part of the brick from the old building that was presented which is what you saw in the photo so just want to acknowledge the great work that happened on there thank you thank you alright I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much thank you _"

their board area it was great to go to the 20th anniversary of the 7 youth workers just recently some of us that have been around forever can remember supporting that group and to get up and up and running and operating very successfully in our community so we 're very very proud of that association that we 've got with our 7 youth workers who are operating from their schools and in the community and resource concede has now been lodged evidently he will receive forever and you reckon community center so we 're really looking forward to progressing the progress of that that 's something had 7 been quite a long time coming but and their Ward the we headed Dean 's at precinct society come and raised concerns about the old Eddington sale yards sort and beans eV and general issues around that area so we 're very pleased to know that actually working on that to try and get that area cleaned up as you can see we 've got there 's a mix of Ti in for there for that land you 've got people have been dumping rubbish they 're sleeping rough and it 's just generally a bit of an eyesore so we 've really really like to support the community and and encourage their staff to keep working proactively as much as they can to get that area there a resource consent application and on that side a sword it 's the same owner us or not yeah yeah so essentially they will want they want to conceits and things flagged for that area in the past but they haven 't sort of eventuated so know that I mean we can 't predetermine a result of a bit results consent so moving on the interior helpful random effect organizations that would be very very pleased to be able to support with their youth development funding strengthening communities grants and especially discretion your response funds projects so we 've got a an event coming up shortly where some of the youth development funding people are actually coming to report back to our board on how that funding has helped them with their goals and objectives and what their funding was for so we 've really really welcome the opportunity to get that feedback from from our young people and the sale yards we 've already spoken about and there 's a lesson to be learned here I had a thing can 't_''_252.93 happen with skateparks and they are we are very pleased to say that they 're no extreme state park has been built and we 're in the opening the grand opening of that is on the 12th of October which is the last Friday of the school holiday so we 're really looking forward to that I can 't_''_274.289 say that I won 't be skateboarding that day but I 'll be there looking and and enjoying take part in that activity sorry absolutely I think of this I think Yanni might be able to come and give a few demonstrations do you handsome so that 's something that we 're looking forward to and we 're very very pleased to say that Wis fields local hero one of our youth workers mama has got attended or the de la Vida youth trust is got a ten thousand dollar grant from Westfield for our local hero so that 's it was only three recipients of that those grants and he 's the only one working locally in record and so that 's really really good and the horse will means shed that 's a really great asset to the community I can 't wait to get old enough and have enough time to actually go and and join the the men in the men 's sheds but it 's a it 's a great asset to the community and to the to the well-being of the community a course and there 's a lot of skill in the community with them with retired people that have got actually create all sorts of good stuff so I think we really recognize them as a star group in their area and my wheel that other people will be talking about I 'm Kate Shepherd later on but anyway cake and lived in our Ward and in 83 Clyde Road the property 's still there so just recognize that it was people just need to take take that step that big step which Kate did to actually change the world really change the world as far as woman 's rights are concerned so we 're very proud to have that association with them with dak Shepherd so if there 's any questions a question a question not so much of Mike but of maybe of Colleen and but relevant to the society along about that area but right in the middle of that area is our own Road preserved for we 're blenheim road was Vicky Steele who came along with a butterfly garden proposal she 's now developed that proposal and one of the places that we would love to put it is on that road reserve just as there doing nothing I don 't know the long-term plans for it but the residents Association were favorable towards that the community board was fine with it and she 's now developed a concept who 'd how do we actually produce it let me get back to you Jimmy Choo yes you can move it and you can ask a question really good question it was repeated I did notice that I was a bit reluctant to raise it okay thank you to move and

taking it to the streets and I had the opportunity to meet with Rob and I did suggest that it would be an excellent opportunity for him to come and talk to counsel about what he has been undertaking and yeah what that means for the city from here looked for ways to be relevant to the inner city we they had been since 1864 the longest serving church within the city really needs a bit more kudos I 'm just putting that out there streets the project that I am the only person off was the response to how to be try to be relevant with no building no office no programs in 2016 I started walking the streets in July with a job description that was deliberately so loose you could drive a bus through it I talked with lots of people all the people I meet on streets I listen to whatever discovered a hidden side of Christchurch 's in a core mist if you walk too fast through the city I think I 've read and photographed almost every plaque I 've set on many of the seats watching people of drunk coffee and almost all of the cafes at least once but like you I 've got my favorites as well the job evolved into reflection as a wandering theologian story collector a reflector and an advocate I 've said on pavements with street ease I visited the rarefied atmosphere of the 6th floor of this building I 've shown tourists with the nearest toilets are and why is there no app for that I 've listened to tearful frightened people and I 've laughed uproariously with others I 've been hugged by street ease and strangers and always I 've walked slowly slowly through the city looking and reflecting I photographed many things and not just new or old buildings or supermarket trolleys and very weird places although they 're there as well I 've studied the theory of cities and I 've read the cries for help on art and music of this place that I 'm hoping for global warming because the winters on the streets are better in the new lane ways simply funneled cold air I 'm an ore of what 's been done and by what 's not yet happened in the inner city every day I 'm reminded that the city is a place where the stranger lives and that every single one of us is a stranger to almost everybody else on the streets we hear lots about mental health issues and the difficulty in getting treatment some of those are quake related but others are the normal process of human beings becoming urbanized for the first time in human history over 50 percent of the world 's population is now urban the figure will grow faster and faster that means that we 're always living with strangers and yet humans are social animals so in the city we can quickly become loners isolates anonymous and struggle to understand why we can 't make friends it will get more acute in the future planning alone does not solve this but good planning the university I hear versions of that every day much of it I think is the time that 's passed since the quakes eight years now and people in eight years have formed habits that keep them in familiar other places the same cafes the same roots other things beyond shopping it 's hard to break that habit so I 've shown people around the inner city the rabbits the eels by the bridge of remembrance it e routes plaque told the strange but true story of how come we have a statue of Captain Cook that has no mayor 's name on it shown them the weeping willow that came from Napoleon 's tomb wandered but down by the bricks and discovered the far reaches of the navigable Aven River which is really to be frank just a creek not really a river at all I grew up by the clue that I found people often who 've lived here all their lives saying I had no idea this was here it 's the quirky the fun and the new knowledge that will finally bring people into the city of things unknown about this place that deserved to be uncovered and explored so as I came to the end of my time with the streets project which I finish in three weeks I pondered how to report to the Methodist parish that employs me after two and a bit years of wandering through the streets of this inner city I chose to make a photo book pictures with few words capture the inner city as I 've found a way better than reports on a4 paper or even powerpoints it 's been my privilege to have been a loose cannon on the streets of the city it 's a pleasure to offer to you the City Council a copy of my report so that you can put it in your archives or check it around wherever you choose many of you I know well now and I 'm glad to be honest that it 's you not me sitting in those seats and I wish you well in the years of thank you very much I will pass it round because it 's outstanding and thank you very much you know just really appreciate what you 've done and it 's and it 's actually a gift that you 're leaving with us and it 's very much appreciated so thank you for coming on next item is a deputation by appointment Camryn Swanson oh I misunderstood this is this appropriate okay well if it gives up people an opportunity via cameron 's wants online technology speaking to item 14 East gouta trading permit application welcome thank you good morning first and foremost I 'd like to thank the council for allowing us the opportunity I 'm here today to talk to you about my background what brought us to New Zealand Christchurch in particular our operational plan safety precautions are proposed pilot period as well as the program size so why was founded in January 2017 with a mission to transform the world mobility options in the smart equable and same way were the first and largest smart mobility provider with multimodal fleet of doctrine pedal bikes electric assist bodies and electric scooters we currently operate in over 80 markets in five countries New Zealand it 's long forward-thinking sustainability practices its embrace of innovation and its citizens you know healthy well-being practices are key factors for our desire to launch here Christchurch with its flat poverty and its history of its rich history of cycling it 's just a natural fit for wine we 're excited to see the city at the forefront of this rapidly growing sector secure in Christchurch if approved by council we 'll run a 7 operation ensuring a positive customer experience in an orderly public right-of-way our team will consist of a local operations manager and dozens of full-time operation specialists who work on rebalancing and repairs both in the field and in our warehouse in addition to that our juicer program allows anyone in the public to join our network of chargers that collects in charge of scooters at their own home the paper scooter will be commensurate with the difficulty of finding that scooter as well as the current charge level safety is our number one priority and we will continue to push an agenda here in Christchurch well we can see that it 's impractical to provide a helmet encourage safe riding practices this includes occasional helmet giveaways on street user demonstrations and trol in a safe riding guidelines and a scooter with front and rear lights side reflectors and a dual braking system as with all of our markets we will indemnify the city with a 1 million dollar public liability policy our proposed three-month pilot period will allow 700 scooters to be deployed wet by lime at any time the pilot period provides safeguards for the same as well as allows lime to determine how best to serve the community through trial following the pilot we will propose to increase our fleet to a dynamic cap of 1500 scooters the dynamic cap will allow us to work closely with the city to determine how many scooters employ on a rolling basis better metrics will offer more scooters whereas worse metrics will lower the cap so I implore you all to review the operational we 've lived plenty of time for questions so it 's great thank you Mike oh it 's great they 've done this deputation because I have a couple of questions are you looking potentially in the future because I just noticed in job advertising for the operations men that you mentioned ebikes yeah yes we have three different product lines we 've seen that scooters are the most popular we see just six or seven trips for scooter per day versus the bikes which you know he likes get around three standard to rule out the banks for the future potentially down the track you 'll be part yeah okay and you talked about helmets so that you understand in it that it 's good ejector where it 's my understanding that it 's not required question so you 're looking and just doing similar schemes in Auckland and Wellington Wellington what number you thank you I really like the idea I 'm just wondering what advice you will be given to users about where the scooters that illegal to be ridden so it 's my understanding that in New Zealand there 's a bit of gray area at the time when the scooters can you ridden both on sidewalks and in on the street we will encourage you know it can change required to have hurt our users right in the street so we tell them that there 's a few screens that they need to swipe through that says he 's always wear a helmet he 's always right in the street as well we could do something similar here in Christchurch although we can 't necessarily require anything like that we can encourage them to are you aware that the ins ETA website under the low powered vehicle section specifically states that a scooters aren 't able to be written on the road is that they can option I think particular website the NZTA one official went under low powered vehicles and it says specifically that they cannot be running on the road yeah specific on the on the website okay um the the public liability insurance a million dollars under what circumstances could that be used do you think so I 'm aware that the the contrary to users will probably say to users you know you 're responsible for whether you 're right of Legally all those kind of things what type of thing could that be used have our outdated version attached yeah have an uber woman I can send you yeah as far as insurance if there any sort of lawsuit for injuries it 's laughing from me and the geofencing and does it mean the bikes can 't_''_953.259 be ridden past the GOP correct so there 's an area and just to me that that 's must out currently that 's down here the coastal pathway and all the way out down the baby Rita Sumner and going to Sumner would be the same distance as going all the way down to the South Shore which is in the area I 'm wondering if you were able to extend that out yeah yeah we 're happy to actually thank you just picking up on the NZTA as you I 've got an full and then Yanni just picking up on the NZTA issue but you 'll ensure that whatever in crisis is given on the app matches up with the legal advice that you get from NZTA yep and one of their strategic priorities is to increase active transport so this is great it would these I think that would be really appealing and you I think the biggest issue probably is safety I think it 's what 's coming through from the discussions we 've hit already yeah I don 't have any some scooters so far just minor injuries don 't go incredibly fast our latest version of the scooter like I mentioned before they naturally point didn 't really what you 'd expect from riding Thank You Cameron I understand my questions were you on the safety toe and because I understand that for example because there with the but the scooters have we docked that the way for example that a rider would understand safe for safety long as if you like would be by way of it yeah the scooters actually won 't be docked the bike rack walk up to the scooter scooter so and like I would see just from the air report that this is like it like a pilot for three months but there 's also a condition that if things if there 's any breach that wasn 't remedy within ten days that in fact it works would if some safety issues that have been right you know been raised and we were concerned about you giving us an undertaking they will be worked towards that you would work towards resolving pictures though it 's thinking thank you very much we 've come to the end of the ten minutes so don 't thank you for your time and yeah thanks for the for bringing the idea to our presentation of petitions it 's a process question obviously someone 's will have questions for staff that the staff may not be able to answer without so a number of us had a question you know additional questions so are we able to get those asked as part of the staff report well I 'm in the hands of the council if people would like to extend the time I 'm happy to accept that you might have been planning to be zipping out of here in ten minutes oh yeah scooting away okay well I 'm just wondered in terms of charging and usage do you charge a bond when people sign up if so and then also just in terms of the issue of the cost is it I see you 're working with over in other parts of the world is that going to be also done in Christchurch it 's still underway anyone else oh my just one more question um another cities we juices turf wars with people trying to take a patch and don 't let anyone live until them a little bit it 's more so much I wouldn 't necessarily say but thank you I don 't have a question which was some somebody emailed me about an older person who had experience overseas of being on the footpath and of course Erin Lee a scooters are very quiet so you know it 's sort of feeling but you know sort of unprotected on a footpath um is there a zero-sum way of letting people know that you 're you 're coming you know right and you would recommend thatif you see an elderly person in front of you right okay that 's good to know excellent well thank you very much much appreciated _"

    "text": "and we 'll start with item 1 apologies now I have an apology from the mayor and I have an apology from councillor Johansson who may join us later but just depending on timing so an apology either for absence or late arrival from councillor Johansson I 've got an apology for an early departure from councillor east yep all right so an apology for partial absence or early departure from councillor Templeton no other apologies all right that 's great so I 'm happy to move those apologies do I have a seconder my Davidson thank you very much all those in favor say aye against that 's carried declarations of interest we have a number of declarations of interest which are noted on the paper if any declarations come up during the course of the meeting which have not been taken into account in item 2 please make them known at that time so now we come to item 3 the Metropolitan strengthening communities fund so just to make some introductory comments staff have worked on a number of applications which have been through a council workshop the recommendations amended with guidance and input from that councillors workshop so that 's the basis of the meeting today our role today is to consider any amendments and a number of been signaled and then come to a final recommendation which will be voted on and at the end of this meeting approved and that 's what will be implemented by staff so welcome to the table it might be good for us to take some comment from staff on this if there is any comment and then we 'll move to any general questions and then we 'll move into considering any amendments to the recommendation that 's in front of us so Nicola if you 've got any general comments that you wanted to make at this time thank you today the huge task of assessing these applications has been undertaken by the advisors you see living in the States behind me the purpose of the Strickland communities fund support community focused organizations whose projects contribute to the strengthening of community well-being and Christchurch successful organizations are those who demonstrate that their sustainable strategic and community focus groups applications to the fund must demonstrate sound governance appropriate financial management and you put reporting practices they must have the operational capability and capacity to deliver the outcomes that is agreed of the 2018-19 metropolitan communities in priorities the strengthening communities fund criteria and a decision matrix document which outlines the requests being sought from the fund the matrix details the IPSec grants requests the core organization details staff assessment and grant the communication all applications presented to the year today have gone through a process of assessment firstly by individual advisors followed by a collective review at a staff collaboration meeting all of the applications have been assessed as either a priority one two three or four priority one applications are those that we consider contribute significantly to funding outcomes and priorities and applications that we have recommended to fund well priority 2 applications contribute to funding actions and priorities but not as closely as those that are priority one these are applications we are recommending making a contribution towards priority 3 applications are not recommended for funding to use some funding speak these are applications there if we to make a contribution towards but unfortunately we can 't priority for applications are also not recommended for funding there are assessed to have a minimum contribution to funding outcomes and priorities or they may have insufficient information provided to make an assessment that is after their application is considered and through the requests for information have been made or it may be that other sources of funding are considered more appropriate in total we have 190 Metropolitan applications with requests totaling over 8 million dollars there were no ineligible applications received to the fund this year start recommending 12 applications for funding for 2 year funding impeccable spreadsheets the total budget available for all 190 applications to be considered today is three million one hundred and sixty four thousand seven hundred and eighty nine dollars Stafford made recommendations totaling three million one hundred and fifty three thousand three hundred and seventy four dollars as you 'll see on this spreadsheet a change has been made to the balance available there is the budget the spreadsheet in front of you will also help you keep track of your decisions as at this point I 'm happy to take any general questions so not questions on specific applications which Nicola will be able to answer so Sarah first of all if we hit all the money in the world but actually they meet all our funding criteria currently and it wouldn 't need it 's really all the funding in the world but just some if we had more council funding available we would choose to fund some of those because they do contribute to all of the outcomes that we 're looking for Jimmy wanting precious I send an email to you in the young Jaffa so we got into the within the multicultural sectors I compared this coming year in the previous year which project or projects has been reduced or I got a reprieve from you you know maybe take a week I just don 't know what solution there can neither gather this information so Jimmy I 'm going to ask John Phil cell to respond to that question okay yeah look Thank You Jimmy we we got the requests and an each request we provided as it clear that the reason we couldn 't provide the rest would be the time and resource taken to do that and we also gave a few points on the relevance of the information that you were that you were asking for so the reason we couldn 't do it is one the very short notice the one request came in essentially this morning and the rest was a a couple of death the other one was a couple of days ago we 've done what we can but we we can 't do any more in the time frame and we sought to give you some information back on the value and the relevance of all of the information you are asking for so we we haven 't got that information we can 't provide it thank you so I 've got Phil Glen and then back to Sarah Phil thanks Nicola can you discuss an indication like we the group is withdrawn like it has done for the surround what are you able to tell us what sort of priority of funding they had been eligible for I time this level for metropolitan funds is usually around if we 've granted multi-year funding if there 's any other funding that we 've had to take thank you it 's useful to know probably an annual plan consideration so yeah thank you for that thank you Sarah back to you thank you last year when we came to this we also had applications for some of these organizations being considered by the committee resilience of partnership funding and we 're currently not doing that for some of these applications we 're also not looking at the capital endowment fund which we had allowed the inflation adjustment to be used for community and there 's hundreds of thousands of dollars sitting in there so why we 're not looking at those other organizations currently we 're going to come to us and if we had organizations do we have organizations in here that would meet the funding for say the kid one down and so I know that an account in the long term plan there was a resolution but each year an escape that would potentially meet those and question I 'm going to allow the question so Keppel endowment fund it was specifically set aside some for community to officers and we hit that funding available and there are organizations and here which we could potentially have funded through that instead of strengthening communities would you mind if I yeah yeah firstly the chairs reminded me we did cover this at the workshop yep secondly the the the capital endowment fund operates there 's an application that 's put to it considered by the Council on its own merits so if there was after this strengthening communities allocation process an organization that felt that it wished to make an application to the capital endowment fund they are very welcome to do that through through our funding team so a broad-brush call at this point in time before the funds been allocated on whether that 's an option yet probably you can 't make but certainly arising from this an organization could feel that it 's a it should take this course of action one thing that we are very conscious of is the council have approved a set would like to follow that out and get your assistance in doing that we have staff have already gone through a process where they 've said well actually it 's that might suit their community resilience partnership fund in so actually we 're not bringing them to council we 've talked to those organizations did we consider doing a process that was similar with any organizations here for the capital endowment fund where those organizations were no we didn 't and the reason that we didn 't do that at the time was the start that the funder opened in last financial year and all of these recommendations and decision-making matrices were done before council had made changes to the capital and almond farm so we we didn 't go through that process and you know the staff recommendations were what they were coming to the workshop taking into account those things that staff I mean Jon you 've made some comment on this felt were appropriate to take into account down mean the environment that they were working in at that time the workshop yes you know the issue time and we 've had some further information on that now I 've got a number of amendments that people have signaled that we 're going to consider at the meeting this afternoon and none of those at this stage is referring any application to the capital endowment fund so that would be the way to deal with this if that 's what you were wanting to do there 's one last thing organizations that do get funding today are they eligible and would they meet criteria to apply for additional funding through the capital of Darwin fund yes thank you so now I 've got Tim and Phil and I 'm reasonably keen to move on to deal with some of these amendments just a clarification before Chris was asked about the amount and you were saying in 2010 that it was reduced from 10 to around 10 million to 7.2 so following the earthquake so it hasn 't changed from that 7.2 could we also get an idea of the increase in groups that have been asking for funding because there 's a two-way thing here one is reduced prior to the earthquake and the the amount of need because we 've got groups like you know get follow and others that have been created that hit from that who are also going into the thank you and then finally Phil no a teacher I 'm John as answered my okay that 's great all right so if we can now move on from general questions I 've got a number of amendments that have been signaled and what I 'm going to do is take the amendments in the order in which they were signaled so there was there has been the opportunity since the workshop for councilors through a process to signal those by email and the number have been raised verbally since that time as well so I 'm going to take the amendments in the order in which they 've been signaled which means that the first amendment that we 'll deal with is an amendment from David East what I 'm going to do is to get each person moving an amendment to get a second at that point just a very brief as to the purpose of the amendment and what 's intended then they 'll be the opportunity to ask questions to staff if required and then we 'll debate if required and take a vote on each amendment I 'm keen to keep this as short and concise of process as it can be given that this has already been through a workshop so any amendments really just changes further to as a result of further considerations or in date space because he wasn 't_''_2935.19 out of the workshop so Dave so I just all right so apparently what we need to do is to get the staff report moved and seconded before we go into the amendments so Tim is happy to move this dion is happy to second it so if we can then take a vote on this No so just moved and seconded all right so moved and seconded desserts the staff report so now we 're taking so now we 're taking amendments so Dave I 'll come to you for the first amendment and if you can detail the application numbers speak to it described I thank you mr. chairman I think we 're looking [Music] one seven eight and apologies I wasn 't able to be here for the earlier workshop I 'm putting forward this application because I feel that it in the city it 's one that resonates quite well with the aspirations of this fund and it caters specifically for access to the beach for disabled people and of disability in providing access the beach for the wheelchair walking Stokes practice all sorts of things and there was a trial last year with a fairly narrow map that was quite coarse it was extremely successful and I think I 'm very keen to see this fund of this application be funded to a degree and I 'm proposing that the 5001 be applied to this this application and I believe here of Templeton 's heavy to Sikandar okay so this amendments moved by David II seconded by sarah temple term and the we 've captured the amendment few technical issues here okay so the amendment is to add five thousand and one dollars to 178 taking that from the balance the opening comments so moved and seconded is there any debate on this all right so I 'll take a vote all those in favor say aye all right against so that one 's carried thank you okay so next I 'll come to an amendment has been signaled by Pauline Cotter and seconded by Phil Clearwater Pauline increased in thousand the original application and what they have been receiving for a few years on the council has been 30,000 and that 's mainly for the administrators salary now to receive team as a considerably decrease and I think the projects will be honest I think that 's great fits in with a lot of the council 's activities in our strategic directions they were working directly with the community and keeping our city clean in our waterways and and also with 35 to 40 schools they 've got great programs I think that if we can keep them up to 20,000 again that 's a reduction of 30% of what they 've historically been receiving so I yep so Clearwater indicated he was second miss thank you are there money in you need to find where to take it from so Pauline suggestion as to where the money comes from so I 'm suggesting we shave from that group so you 're suggesting Pauline that the funding the 10,000 that you 're wanting to add to keep Christchurch beautiful would be taken proportionately from a number of the major organizations is that all of the major organizations or just some so what percentage is there it 's a pretty strange process that 's gone just through the luck of the draw I think that we would have sit here and go through all the other recommendations and start packing into pieces we would be here for a very very very long time we may not even resolution so this to me is the easiest way that if these are men months providing their don 't end up to an enormous figure and we they may not that would be a tiny but all those ones nothing that 's the easiest way to go about three percent of those I 'm looking at keep quite reputed was potentially falling over for the slow Jordan of the lady that administrator in once that 's gone they don 't be the end of their a quite a strong group they 're getting stronger and they have really good branding and identity under a national umbrella and I thought I 'd be doing very well to support this group in partner with them to help achieve our own goals so I 'm looking for them reducing in by only 30 percent not seventy five percent alright so the amendment is clear are they further questions for staff on this Glenn so could we just please be clear on the organizations for which aren 't excluded in other words those from which the money is coming yep yep so so it 's all of the major organizations with the exception of show biz show Symphony Orchestra ferry Mead and around a park so that 's the amendment okay can I speak to yep once we 're done with questions then we 'll move to debate no further questions Jamie staff going to write that up because you know I don 't think anyone 's for that it 's just I guess more a procedural thing they 'll be really good to see exactly what their percentages in adult terms what that means alright so John 's in a position to give an indica dummy given that this is a dynamic environment it 's difficult to come up with exact numbers but John is able to give an indicative amount which hopefully Jamie will go some way to asking the question that you 've answered in question that you 've asked John it 's about 3% 3% yep so if all of the amendments that are going to be put this after yeah if all of the amendments that are going to others have signaled are going to be put this afternoon were to be carried the effect on the major organizations indicative Lee would be around 3% oh sorry Andrew that 's just for that that one individually just this one yeah okay 3% from the staff recommendation correct so would be good before we start doing these individually to realize that impact because every single member now is going to be wanting to give me the sentiment are you hearing around the ring pooling is there something else that you 're comfortable with putting this amendment the way that you 're crafting it when we know I took the amendments in the order they were signaled the amendment that we took first was the only amendments that had come by email prior to the informal discussion that occurred prior to this meeting where the person who had sent the email was also present at that meeting so I strictly on taking the amendments in the order that they 've been signaled starting with emails that were received according to the process that was outlined previously depends on what so I don 't know I 'm not really getting a feeling that there 's a lot of support for this around the table so I 'm wondering with the perhaps we should try I don 't know what the process from here is to Ameen the amount yeah I mean you you may want to just put the amendment the video you 've got an amendment which you 've you 've moved in it fine so the amendment is seventeen and a half thousand from the major organizations that have been signaled pulling you spoken to it there any further questions Dave three at three percent on all major organizations you 've got another number of other signaled amendments but that was just for them this particular and that was three percent of all of the organization 's they the amendment proposed by councillor Cotter excluded a number of those organizations thus the residual percentage is higher for the ones that are left okay all right so we 've we 've got an amended you move and seconded is there any debate on this I also want to support this I think it 's well known that keep clay ships beautiful have been the umbrella organization for a whole lot of clean up parts of air city for a long time and I think we owe it to them not not to cut the the leading coordinators Syrian in effect that kind of thing to cut to the chase but I just think that know so much has developed well kcb being the umbrella and I think it 's not a good time to actually make a reduction so that 's why I 'm very supportive of the reduced amendment that they 're pulling has put forward thank you Sarah thank you you know the same thing almost every organization and that list we have we cut them all last year we 've cut them all again this year and I can 't support doing that for one organization over another organization that is just as valuable intensity sorry good thank you we know I disagree with this we don 't look at the organization 's proposed which the cut would come I can speak about one of them and not the other but they won 't relate to the community sector and we 've just had the the full well beans you know they 're going to be restored this runs against that and I don 't see why you would cut funding for instance from Christchurch Community House and so it 's on those grounds it thank you Tim and then I 'll come back to you Pauline at the end of serie saying every one of these organizations and their staff said and especially their threes we if we had the money we would be giving them to them and they staff would be recommending that but you know the other side of this is if we only talked about shaving and shaving off the ones and pink they are large organizations generally who do really really good work and if you look at the amount that their projects are costing that they 're undertaking the amount that they are requesting but the amount that is recommended and seems at this moment to be given are hugely different to what the what they 've requested so we keep shaving off these guys it does fit them so that hurts these guys as much as everybody or anybody else where they 're a size or as taken into account everything is important so I 'll be voting against this mean that thank you okay pulling back to you and then we 'll take a vote I just come back to the effect that to reduce an organization by 75% with the stroke be determined to look around for money but it does put a lot of strain in there and you know everybody is I just think it 's very harsh from this council I mean we 'd be given to support these people and actually with them and how many times do we sit around here and yes yes the big organization is are really really important I 'd like to give way more as well but I think grassroots organizations this one 's running on 30,000 a year in a ton of volunteer hours in this administrator does a ton more work than she actually is paid for so it 's that kind of gold you 've got there and I think these are equally with supporting as well so they 'll be even if I mean that does pass and I do hope it does they 're being reduced by probably around 35% to 40% now so I think we need to be there in mind that we need to really look after these grassroots people so I do hope that you support this all right so I 'll right against can I have a show of hands for the eyes 1 2 3 4 5 so that 's lost ok moving on to the next one Canterbury resettlement Resource Center so Jimmy this is yours I 've got a note that it 's moved by you Jimmy seconded by Anne could you speak to it briefly and then we 'll take questions thank you the increase from the original 15k to the 20k increase a moment so I suggest the male working together with the minister in motivation last last Saturday petechia emphasized I 'll choose as a city resettlement center again since the 2011 earthquake and also Council we have launched the multicultural strategy for most one year I will feel the funk in the twenty all those one before the we launched this one and after we launched this one particular focus on the multicultural sector no any increase those families fears theater the saint of Fundy and we compared lost ratio a moment 25% percent is in relation to the multi multi culture group fundings only around the ten percent only the other ones we patches our city of graffiti as I said on the centre the work law for Easter ago where we increase significantly so that you we dropped a 25% because of 20k our 5k know then how they can make a happen last year pew is you always a 20k so this my recommendation alright thank you so this is moved by Jimmy and seconded by and and the source of the additional funding so what we 're looking at in front of us here in the workshop it was a percentage of major organizations yes and that 's a point Nations you wanting to take the funding from proportionately across the consulate but he comes in the showpiece for me maybe one maybe point the fight to think Amina needs I just want to know so your proposal Jimmy is potentially to exclude the four projects that you 've just named yeah okay we need a firm amendment as to where the funds are coming from well maybe you can move an amendment which has got a clear recommendation is found that 's what we need I mean if you may be what you 're about to get but we needed a firm amendment so that people can choose whether to vote on it or not all right John 's just working on the answer yeah John 's just working on is it yep okay so Tim will take your questions and then John will provide the advice that Jimmy 's asked for thank you with regards to resettlement of refugees etc what part does the government pay financially with regards to that and that would be mr. chairman that would be the same thing for the Christchurch resettlement services which is going to presume again becoming the extra Chet and Jimmy put up alright thank thank you John 's got Nansen answer the question Jimmy that you asked and then we need to really pin down what your amendment is okay so it 's on the wanting to take the funds off if you exclude before would be just under under 2% then you press the 77,000 then you press the one one ten thousand almost Jimmy via the yo-yo yet what we 're doing maths on the fly with the biggest proposed allocations are excluded for example Shoaib is Arana park they Christchurch Symphony Trust so the amount that you 've got left to take the money from so that 's so it 's up to you as you craft this amendment whether you want to exclude those organizations or where you don 't who is one recomme increase the 12,000 they do mention is a three percent three percent on your sony 5000 we included around the park these figures are kinda okay to any point in this okay let 's let 's just get a check on the answer that we 've received yep but the answer will be the answer the maths will be the maths and then we need to get a firm proposal that we can then debate and take a vote on we need to appreciate that John staff doing work on the fly this afternoon in the face of changes that have been made after a workshop where we 'd already pinned quite a lot of this down what was 5,000 yep so the increase is 5,000 sorry I get 1.2 1.2 all right good so Jimmy now that we 've got the answers of that question what 's the amendment that you 're proposing yep and the funds are coming from with those exceptions okay yep all right so that 's the proposal it 's moved and seconded are there any questions for staff on this Phil no is there any debate on this film it 's unfortunate that they advise the multicolored visor isn 't able to be here but I just see in the report that in fact this is for the number 50 the refugees the resettlement there is a comment that there in fact central government funding isn 't attached to the clients who are going there so I just wanted to comment on there I also think that both that both that that this is a particularly important group refugee and migrants one of the reports here does indicate and I think it 's unfortunate this wasn 't picked up at the workshop but it was it 's quite clear in the report that in fact there was a proposal or for the refugee and at the celebration last last Saturday and so as is indicated in the report tune with a refugee population are going to need a lot of support it 's easy to say that central government should be paying for this we could say they 're actually about every application here but I didn 't hear I hadn 't heard that opposition to us to some and I think it 's important that we keep you vulnerable groups in mind and any assistance that has been offered both refugee resettlement resort centre and the resettlement services have done outstanding work and in terms of supporting very vulnerable people and I 'm really concerned that in fact we not give this full consideration and I ask councilors accordingly to do so including for the next item 50 60 Mike and then Glyn Mike but very similar to the last one and will probably be the same for for the rest I thought I 'd to speak once to an amendment and then to the again if I 'm actually what we 're supporting we 've already shaved off quite a bit from them it 's just not the right thing to do we went through a workshop we worked it all out and there was plenty of time and those workshops to discuss things it was not rushed it was talked through very well so I will not be supporting this amendment Thank You Glenn thank you on I can 't support it there 's a slight element of a bit of a Pyrrhic victory in some of these because if you support this it comes at the price of eg one of the groups it 's not excluded being the Christchurch Community House so it 's kinda you know one in supporting it in doing that it kind of serves to undermine the other so we might several of us find ourselves in this situation I mean this is the nature of amendments of the type we 're dealing with today Ben thought after the workshop and in the situation that we 're now in so I mean there will be a number of people will take a particular position on these and it 's been indicated because of the the was intended to to resolve the issue that we 're dealing with today okay Jamie my debate on this is actually gonna be a bit along lines with what Glenn 's just said in also Mike and it 's gonna be said once because I 'm gonna take a similar line there any other amendments look Newton 's third law is with each and each action is an equal and opposite reaction and it 's very similar in this case because the opposite reaction as Micah said in also cleaners taking funding off the major organizations and you know we need to remind ourselves these major organizations are the ones that are priority one isn 't the most important of the important ones here so continually taking if I can let the debate continue thank you that 's not the issue here the issue is that we 've gone through a process that 's been workshop there 's staff recommendation here and look we 've rely on our staff heavily for a lot of things for technical things you you you wouldn 't query the design of surge station or perfectly honest I actually take a tremendous amount of guidance from staff through this process because they know these all my eyes they know these organizations intimately and they are so passionate about what they do and they do a really good job so it 's I don 't take any pleasure in doing this but I just think that we have these major organizations here that priority one that we 've gone through a staff process we 've gone through a governance process around workshop and you know and I think mean just continually been punished the priority ones or the the ones that staff have deemed to be you know that the top priority for other ones that do good things is just not a good process so I won 't be able to support that and I think we need to have a line in the sand and you don 't take any pleasure in doing it but I just think that it 's good governments and governments isn 't always hanging out lowly 's thank you any further debate Pauline the questions been asked you want are Priority One and also a moment we can estimate assume their workload will be more in the more heavy request a 70 ok so Jimmy you 've moved an amendment and it 's been introduced Pauline 's now ask you whether you 'd be willing to vary the amount in your amendment are you willing to do that or not okay thank you all right so is there any further debate on this okay I 'll put the vote all those in favor say aye aye against show of hands yep those in favor show hands one two three four now it 's a loss so that one is lost okay next one 62 christchurch resettlement service this one 's more kind of crucial and important because why the procedure is effective those mental mental problem and also to help them to you know that promote the well-being and resilience the ACH and also la we revealed the past three years or even more because I requests are giving her those information every year we 're gonna find him for name is so 40k and also aware the excellent kind of need to period treatment to help the loss of refugee and their family why and also the moment this hydrogen society of the couple of months they have a twenty forty sixty and also in the future party it is up to the one hungry the refugee will come to the city this one a few the refugee agency I suggest but because our friend is way we 're attractive you know they cut for 37.5% eg I request a 5k can reduce those only the twenty five percent if they to still we reduce the twenty five percent it 's funny okay so you 're proposing to add five thousand yeah yeah on the same basis as previous one with the same exclusion thank you are there any questions on this one is there any debate on this one film look I 'm strongly supporting this as well well most of us were at the workshop and believe we understood it I actually believe we didn 't really there was no clarification at all that in fact the get these the refugee settlement was likely to change it has changed and I think in fairness we really need to support this there information wasn 't here and I will add not everyone was at the workshop and I understand that but programs is for well for women to be able to have their from other ethnic origins together have their own own swimming and that 's part of their culture I really think that we need to support these minority groups and I asked counselors to do so thank you any further debate finally Jimmy is the exclusions so if they were changed I wouldn 't see it as kind of one step forward one back and if you look at for instance if you took them from the art sector my vote might be different it 's gone up arts have gone up a whole percentage from what was requested to recommit the last time they still have quite a big chunk of the overall pie so you know that was changed it probably get my support but the exclusions you have now which is the same as last time I just can 't go with 's been moved and seconded we 've had questions it 's been debated I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye all right against show of hands for the eyes please 1 2 3 4 5 so that 's also lost thank you and then the final amendment which has been signaled prior to the meeting is 107 Glenn this one is yours and indication of a seconder by Dion okay I 'm proposing for this another 2,000 with operatic symphony or opera in the court in the major organizations so from all of the major organizations know these specific ones operatic Symphony opera and court thank you yep all right there any questions on this proposal any debate on this proposal I 'll put it to a vote all those in favor say aye aye against no that 's lost so that 's all the amendments that have been signaled prior to the meeting is there anything the daily body would like to move at this point Sara for a potential amendment not with large amounts of money so there is the potential in this process plan resolutions which is to specifically take out one of these applications and put it to the capital endowment fund we are clear that we don 't need to be waiting to six months that has been done in those in the original resolutions because they have been coming to us and how can we waive the process so I was wondering if there was appetite being that we would be the decision-makers on their particular application to move what people are currently comfortable with which is the 40,000 for scape which we do want to give them to the capital endowment fund inhibit come quickly which would open up 40,000 which would I which in the amendment could go to organizations which we have signaled we would like additional funding for so that is a problem it 's canvassing the room it would depend we maybe get advice on how quickly the application could come because we do want to fund scope it 's clear none of us have moved to get rid of the funding purse guide we really want to fund this organization but it 's one capital endowment fund and depending on how this process we 'd so I 'm just gauging appetite all right are there any questions that you wanted to say up there any questions that you wanted to ask of staff in order just to inform the appetite a little bit how quickly could we get that process done I know that during the long term plan process we got we had one done within three days one application that was done specifically for long term plan capital and for enviro schools was done within a couple of days so I think I mean that 's certainly one of the questions how quickly could it happen the other question that I would have now that it now as well just so that we can get John to comment on both is what the likelihood of something meeting criteria for capital endowment fund would be as well just so that we can get some comment on that so John if you want to speak to this in a general sense addressing the two questions that have been asked the two are intrinsically linked would have to be an application from scape that was received by us that we put forward to you guys the would have to I tripped the switches they are so to engage scape get a valid our application go through the due diligence just strategic alignment but most of the time is financial we don 't want to be recommending poor decisions I would say that you 'd be in a position to make a a final decision in just under a month the enviro schools program came to us yeah and there wasn 't a full application from them to the long term plan but staff were able to do an assessment without further engagement with them or maybe it was a couple of phone calls yeah so I I mean other things we have just simply referred the current applications rather than getting a whole new application from an organization yeah and is it possible to we could just refer this application yeah in a resolution to we wouldn 't want to refer an application directly to the capital endowment fund okay let 's get let 's get the answer to the question from John of them engage appetizer unless there are further questions so John the the process to get a sex successful result will be to engage with escape to get an application that will succeed and has all the information there for counselors to make a decision on the fund then we go through the financial analysis they put it into a meeting into a meeting schedule and we jump it as quickly as possible so my answer was up to a month if it can be three weeks we would certainly aim to do that I 'd hate to create an expectation that we end up with with egg on our face if it can be done sooner we would we just want to do a good job they are and it 's a lot of money and it 's a valuable fund we want to do it well if it takes less time but we certainly would alright so what I don 't want is to get into debate on this what Sarah 's asked is for a gauge of the appetite for it I 'm guessing Sarah you would move it you would have a seconder and then we would debate it so those who do have an appetite for what Sarah is proposing if you could please raise your hands along the lines of either referring scape the scape application to the capital endowment fund or staff working with scape to apply to the caps endowment fund and that would be another at 40,000 to be used for the organizations which we have indicated today all right we 're not debating it all I want is just a what we 're really saying is is there an appetite for Sarah to move there as an amendment so that we all right so is there an appetite for that or is there not so those that do have an appetite for if you could please raise your hands so there isn 't supportive all right so I 'd now call for any further amendments and there are none so we 've now got the reports moved and seconded from the beginning of the meeting that 's now that resolution has now dealt with that have passed so we 've now got a final resolution from this meeting which is capable have been voted on is there any debate on this substantive motion Mike which public funding meeting we realized the amount of funding was not enough to fill the needs of the many organizations and groups that provide valuable services to Christchurch as a result we made the following resolution support and principle raising the amount of community funding available for grant allocations by 10% in a long-term plan financial year 1819 and then inflation adjusted each year after that unfortunately that did not happen at this recent LTP in fact at the end of the next ten years the annual amount is less than today so here we are right now or funding budget that does not even get close to meeting the needs of what we have in front of us this continual flatlining on this phone is hurting these groups who are doing their best for the city while we see well they see their costs continue to rise while always supporting this we need to do better doubt somehow that we need to do better around this funding and I guess we have the fun the council funding review under way for that very purpose but part of that too I think should be how in fact all of the applications and I think the funding review committee needs to refer to this how in fact they will meet our community outcomes and objectives and what we want to achieve because and so that in fact our funding is more targeted and that then that we have a conversation with the community about there so clear because I guess there will always be a limit to the funding that we can find but I 'm certainly agreeing with cancer Davidson that we need to find more a specialist at this time after in terms of the the psychosocial issues that our community here thank you although the kind of reference information however between between the two data are the funding the decision-making the meeting and also the workshop aware during the workshop several hours with review all those information quite comprehensive information we raise the some allocation to today I still not get the together the information so so I suggested next year we in the final meeting should be a race a couple of couple the weeks until staff you know to keep us all those the information we make those decision there is more kind of vital reliable so I 'm concerned that this time actually summer issue partly we play the role we are more merciful thank you around this table the politicians have found it hard to do to try and work out how we can support those groups which we feel are really important to our communities over other groups that are also important to their communities so as hard as it was for us I can only imagine how hard it is for you working with those groups face to face so I really applaud you for the work that you have done and the good information and the passion that you provide so thank you very much following on from what I 'm council Davidson said yeah we I think there are some new is that we to look at product and we 've got to find some serious and after Arya 's areas that we can move I 've got one in mind which I 'll talk offline maybe next Tuesday which I was a great supporter of and recently this bit of information that came through which was could be seen as great I think it 's a more disconnection from our community and I 'd be more than happy to pull the funding from that and put it into this and our communities where it as needed thank you thank you some process at the moment because I think we 've got some really big issues here we need to address we 're all very uncomfortable with this process and not happy with the fact that we are having to do this bidding war against everybody needs the money I 'd really like to recommend that our community advisers be involved in the funding review they 've got the feet on the ground they know exactly what 's happening it would be very good to hear advice and experience in this discussion and I 'd also like doesn 't always mean a better income for exact I 'm sorry for example with the street begging situation a million dollars 17 staff on on the ground doing that they still haven 't solved the problem in Christchurch here we 've got a fantastic partnership happening that actually isn 't involved much more money but is involved working together and actually bringing resources that are already out there to give us so I think we need to really look at this whole issue in a very creative way thank you deal I just wanted to echo what Tim said and say thank you to all the staff for the amazing work that you have done I can 't imagine how you know when we 're discussing that here that you know you guys are talking to these applicants and it 's you 're going to have to go back to some of those people and sort of give them the news that they 're not going to get what they they needed in some cases to survive and I just wanted to sort of also say you know echo of the organizations that I 'm I know not necessarily the ones here are all facing challenges and funding and most of them are facing challenges in funding because of the increased costs the constantly increasing in costs in terms of the regulations and and complying with different things and health and safety X and all those kind of things that are always on top on top on top in the burden of that is all coming down to what we 're seeing now and it 's really not good actually I mean it 's ridiculous when you want to hold a street party that might cost 500 bucks but you 've got to get a twenty thousand dollar traffic management plan I mean it 's just ridiculous and all these things you know these these comply you know these are compiled start again these are compounding on our communities and the actual money that goes into our communities is less at least less so I think even if we put more money from the council it 's still probably is going to end up as less money actually on us you know especially us around the table here as governors need to think how can we do this differently that actually means money that we 're putting into these community organizations ends up on the ground because there 's no point in giving more money and it just goes into another business that 's actually taking another chunk of the money for another compliance cost on top of them not on top of them top of it 's just unsustainable and ridiculous but again thank you very much everybody out there who 's done the work please pass on our thanks to your teams as well because it 's a collective a collective work and the money that is going out today will make a difference to our community so thank you clear yeah thank you wish to advance staff in colleagues obviously it 's a challenging situation and we can end up and effectively a bidding war and it can you know put you against colleagues but also against yourself so in my previous life I came from their ethos I 'm sorry sorry but I 'm talking refugee I 'm face today with do I choose between refugees or means Welfare Fund which I can 't vote on well Christchurch community yes it 's a hell of a situation to be put in and quite frankly I don 't get in that situation again so I just want to say look can we try and not so much just workshop the amounts but we shot the processor here so we all have different in similar value systems you know mine yours some some are some different but I think it 's got to be a way that we aren 't actually put in what I think are these invidious situations yeah I mean this is it is a challenging process it 's a challenging set of decisions to make I think regardless of what process you ran to get to it would be challenging I always find these meetings difficult and challenging to to chair because of course you have got exactly the balancing act and exactly the conflicts which have been described so well by a number of people around this table this afternoon and it by so many different groups many of them volunteer groups across so many different sectors all of which I 've got good outcomes and it 's very difficult to balance one set of outcomes against another when you 're looking at you know quite different outcomes across different sectors and I think one of the things that comes out of this for me is the huge amount of work which is done by a large number of organizations in our community all of which is valuable and of course what we 've got to do in these meetings in a constrained funding environments is to decide which of those is more worthy of funding than the other or which of those is more valuable to our communities than the other and it 's a near-impossible set of decisions to make the funding review has been referred to and my hope is that that funding review will result in a more strategic approach to the way that we make funding decisions a more joined up process with other funders in the city and quite possibly a more joined up process around so that we get the best value from the amount of funding that we are putting into our communities I 'd also like to echo with the thanks to to staff I 'm aware of the huge amount of work that 's done before we get to the staff recommendations I 'm also very aware of and very appreciative of the work that 's done often in a very reactive way to sometimes unexpected proposals that come out in the workshop and and and meetings like this one and I 'd like to thank John Nicola and the people that are in the room and your colleagues for supporting us so well in the decision making that you know we 've we 've already alluded to has been quite difficult and without the support that you provide it would be even more difficult than we found it so thank you very much indeed for both the preparation and the reactive work that you 've undertaken as part of these meetings and in preparation for them we 've arrived at a set of recommendations that 's what we 're we 're moment I think it 's fair to say through this process we 're never going to be able to keep everybody absolutely happy but you know certainly there has been some some good consideration and debate both through the workshop and through this meeting today and as has already been said the decision that we 're about to make is the result of that process it is what it is and we know that the funding that goes out to the community organisations that we are funding we 'll be well used and we 'll deliver good results there 's no question about that from the conversations that we 've had as we 've gone through the process Sara Dave okay so Dave and then Sara sentiments read the staff input to this versus mine for a few years that we have successively over a number of years now reduced our level of strengthening communities funding and there 's the pressure on a number of their community groups has increased as a consequence I think the Chairman also alluded at a moment ago to being collaborative in our approach going talking to our the other funders in the city but also I think you know we we need to look at the other prime source of funding in their City as the gaming industry and we as a council have the sinking blood policy so on the one hand we are reducing our own funding to the community on the next we are and the the other trusts and organizations around the country and the city are finding increasing pressures on their funding so we need to think when we 're doing this funding review a very holistic approach across all sectors of funding in our community and that 's something I 'll certainly we have the coding when that comes around thank you Sara thank you this has been a difficult at times fruit meeting there are so many fantastic organizations and occations they have hundreds of volunteers in tins and that tens of thousands of hours of work in our communities they meet all the criteria for funding contribute to the social and environmental well-being and vibrancy of our city and are all deserving of our support council 're not able to apply to the community board and we have not made use of the other funding opportunities available to us which we specifically resolved funding to be available for and we chose this Jamie said earlier in this meeting if we could fund this we would and you know what we could have councils it 's kinder and others have thanked staff and drew attention to the very tough job that they had had to do and I do too but we are the ones who have made their job harder by not giving them the resources needed to fulfill the needs of our communities we went through this exact the same thing last year and you decided unanimously that increasing the level of funding available would be an excellent idea we resolved to 18% unanimously and yet a few months later we decided that supporting our community groups to build social capital resilience in cultural vibrancy wasn 't as important as for example providing grants to private heritage building owners councillor gonna wager attention to the funding review and we stablished it at this very meeting will bring the strategic and political leans that counselors cotta into not mentioned council Livingston found it hard to choose between refugee services the Me 's Welfare Fund and Community House and we shouldn 't have to I did consider putting a new amendment to the meeting to increase our community funding but past experience has shown that while we are willing to carry through simply isn 't there thank you I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye hi against that 's carried thank you very much indeed and once again just echoing our thanks to staff for all the work that you 've put into this and I 'll declare the meeting closed thank you you you _"

    "text": "item three the Metropolitan strengthening communities fund so just to make some introductory comments staff have worked on a number of applications which have been through a council workshop the recommendations coming to this meeting a combination of those stat recommendations amended with the guidance and input from that councillors workshop so that 's the basis of the meeting today our role today is to consider any amendments and a number have been signaled and then come to a final recommendation which will be voted on and at the end of this meeting approved and that 's what will be implemented by staff so Nicola welcome to the table it might be good for us to take some comment from staff on this if there is any comment and then we 'll move to any general questions and then we 'll move into considering any amendments to the recommendation that 's in front of us so Nicola if you 've got any general comments that you wanted to make at this time thank you whose projects contribute to the strengthening of community well-being and Christchurch successful organizations are those who a significant presence in the community of benefit all applications to the fund must demonstrate sound governance appropriate financial management and you put reporting practices they must have the operational capability and capacity to deliver the outcomes that is agreed of the 2018-19 metropolitan stressing communities fund to support this process we provided information the council outcomes in priorities the strengthening communities fund criteria and a decision matrix document which outlines the requests being sought from the fund the matrix details the exocrine grant requests the core organization details staff assessment and grant recommendation all applications presented to the year today have gone through a process of assessment firstly by individual advisers followed by a collective review at a staff collaboration meeting all of the applications have been assessed as either a priority one two three or four priority one applications are those that we consider contribute significantly to funding outcomes and priorities and applications that we have recommended to find well priority 2 application contribute ease but not as closely as those that are priority one these are applications we are recommending making a contribution towards priority three applications these are applications there if we had all the money in the world we would like to make a contribution towards but unfortunately we can 't priority for applications are also not recommended for funding there are assessed to have a minimum contribution to funding outcomes and priorities or they may have insufficient information provided to make an assessment that is after their application is considered end through the requests for information have been made or it may be that other sources of funding that are considered more appropriate entitle we have 190 Metropolitan applications with requests totaling over eight million dollars there were no ineligible application was received to the fund this year start recommending 12 applications for funding for two-year funding and these are highlighted for you in pink honorable spreadsheets the total budget available for all 190 applications to be considered today is three million one hundred and sixty four thousand seven hundred and eighty nine dollars Stafford made recommendations totaling three million one hundred and fifty three thousand three hundred and seventy four dollars as you 'll see on the spreadsheet a change has been made of you will also help you keep track of your decisions thank you very much indeed so at this point I 'm happy to take any general questions so not questions on specific applications which Nicola will be able to answer so Sarah first of all those three ones if we had all the money in the world but actually they meet all our funding criteria currently and it wouldn 't need it 's really all the funding in the world but just some if we had more council funding available we would choose to fund some of those because they do contribute to all of the outcomes that we 're looking for Jimmy wanting precious I send an email to you in the young Jaffa so we got into the within the multicultural sectors I compared this coming year in the previous year which project or projects has been reduced or i got a reprieve from you you know maybe take a week I just don 't know how to reach in there can neither gather this information so Jimmy I 'm going to ask John Phil cell to we we got the requests and an each request we provided as much information as we possibly could the we did make it clear that the reason we couldn 't provide the rest would be the time and resource taken to do that and we also gave a few points on the relevance of the information that you were that you were asking for so the reason we couldn 't do it is one the very short notice the one request came in essentially this morning and the rest was a a couple of duck the other one was a couple of days ago we 've done what we can but we we can 't do any more in the timeframe and we sought to give you some information back on the value and the relevance of all of the information you are asking for so we we haven 't got that information we can 't provide it thank you so I 've got Phil Glen and then back to Sarah Phil thanks Nicola can you discuss an indication like we 're the group is withdrawal and like it has us what sort of priority of funding they had been eligible for I couldn 't understand of for the whole time this level for metropolitan funds is usually around if we 've granted multi-year funding if there 's any other funding that we 've had to take thank you it 's useful to know probably an annual plan consideration so yeah thank you for that thank you Sarah back to you thank you last year when we came to this we also had applications for some of these organizations being considered by the committee resilience of partnership funding and we 're currently not doing that for some of these applications we 're also not looking at the capital endowment fund which we had allowed the inflation adjustment to be used for community purposes and there 's hundreds of thousands of dollars sitting in there so why are we not looking at those funds for some of us when we quite Street I 'm gonna say it was possibly tow organizations currently going to come to us and if we had organizations do we have organizations in here that would meet I know that in the count and the long term plan it was a resolution for teachers around the state that would potentially meet those and sorry I 'm going to allow the question I 'm going to allow the question so capital endowment funding was specifically set aside some for community purposes and we hit that funding available and there are organizations in here which we could potentially have funded through that instead of strengthening communities would you mind if I you know because we didn 't yeah like firstly the chairs reminded me we we did cover this at the workshop yep secondly they you know more information was going to come to us so that we could approach this for doing that yeah the the capital endowment fund operates there 's an application that 's put to it considered by the council in its own merits so if there was after this strengthening communities allocation process an organization that felt that it wish to make an application to the capital endowment fund there are very welcome to do that through through our funding team so a broad-brush allocated on whether that 's an option yet probably you can 't make but certainly arising from this an organization could feel that it so it should take this course of action one thing that we are very conscious of is the council have approved a set of money to be allocated through this process and we would like to follow that out and get your assistance in doing that we have staff have already gone through a process we they 've said well actually it 's that might suit the resilience fund in so actually we 're not bringing them to council we 've talked to those organizations did we consider doing a process that was similar with any organizations here for the capital endowment fan widows organizations were offered the opportunity to go through that fund as well no we didn 't and the reason that we didn 't do that at the time was the staff that the funder opened in last financial year and all of these are recommendations and decision-making matrices were done before counsel had made changes to the capital and diamond farm so and you know the staff recommendations were what they were coming to the workshop taking into account those things that staff and me John you 've made some comment on this felt were appropriate to take into account in the environment that they were working in at that time the workshop yes you know the the issues area that you 've raised today was raised at that time and we 've had some further information on that now I 've got a number of amendments that people have signaled that we 're going to consider at the meeting this afternoon and none of those at this stage is referring any applications to the capital endowment fund so that would be the way to deal with this if that 's what you were wanting to do so just one last thing organizations that do get funding today are they eligible and would they meet criteria to apply for additional funding through the Kepler down and fund yes thank you so now I 've got Tim and Phil and I 'm reasonably keen to move on to deal with some of these the amount and you were saying in 2010 available that it was reduced from 10 to around 10 million to 7.2 so following the earthquake so it hasn 't changed from that 7.2 could we also get an idea of the increase in groups that have been asking for funding because there 's a two-way thing here one is the amount that we 've had and it 's been reduced prior to the earthquake and the the amount of need because we 've got groups like you know get following others that have been created the heat from that who are also going into the thank you and then finally Phil no exigent I 'm John as answered my so you 're happy that 's great all right so if we can now move on from general questions I 've got a number of amendments that have been signaled and what I 'm gonna do is take the amendments in the order in which they were signaled so there were there has been the opportunity since the workshop for councilors through a process to signal those by email and a so I 'm going to take the amendments in the order in which they 've been signaled which means that the first amendment that we 'll deal with is an amendment from David East what I 'm going to do is to get each person moving an amendment to get a seconder at that point just a very brief introduction a kind of no more than two minutes introduction as to the purpose of the amendment and what 's intended then they 'll be the opportunity to ask questions to staff if required and then we 'll debate if required and take a vote on each amendments I 'm keen to keep this as short and concise a process as it can be given that this has already been through a workshop so any amendments really just changes further too as a result of further considerations or in date space because he wasn 't_''_1065.16 out of the workshop so Dave sorry just all right so apparently what we need to do is to get the staff report moved and seconded before we go into the amendments so Tim is happy if we can then take a vote on this No so just moved and seconded all right so moved and seconded desserts the staff report so now we 're taking so now we 're taking amendments so Dave I 'll come to you for the first amendment and if you can detail the application numbers speak to it briefly and then we 'll run through the process I described I thank you mr. chairman I think we 're working [Music] one seven eight and apologies I was enabled to be here for the earlier workshop I 'm putting forward this application because I feel that it in the city it 's one that resonates quite well with the aspirations of this fund and it caters specifically for access to the beach for disabled people and of disability in providing access the beach for the wheelchair walking Stokes practice all sorts of things and there was a trial last year with a fairly narrow map that was quite coarse it was extremely successful and I think I 'm very keen to see this fund of this application be funded to a to this this application and I believe here of Templeton 's heavy to suit endure okay so this amendments moved by David East seconded by sarah temple term and the we 've captured the amendment few technical issues here okay so the amendment is to add five thousand and one dollars to 178 taking that from the balance which we have got on the spreadsheet are described in the opening comments so moved and seconded is there any debate on this all right so I 'll take a vote all those in favor say aye all right against so that one 's carried thank you okay so next I 'll come to an amendment that 's been signaled by Pauline Cotter and seconded by Phil Clearwater Pauline increased in thousand the original application and what they have been receiving for a few years on the council has been 30,000 and that 's mainly for the administrators salary now to receive team as a considerable decrease and I think the projects will be honest I think that 's great fits in with a lot of the council 's activities in our keeping our city clean in our waterways and and also with 35 to 40 schools they 've got great programs I think that if we can keep them up to 20,000 again that 's a reduction of 30% of what they 've historically been receiving so I yep so Clearwater indicated he was second yes thank you are there any questions for staff on this one Jamie we add money you need to take it from so Pauline 's suggestion as to where the money comes from so I 'm suggesting we shade it from their group so you 're suggesting Pauline that the funding the 10,000 that you 're wanting to add to keep Christchurch beautiful be taken proportionately from a number of the major organizations is that all of the major organizations or just some so what percentage is that often I would have actually plumped for the 5,000 that was surplus but it 's a pretty strange process so that 's gone just through the luck of the drill I think that we would have sit here and go through all the other recommendations and start packing very long time resolution so this to me is the easiest way that if these amendments providing they don 't end up to an enormous figure and we they may not that would be a tiny but those ones nothing that 's the easiest way to go about three percent of those I 'm looking at keep quite Shakespeare was potentially falling over the money that they have listed in the report is for the slow Jordan of whose summary the lady that was the administrator and once that 's gone that 'll be the end of their a quite a strong group they 're giving stronger and they have really good branding and identity under a national umbrella and I thought I 'd be doing very well to support this group in partner with them to help achieve their own goals so I 'm looking for them reducing in by only 30 percent not seventy-five dissented alright so the amendment is clear are they further questions for staff on this Glenn we just please be clear on the organizations for which aren 't excluded in other words those from do that so it 's all of the major organizations with the exception of show biz so Symphony Orchestra Ferry Mead and around a park so that 's the amendment okay can I speak to yep once we 're done with questions then we 'll move to debate no further questions Jamie staff going to write that up because you know I don 't think anyone 's doubting um you know the quality of debate with the argument for that it 's just I guess more a procedural thing that we really good to see exactly what their percentages in and all terms what that means for those all right so John 's in a position to give an indication that this is a dynamic environment it 's difficult to come up with exact numbers but John is able to give an indicative amount which hopefully Jamie will go some way to asking the question that you 've answered in question that you 've asked John it 's about 3% 3% yep so if all of the amendments that are going to be put this after yeah if all of are going to be put this afternoon were to be carried the effect on the major organizations indicative Lee would be around 3% oh sorry and that 's just for that that one individually just this one yeah 3% from the staff recommendation correct so would be good before we start doing these individually to realize that impact because every single member now is going to be wanting to shave off money from these major organizations yeah I mean give me the sentiment are you hearing around the room calling is there something else that you 're comfortable with putting this amendment the way that you 're crafting it no no I took the amendments in the order they were signaled the amendment that we took first was the only amendments that had come by email prior to the informal discussion that occurred prior to this meeting where the person who had sent the email was also present at that meeting so are strictly I 'm taking the amendments in the order that they 've been signaled starting with emails that were received according to the process that was out not really getting a feeling that there 's a lot of support for this around the table so I 'm wondering with the perhaps we should try I don 't know what the process from you is to mean the amount yeah I mean you you may want to just put the amendment the approval you 've got an amendment which you 've moved in it 's called a seconder seventeen and a half okay that 's fine so the amendment is seventeen and a half thousand from the major organizations that have been signaled bullying you 've spoken to it there any further questions Dave by three at three percent on all major organizations you 've got another a number of other signaled amendments if there were all but that was just for that this particular and that was three percent of all of the organization 's they the amendment proposed by councilor kata excluded a number of those organizations thus the residual percentage is higher for the ones that are left yeah okay all right so we 've we 've got an amendment which if you moved and want to support this I think it 's well known that keep clay ships beautiful have been the umbrella organization for a whole lot of clean up parts of our city for a long time and I think we owe it to them not not to cut the the leading coordinator celery an effect that kind of thing to cut to the chase but I just think that know so much has developed well kcb being the umbrella that week as a city can be proud of and I think it 's not a good time to actually make a reduction so that 's why I 'm very supportive of the reduced amendment that and there Pauline has put forward thank you Sarah thank you you know the same thing almost every organization and that list we have we cut them all last year we 've cut them all again this year and I can 't support doing that for one organization over another organization that is just as valuable in a city I 'm sorry Glenn thank you we know I disagree with this we 're not look at can speak about one of them and not the other but they both relate to the community sector and we 've just had the the full well beings you know they 're going to be restored this runs against that and I don 't see why you would cut funding for instance from Christchurch Community House and so it 's on those grounds that you know I 'm gonna vote against us thank you Tim and then I 'll come back to you Pauline at the end of the movie you know I think you agree with what serie saying every one of these organizations and their staff said and especially their threes we if we had the money we would be giving them to them and they staff would be recommending that but you know the other side of this is if we really talked about shaving and shaving off the ones and pink they are large organizations generally who do really really good work and if you look at the amount that their projects are costing that they 're undertaking the amount that they are requesting but the be given are hugely different to what the what they 've requested so we keep shaving off these guys it does fit them so that hurts these guys as much as everybody or anybody else where they 're a size or as taken into account everything is important so I 'll be voting against this mean that thank you okay pulling back to you and then we 'll take a vote I just come back to the effect that to reduce an organization by 75% with the stroke of a pen was no warning and the organization to potentially cease I know they 'll be determined to look around for money but it does put a lot of strain in there and you know everybody is tight all the other organizations I just think that 's very harsh from this council I mean we 'd be given to support these people and actually work with them and help them to help us to deliver our own strategic goals which is cleaning up the city how many how many times do we sit around here must think the council is complaining grassroots doing it and yes yes the big organization is a really really important I 'd like to give way more as well but I think the small grassroots organizations this one 's running on 30,000 a year in a ton of volunteer hours and this administrator does a ton of more work than she actually is paid for so it 's that kind of gold you 've got there and I think these are equally with supporting as well so they 'll be even if I mean that does pass and I do hope it does they 're being reduced by probably around 35% to 40% now so I think we need to be there so I do hope all right so I 'll put the vote which all those in favor say aye all right against can I have a show of hands for the eyes 1 2 3 4 5 so that 's lost okay moving on to the next one Canterbury resettlement Resource Center so Jimmy this is yours I 've got a note that it 's moved by you Jimmy seconded by Anne could you thank you the increase from the original 15k to the 20k increase a moment so I suggest the male working together with the minister immigration last Saturday petechia emphasized I 'll church as a city resettlement center again since the 2011 earthquake and also council we have launched the multicultural strategy for most one year I will build a funk in the twenty all those one before the we launched this one and after we launched this one particular focus on the multicultural sector no any increase those families feel still the same of Fundy and we compared lost ratio a moment 25% percent is in relation to the multi multi culture group for fundings only around the 10 percent only the other ones we can assume know after a long study stir kind of touches our city of refugee resettlement center the walk lawful Easter ago who will be increases significantly so that you we trapped at a 25 percent because the 20k our 5k know then how they can make the happen last year pew is you always a 20k so this my recommendation alright thank you so the source of the additional funding so what we 're looking at here in front of us here in the workshop it was a percentage of major organizations yeah they seems you wanting to take the funding from proportionately across the way but he comes in the showpiece maybe one may be poor in the fight to think Amina needs I just want to know so your proposal Jimmy is potentially to exclude the four projects that you 've just named yeah okay we need a firm amendment as to where the funds are coming from well no maybe you can move an amendment which has got a clear recommendation is found that 's what we need I mean if you need some staff advice in order to determine that that may be what you 're about to get but we we needed a firm amendment so that people can choose whether to vote on it or not all right Jones just working on the answer yeah just working on it yeah okay so Tim we 'll take your questions and then John will provide the advice that Jimmy 's refugees etc what part does the government pay financially with regards to that there was a ball on the council to fund these sorts of groups and that would be sorry mr. chairman yeah that would be the same thing for the Christchurch resettlement services which is going to presume again becoming the extra Chet and Jimmy put up all right thank you thank you John 's got Nansen answer the question Jimmy that you asked and then we need to really pin down what your amendment is okay so it 's on the wanting to take the funds off if you exclude before would be just under 70 70 the the yep what we 're doing maths on the fly here but you have to understand that the organizations with the biggest proposed allocations are excluded for example Shoaib is Arana Park the Christchurch Symphony Trust so the amount that you 've got left to take the money fronds less so it 's up to you as you craft this amendment whether you want to exclude those organisations or where you don 't who is one recommend increasing dollars only 5000 we included around a partial do these figures are gangs okay to any point in this thing okay let 's let 's just get a check on the answer that we 've received yep but the answer will be the answer the maths will be the maths and then we need to get a firm proposal that we can then debate and take a vote on we need to appreciate that John staff doing work on the fly this afternoon in the face of changes that have been made after a workshop where we 'd already pinned quite a lot of this down first was 4,000 yep so the increase is 5,000 sorry I get one point to 1.8 last time but it 's for 1.2 all right good so Jimmy know that we 've got the answer to that question what 's the amendment that you 're proposing yep and the funds are coming from with those exceptions okay yep all right so that 's the proposal it 's moved and seconded are there any questions for staff on this film no is there any debate on visor isn 't able to be here but I just see in the report that in fact this is for the number 50 the refugees of resettlement there is a comment that there in fact central government funding isn 't attached to the clients who are going there so I just wanted to comment on that I also think that both both that that this is a particularly important group refugee and migrants one of the reports here does indicate and I think it 's unfortunate this wasn 't picked up at the workshop but it was it 's quite clear in the report that in fact there was a proposal or for the refugee and migrant quota coming to Christchurch and some of us were at the celebration last last Saturday and so as is indicated in the report tune with a refugee population are going to need a lot of support it 's easy to say that simple government should be paying for this we could say they 're actually about every application here but I didn 't hear I hadn 't heard that opposition to us to you vulnerable groups in mind and any assistance that has been offered both refugee resettlement Resource Center and the resettlement services have done outstanding work and in terms of supporting very vulnerable people and I 'm really concerned that in fact we not give this full consideration and I ask councilors accordingly to do so including for the next item 50 60 Mike and then Glenn Mike the last one the same for the rest I thought I 'd just speak once to an amendment and then speak unify actually what we 're supporting we 've already shaved off quite a bit from the major organizations and for some reason we keep targeting them it 's just not the right thing to do we went through a workshop we worked at the lat and there was plenty of time and those workshops to discuss this it was not rushed it was talked through very well so I will not be supporting this amendment Thank You Glenn thank you on I can 't support it there 's a slight element of a bit of a Pyrrhic victory in some of these of eg one of the group 's it 's not excluded being the Christchurch community yes so it 's kinda you know one in supporting it in doing that it kind of serves to you know undermine the other so we might several of us find ourselves in this situation and I mean this is the nature of amendments of the type we 're dealing with today been taught after the workshop and in the situation that we 're now in so I mean there will be a number of people will take a particular position on these and it 's been indicated because of the the fact that these have come after the process that really was intended to to resolve the issue that we 're dealing with today okay Jamie my debate on this is actually going to be a bit along lines of what cleans just said in also Mike and it 's gonna be see it once because I 'm gonna take a similar line for any other amendments look Newton 's third law is with each and each action is an equal and opposite reaction opposite reaction as Micah said in also cleaners taking funding off the major organizations and you know we need to remind ourselves these major organizations are the ones that are priority one isn 't the most important of the important ones here so continually taking if I can let the debate continue thank you that 's not the issue here the issue is that we 've gone through a process that 's been workshop there 's staff recommendation here and look we 've rely on our staff heavily for a lot of things for technical things you you you wouldn 't query the design of surge station or surge pumps or any person to be perfectly honest I actually take a tremendous amount of guidance from staff through this process because they know these all my eyes they know these organizations intimately and they are so passionate about what they do and they do a really good job so it 's I don 't take any pleasure in doing this but I just think that we have these major organizations here that priority one that we 've gone through a workshop and you know and I think mean just continually been punished the priority ones or the the ones that staff have deemed to be you know that the top priority for other ones that do good things is just not a good process so I won 't be able to support that and I think we need to have a line in the sand and you don 't take any pleasure in doing it but I just think that it 's good governments and governments isn 't always hanging out lowly 's thank you any further debate Pauline the questions been asked you want to give an answer I would like to emphasize these are Priority One and also a moment we can estimate assume their workload will be more in the more heavy request a 70 ok so Jimmy you 've moved an amendment and it 's been introduced Pauline 's now ask you whether you 'd be willing to vary the amount in your amendment are you willing to do that or not okay thank you all right so is there any further debate on this okay aye aye against show of hands yep those in favor show hands one two three four now it 's a loss so that one is lost okay next one 62 christchurch resettlement service this one 's more kind of crucial and important because why the procedure is effective those refugee and family mental mental problem and also to help them to you know that promote the well-being and resilience the ACH and also la we revealed the past three years or even more because I requests are giving her those information every year we 're gonna find him for name is so 40k and also we 're excellent job particular for lost the mental problem this long-term the kinda need to period treatment to help the loss of refugee and their family why and also the moment this hydrogen society of the couple of months they have a twenty forty sixty and also in the future party it is up to the one hungry the refugee will come to the city this one a few the refugee agency I suggest but because our friend is way be retracted it is a 5k can reduce those only the twenty five percent if they still we reduce the 25 percentage if only 5k_._3216.81 so you 're proposing to add five thousand yeah on the same basis as previous one with the same exclusion thank you are there any questions on this one is there any debate on this one Phil look I 'm strongly supporting this as well well most of us were at the workshop and believe we understood it I actually believe we didn 't really there was no clarification at all that in fact the get these the refugee settlement was likely to change by the end of this year and since that workshop it has changed and I think in fairness we really need to support this their information wasn 't here and I will add not everyone was at the workshop and I understand that but programs is for women to be able to have their from other ethnic origins to be able have their own own swimming and that 's part of their culture I really think that we need to support these minority groups and debate finally Jimmy is the exclusions so if they were changed I wouldn 't see it as kind of one step forward one back and if you look at for instance if you took them from the art sector my vote might be different it 's gone up arts have gone up a whole percentage from what was requested to recommit the last time they still have quite a big chunk of the overall pie so you know that was changed it probably get my support but the exclusions you have now which is the same as last time I just can 't go with thank you all right so we 've got an amendment who 's been moved and seconded we 've had questions it 's been debated I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye all right against show of hands for the eyes please 1 2 3 4 5 so that 's also lost thank you and then the final amendment which has been signaled prior to the meeting is 107 Glen this one is yours and indication of a seconder by Dion okay or opera in the court in the major organizations so from all of the major organizations know these specific ones operatic Symphony opera and court thank you yep all right there any questions on this proposal any debate on this proposal I 'll put it to a vote all those in favor say aye aye against no that 's lost so that 's all the amendments that have been signal prior to the meeting is there anything else that anybody would like to move at this point Sara for a potential amendment not with large amounts of money so there is the potential in this process for us to do what was signaled in our long-term plan resolutions which is to specifically take out one of these applications and put it to the cabin on down and fund we are clear that we don 't need to be waiting to six months that has been done and those in the original resolutions because they have been coming to us a Adha can we waive the process so I was wondering if there was appetite being that we would be the currently comfortable with which was the 40,000 for scape which we do want to give them to the capital endowment fund and have that come quickly which would open up 40,000 which would I which in the amendment could go to organizations which we have signaled we would like additional funding for so that is a its canvassing the room it would depend we maybe get advice on how quickly the application could come because we do want to fund escape it 's clear none of us have moved to get rid of the funding prescribed we really want to fund this organization but it 's one that God signaled in the mayor 's recommendations for potential capital endowment funding depending on how this process we 'd so I 'm just gauging appetite all right are there any questions that you wanted to say up there any questions that you wanted to ask of staff in order just to inform the appetite a little bit how quickly could we get that process done I know that during the long term plan process we got through we had one done within capital and down in funding for enviro skulls was done within a couple of days so I think I mean that 's certainly one of the questions how quickly could it happen the other question that I would have now at it now as well just so that we can get John to comment on both is what the likelihood of something meeting criteria for capital endowment fund would be as well just so that we can get some comment on that so John if you want to speak to this in a general sense addressing the two questions that there 's the two are intrinsically linked because the nature of the application from scape and it would have to be an application from scape that was received by us that we put forward to you guys they would have to I tripped the switches they are so to engage scape get a valid our application go through the due diligence just strategic alignment but most of the time is financial we don 't want to be recommending poor decisions I would say that you be in a position to the enviro Schools program came to us yeah and there wasn 't a full application from them to the long-term plan yeah but staff were able to do an assessment without through their engagement with them or maybe it was a couple of phone calls yeah so I mean other things we have just simply referred the current applications rather than getting a whole new application from an organization yeah and is that possible we could just refer this application we wouldn 't want to refer an application to write me to the capital endowment fund okay let 's get the answer from John all right let 's get the answer to the question from John of them engage appetite unless there are further questions so John the the process to get a sex successful result will be to engage with escape to get an application that will succeed and has all the information there for counselors to make a decision on the fund then we go through the financial analysis they put it into a meeting into a meeting schedule and we jump it as quickly as possible so be three weeks we would certainly aim to do that I 'd hate to create an expectation that we end up with with egg on our face if it can be done sooner we would we just want to do a good job they are and it 's a lot of money and it 's a valuable fund we want to do it well if it takes less time but we certainly would alright so what I don 't want us to get into debate on this what Sarah 's asked is for a gauge of the appetite of the meeting and then if there was an appetite for it I 'm guessing Sarah you would move it you would have a seconder and then we would debate it so those who do have an appetite for what Sarah is proposing if you please raise your hands along the lines of either referring scape the scape application to the capital endowment fund or staff working with scape to apply to the caps endowment fund and that would be another at forty thousand dollars to be used for the organizations which alright we 're not debating it all I want is just a what we 're really saying is is there an appetite for Sarah to move there as an amendment so that we all right so is there an appetite for that or is there not so those that do have an appetite for if you could please raise your hands so there isn 't supportive all right so I 'd now call for any further amendments and there are none so we 've now got the reports moved and seconded from the beginning of the meeting that 's now that resolution has now been amended by any of the amendments that we have dealt with that have passed so we 've now got a final resolution from this meeting which is capable have been voted on is there any debate on this substantive motion Mike Mitchell in funding meeting we realized the amount of funding was not enough to fill the needs of the many organizations and groups that provide valuable services to Christchurch as a result we made the following resolution support and principle raising the amount of a long-term plan financial year 18 19 and then inflation adjusted each year after that unfortunately that did not happen at this recent LTP in fact at the end of the next ten years their annual amount is less than today so here we are right now or a funding budget that does not even get close to meeting the needs of what we have in front of us this continual flatlining of this fund is hurting these groups who are doing their best for the city while we see well they see their costs continue to rise while always supporting this we need to do better I don 't disagree with that I 've got no doubt somehow that we need to do better around this funding and I guess we have the fun the council funding review underway for that very purpose but part of that too I think should be how in fact all of the applications and I think the funding review committee needs to refer to this how in fact they will meet our community outcomes and objectives and what we want to achieve because and that then that we have a conversation with the community about there so in fact it becomes clear because I guess there will always be Elementor the funding that we can find but I 'm certainly agreeing with cancer Davidson that we need to find more a specialist at this time after in terms of the the psychosocial issues that our community here thank you although the kind of reference information however between between the two data are the funding the decision-making the meeting and also the workshop aware during the workshop several hours with review all those information quite comprehensive information we raise the some allocation issues however because just within the several days even up to today I still not here the to gather the information so so I suggested next year in the final meeting should be a race a couple of couple weeks until staff in order to keep us all those the information we make those decision there is more kind of title reliable so I 'm concerned that this time actually several issue partly we played along we are more merciful thank you do to try and work out how we can support those groups which we feel are really important to our communities over other groups that are also important to their communities so as hard as it was for us I can only imagine how hard it is for you working with those groups face to face so I really applaud you for the work that you 've done and the good information and the passion that you provide so thank you very much following on from what I 'm council Davidson said yeah we I think there are some you is that we 've got to look at in this organization a dollar is a dollar wherever you put it and we 've gotta find some areas and after Arya 's areas that we can move I 've got one in mind but job talk offline maybe next Tuesday which I was a great supporter of and recently this bit of information that came through which was could be seen as great I think it 's a more disconnection from our community and I 'd be more than happy to and our communities where it as needed thank you thank you some process at the moment because I think we 've got some really big issues here we need to address we 're all very uncomfortable with this process I 'm not happy with the fact that we are having to do this bidding war we know everybody needs the money I 'd really like to recommend that our community advisers be involved in the funding review they 've got the feet on the ground they know exactly what 's happening it would be very good to hear their advice and experience in this discussion and I 'd also like to just the challenge I think is money giving money doesn 't always mean it 'd be like income for exact I 'm sorry but for example with the street leaking situation a million dollars seventeen staff on on the ground doing that they still haven 't solved the problem in Christchurch here we 've got a fantastic partnership happening that actually hasn 't involved much more money but he 's involved working together and actually bringing resources that are need to really look at this whole issue in a very creative way thank you deal I just wanted to echo what Tim said and say thank you to all the staff for the amazing work that you have done I can 't imagine how you know when we 're discussing that here that you know you guys are talking to these applicants and it 's you know gonna have to go back to some of those people and sort of give them the news that they 're not going to get what they they needed in some cases to survive and I just wanted to sort of also say you know echo kind of what councillor Galloway as soon as a number of the organizations that I 'm I know not necessarily the ones here are all facing challenges and funding in most of them are facing challenges in funding because of the increased costs the constantly increasing in costs in terms of the regulations and and in complying with different things and health and safety X and all those kind of things that are always on top on coming down to what we 're seeing now and it 's really not good actually I mean it 's ridiculous when you want to hold a street party that might cost 500 bucks but you 've got to get a twenty thousand dollar traffic management plan I mean it 's just ridiculous and all these things you know these these compile you know these are compiled start again these are compounding on our communities and the actual money that goes into our communities is less at least less so I think even if we put more money from the council it 's still probably is going to end up as less money actually on the ground in our communities so I think all of us you know especially us around the table here as governors need to think how can we do this differently that actually means money that we 're putting into these community organizations ends up on the ground because there 's no point giving more money and it just goes into another business that 's actually taking another chunk of the money for another compliance cost on it 's just unsustainable and ridiculous but again thank you very much everybody out there who 's done the work please pass on now thanks to your teams as well because it 's a collective a collective work and the money that is going out today will make a difference to our community so thank you clear yeah thank you wish to advance staff in colleagues obviously it 's a challenging situation and we can end up and effectively a bidding war and it can you know put you against colleagues but also against yourself so in my previous life I came from their ethos I 'm sorry sorry felt I 'm talking of you know caring for that the orphan and the refugee I 'm face today with do I choose between refugees or means welfare your fund which I can 't vote on christchurch community yes that 's a hell of a situation to be put in quite frankly i don 't want to get in that situation again so i just want to say look can we try and not so much just workshop the amounts but in similar value systems you know mine yours some summer some different but i think it 's got to be a way that we aren 't actually put in it and what i think are these invidious situations [Music] anyway yeah i mean this is it is a challenging process it 's a challenging set of decisions to make i think regardless of what process you ran to get to it would be challenging i always find these meetings difficult and challenging to to chair because of course you have got exactly the balancing act and exactly the conflicts which have been described so well by a number of people around this table this afternoon and it is very difficult to balance the effects of work done by so many different groups many of them volunteer groups across so many different sectors all of which I 've got good outcomes and it 's very difficult to balance one set of outcomes against another when you 're looking at you know quite different outcomes across different sectors and I think one of the things that comes out of this for me a large number of organizations in our community all of which is valuable and of course what we 've got to do in these meetings in a constrained funding environments is to decide which of those is more worthy of funding than the other or which of those is more valuable to our communities than the other and it 's a near-impossible set of decisions to make the funding review has been referred to and my hope is that that funding review will result in a more strategic approach to the way that we make funding decisions a more joined up process with other funders in the city and quite possibly a more joined up process around where government funding is both available and appropriate as well so that we get the best value from the amount of funding that we are putting into our communities I 'd also like to echo with the thanks to to staff I 'm aware of the huge amount of work that 's done before we get to the staff recommendations I 'm also very aware of and very appreciative of the work that unexpected proposals that come out in the workshop and and and meetings like this one and I 'd like to thank John Nicola and the people that are in the room and your colleagues for supporting us so well in the decision making that you know we 've we 've already alluded to has been quite difficult and without the support that you provide it would be even more difficult than we found it so thank you very much indeed for both the preparation and the reactive work that you 've undertaken as part of these meetings and in preparation for them we 've arrived at a set of recommendations that 's what we 're we 're going to be making a decision on in just a moment I think it 's fair to say through this process we 're never going to be able to keep everybody absolutely happy but you know certainly there has been some some good consideration and debate both through the workshop and through this meeting today and as has already been said the decision that we 're about to make is the result of that the funding that goes out to the community organisations that we are funding we 'll be well used and we 'll deliver good results there 's no question about that from the conversations that we 've had as we 've gone through the process Sara Dave okay so Dave and then Sara sentiments to this process of mine for a few years that we have successively over a number of years now reduced our level of strengthening communities funding and there 's the pressure on a number of their community groups has increased as a consequence I think the Chairman also alluded at a moment ago to being collaborative in our approach going forward when we are talking about a funding review of talking to our the other funders in the city but also I think you know we we need to look at the other prime source of funding in their City as the gaming industry and we as a council have the sinking lid policy so on the one hand we are reducing our own funding to the community on the next we are and the the city are finding increasing pressures on their funding so we need to think when we 're doing this funding review a very holistic approach across all sectors of funding in our community and there 's something I 'll certainly be advocating when there comes around thank you Sara thank you this has been a difficult at times fruit meeting there are so many fantastic organizations and occations they have hundreds of volunteers in tins and that tens of thousands of hours of work in our communities they meet all the criteria for funding contribute to the social and environmental well-being and vibrancy of our city and are all deserving of our support council processes mean that if we decline any of her funding they 're not able to apply to the community board and we have not made use of the other funding opportunities available to us which we specifically resolved funding to be available for and we chose this Jamie said earlier in this meeting if we could fund this we would and you know what we could have councils it 's Kendra 's mother 's have thanked staff had had to do and I do too but we are the ones who have made their job harder by not giving them the resources needed to fulfill the needs of our communities we went through this exact the same thing last year and you decided unanimously that increasing the level of funding available would be an excellent idea we resolved to 18 percent unanimously and yet a few months later we decided that supporting our community groups to build social capital resilience in cultural vibrancy wasn 't as important as for example providing grants to private heritage building owners councillor Galloway drew attention to the funding review and we stablished it at this very meeting this time last year it is this funding review that will bring the strategic and political leans that counselors cotta into not mentioned councillor Livingston found it hard to choose between refugee services the me is Welfare Fund and community house and we shouldn 't have to I did consider putting a new amendment to the meeting to increase our community funding the past experience has shown that while we are willing to carry motion all those in favor say aye aye against that 's carried thank you very much indeed and once again just echoing our thanks to the staff for all the work that you 've put into this and I 'll declare the meeting closed thank _"

    "text": "everyone I 'm just going to start today by reminding counselors to use their microphones there has been the odd occasion where the pearls of wisdom have not been recorded for posterity on the live streaming and so therefore if people I have apologies from Council of Livingston for temporary absence who will be representing the council at the funeral of Pete my son and Phil clear water as a apology for early departure and potentially so as Aaron Kieren depending on the time that the meeting takes but it 's a relatively short agenda I have a number of declarations of interest which will be recorded on the screen when we get to item 12 council controlled organizations just for those that are sitting on trusts and in board 's public forum there were no public forum presentations advised prior to the meeting no deputations by appointment no presentations of petitions and I will move to include the supplementary report in the in the meeting which is item Duty public excluded item 30 insurance renewal and I 'll move that seeking to by Andrew tuna I 'll put that no that 's carried and just before I move on to the capital wonderment fund education can I move all of the minutes and seconded by Andrew and I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed no that 's carry so that 's okay so now we move we 're just gonna deal with an item that 's that clean Livingston has an interest on the capital endowment fund application so we can deal with that before he leaves item 19 so Tony could I invite you to give a brief overview thank you which is should we partner with a healthy homes cannery service which I 'll talk what about what their services in a moment obviously if we pan up in that service we can then provide whole of home advice if we do not then it will be a sales focused advice that the residents will receive as part of that service and then the second question is of course how much would we contribute to that service should you should you choose to and there 's three options discussed in the a moment to talk about the difference between whole of home advice and sales focused advice because it 's hard to explain that in the report so I thought if I just give you a sense of what 's involved then you understand what we 're talking about in investing and potentially so for the residence it takes about one hour and the sister comes to your home oh sorry sales folks of our spheres to click on sales focus advice focuses on the features the benefits the product so a heat pump sales person for example we 'll talk about how the heat numbers the cost of the heat pump of course the size you need to be a home the benefits of having heat pump they 're efficient and to talk about the location of that heat pump and talk about the after sales service for the heat pumps it 's going to describe the benefits of their products and and the features that that product hairs and then you will be able to access a loan from the Regional Council to help fund their appliance but their to the homeowner which is totally fine and if you need a heat pump or installation fantastic but we 're talking about a different form of advice which is based on the building smarter service that the City Council is currently running which will eand when this new service starts and for the last war since the earthquake early 2013 we started the service we 've service that helped about five and a half thousand homes and make their homes warmer dry and healthier by giving them whole of home advice it 's free advice from an expert a trained professional they are qualified in a home performance assessment that 's the the of course they run us a three day course and they also sign a an agreement as to how they 'll behave so there 's there 's a high level of quality associated with the advice they provide it 's no obligation advice it 's in-home advice so the person comes to your home and walks around the home with you looks with a little fun aspects of your home and gives you that advice and then 's a written or list of things that your you can do to improve the home and it 's a prioritized list that talks about the benefits and the costs of making those interventions and it 's specific to the person into their home so it 's at least about the products and more about the dwelling and the person that 's how bill box Manor has run and this report proposes to continue that type of advice but to link it to some other financial support that 's available so the advice that we provide through box motor covers all of these different aspects and I just want to take a moment to give you a sense of the sorts of advice that they provide it 's one hundred and fifty dollars to provide this advice the assist is in your home our and then another hour to write up the advice and give you those recommendations so it 's two hours worth of work from an advisor Soph usually they assist the home then they give you that verbal advice and then they write you a written report some examples of the sorts of things they talk about they 've talked about draught stopping and draught stopping is the most important cost effective way to stop hit loss and for many homes in Christchurch the the drafts around the windows and doors amounts to about this and the size of hole in your wall so it 's basically the wind literally blowing straight through organ your doors in the windows making your home taller likewise because our windows are so poor talking about full length double layers of curtain us you can increase the room temperature by two degrees without adding any heat at all just by having improvements to your curtains so they 'll talk about how you can do that and the best ways to fit those curtains to your home they 'll talk about the sources of moisture in your home and where you get the moisture from and because Christchurch largely is built on a swamp we also get a huge amount of moisture on the ground which is about 45 litres a day coming into your home so they 'll talk about where that moisture goes because in the home that goes to wherever its coldest so cold places that moisture will condense like we said on our windows but it also condenses inside the walls the floor and even in cupboards and clothing that 's in the cupboards so thinking about where that moisture goes and then they 'll give advice on how to avoid that moisture in the home the importance of opening windows the importance of having a plastic vapor sheet on the ground a plastic round on the ground to stop the moisture rising out of the soil and the importance of having ventilation in the kitchen and bathroom to get that moisture out of the home and obviously not drying clothes inside having a flue gas heaters which produce carbon monoxide as well as moisture for the home they 'll cover all those aspects they 'll also talk about the importance of insulation and minding the gap brands have done research that shows that even a four millimeter gap which is tiny reduces the thin performance of your insulation by 15% so they 'll look at the condition the fit and the death importantly they 'll look at the damn lights at many homes here and see if they are actually drawing heat out of the room because the way that down lights work as they heat up and because they heat up the act like a chimney and they actually physically suck heat out of out of the room but also because they heat up the insulation needs to be set back from the lights so you have a gap a space around the lights so you 're breaking really the thermal performance of the insulation in your in your home so they 'll give advice around changing those to LED and I see rosy light switch thing can be covered with insulation that you won 't have the heat loss from your lounge the importance of like LEDs you can save twenty five dollars a light bulb if you change LEDs for example ripping hot water cylinders again eighty dollars place myself in one year so the importance of just keeping heat and in your home and making sure you 're not you 're just heating in this case ad salt eighty dollars years saved and even just switching off at the wall turning off appliances at the wall can save a hundred dollars a year and if you can if you having difficulty reaching around the back of your TV to turn off the switches you can also have remote controlled switches they actually allow you to switch off the lights remotely so that 's that 's a quick sample the some of the things I 've talked about in your home and then this is an example of a piece of a healthy home improvement plan and it lists the actions that are recommended the benefits of taking those actions it prioritizes them for your home and then it gives you an indication as to the cost for each of those things for your home so the person after the assessment has a hi little understanding about what they need to do for their home about the benefits of making those changes and then understanding the costs so healthier homes can agree on it 's a funding service it 's a available to all for 6,000 home owners ratepayers Connexus alone from the environment can be the reason council takes a nine year payback with a fixed interest rate and it 's only one home loan your Pierce and rent went on loan P right pass sorry so if you 're a landlord with multiple properties you 're just allowed one when alone but equally that one line has to apply to all of those things you might want to change so it applies to ceiling heating appliance kitchen bathroom fan moisture barrier and drafts topping now this is the first time that we 've ever had financial support for drafts topping and a moisture barrier and a fan in the home so this is a unique opportunity for everything abstractors this type of funding through bill backs smarter we we managed to achieve 75% of the homes that receive the advice took out their advice they they may change to their homes and the main reason why they didn 't was because of the financial constraints so this links an advice service to a funning service but there are other sources of funding also funding available from Iike that 's the government they 're now offering a 75% subsidy for insulation Trading banks ANZ have also offered a zero interest loan for insulation and we 're encouraging other trading banks to do the same and then there 's the curtain Bank of course from the community interjection which people can access to turns and then other product discounts so there 's a range there 's a suite of funding available for people to access but the key point is in order for people to access they need the confidence to be able to access that those funds so the sound advice and the financial support and deliver the highest level of uptake so that 's that that 's a quick run-through really on the background to this and why we put bringing this to today and I 'm happy to explore questions you may have but I understand there 's some questions around some finances and details which I 'm happy to reflect on there if it 's fun so if I could ask you to tune in reports to the first table with you what page is that on Tony yes it does yep so just what I 'd like to do is just walk through the table with you so you understand the sort of breakdown of the of the costs and we 're there rise so in this particular table we 're talking about 1,000 homes per year receiving advice at 150 dollars per home now that 's the total of 150 thousand of course we 're estimating that the next line down about three hundred people will take up the home line about three hundred but if they take the home loan you can fold into that loan one hundred and fifty dollar cost or if your self if the provider is selling a heat pump they may choose to waive that because the heat numbers are large item and they could probably give a discount from the provider because they 're dealing with a service at scale so maybe one of the suppliers would would offer that as an incentive so what we 've done is we 've assumed that all 300 will either roll the 150 into amounts to 45,000 and then that leaves one hundred thousand dollars hundred five thousand dollars remaining and then we have in our long-term plan allocated 20 thousand dollars per year and that 's indicated there and the next slide down is a 50,000 one-off carried forward so this financial year alone there 's a 50 and thousand dollar carry forward the next line is because there 's a gap between the financial year in to June and before the service starts and September we are still continuing with a bill gacks Madison and so the advice has still been given to the residents and so the cost of paying for that advice that 's happening between the two services there 's 20,000 and so then the bottom line is topping that up the capital endowment funds of the quiz along the bottom line 55 85 and 85 and that then means the total council contribution per year list of a long bottom so that 's where those costs and it 's kind of same for each of the of the tables in each of the options you know that 's I guess what you 're saying is is that with all of these different financial support options available to people if they were to get the right advice at the beginning that make some better choices about how they might access those during the smarter service provision we surveyed and every year to kind of understand how the service was being received and one of the one of the comments will correct me if I haven 't is that people appreciated that the advice was coming from an independent source another offer that this this provides this if the advice service was me I 'm Sarah thank you this does look really really good and I know topics matt has been really successful um two quick questions why would someone choose to roll 150 dollars into the loan when we 've already offered to pay it so we if with this particular proposal we 're talking about a thousand homes receiving the advice yeah and so that is made up of the cats or support and also the loan the rolling of their money into the loan circuit combination both Council 's loan which we think many people won 't yeah they 'll leave self funding the type that the improvements themselves they 'll be putting in the draft stopping with the installation or whatever might be on the road yeah hundred dinars was the cost of the advice yes sir so if we pay if we 've offered to pay for the cost of the advice why would a resident then choose to not accept the hundred and fifty dollars and to add that to the alone if you like yeah so at the moment the way the service is structured it 's it 's if you take up the loan with the Regional Council you lose math so it 's not a choice yeah it 's just a default ceiling of how these I can that allows us to provide advice to more homes it 's really good and the other thing is on her so four point nine councillors on page 168 it looks at the level of funding and different options no all options include a review of the service after three years in preparation for great what sort of data being collected to be really good to know how mean not just how many people but actually what advice they have taken I 'm not just the number of loans and things but the have really good data from the outset on actually the types of improvements the impacts of those that kind of thing because it would be really good data to have for a long term pen but thanks for very clear I 've stationed a house where the wind has been coming through the windows and it was in a house where a person was English as a second language so in terms of when the advisor goes into a to help that person is that advice did they stay with the person so that they can explain in talk and take them through so I think that would do really important yeah yeah the advisor comes to the home and in the example you 've given if someone who doesn 't speak English well or it might be that there 's an elderly person in the home we do encourage a person but the advisor is trained to be careful about how they treat a person and also even just walking around the home they don 't enter a room where there 's no where the owners not there for example so they 've got careful way they they manage the assessments but yes the Assessor stays in the home for that hour giving them the advice around all the different aspects of improving the home and then they receive later over support about the home any recommendations so if the person didn 't have access to the Internet for example and in terms of applying for the funding and all those sorts of things that would be also support was given through this so quite often people can just phone in and ask for the service to be delivered to them most because when we haven 't got a lot of money to spend on marketing nearly all of their bill backs murder uptake has been from word of mouth so people who have taken up the service and then they 're telling their friends and family members to use can ring up by phone as two main reasons ways to connect or can you choose to pay for it yourself the assessment yeah yes yeah yeah you could and I 'm sure that that we haven 't seen that up in the structure here but yes you could yeah because I mean it seems to me that I mean if they were some good publicity for this and maybe even today so the beginning of that you know someone like myself I could afford to pay so I 'm gonna ring up and say I 'd like to get the service but yeah that sounds like a great idea I mean some of the stuff I know because because I know other stuff I only picked up about drawing inside which I did all the time when I went to the Eco home opening you know the insulation opening that they did just recently yeah you know it just never occurred to me because you don 't see it happening yeah that 's so so damaging so now I 'm in cz didst open a window but never it um Yanni yep my understand I don 't pick up something that you said that previously the service was just endure peanut advice my understanding from previously because of lack of funding there were companies that were providing the advice they were also selling the products is it correct so the way the service is delivered so a mistake and in Christchurch we have three service providers who give that advice and one of them is Community Energy Action another ear con air con New Zealand Limited and then Smart Energy I saw em give me just mount a big event energy smart who 's associated with your LAN so those three companies have sent their staff to be independently trained through the Community Energy Network and then those those are their official home performance advisors and their signs some protocols around how they deliver that advice and those three companies didn 't have those staff going to homes giving that advice so it does sound like a heat pump or a sell an insulation company is coming to your home giving you information around their products but actually the those experts are described in a very brand neutral way and then the homeowner was left for the decision what would they like to to do it 's entirely up to the homeowner no obligation advice is what we 're providing and then the homeowner then is informed about the different financial supports that are available and then they can make their choice but they don 't know that the persons represent their everyday job they will know it so no there is but it 's not a product that 's that the live details about tricks as soon as we are paying for it built reveal box Martha is an advice service filing from that company okay yeah so in terms of any evaluation have we looked at how many people have been a serious and then what the uptake is in terms of products from which companies so in terms of the uptake we we 've got to do customer service and the customer survey results were that ninety percent was satisfied there 75% of the homeowners they received the advice actually took action in their home but what 's recommended to the homeowner that I haven 't grown specifics around what they take out no I understand that but just in terms of transparency if you 've got and you know I understand why you 've done off the way you 've done it but but I do think in terms of transparency that is actually quite clear it 's already raised this is a mechanism for collecting very rich data and obviously the what people take up you know linking it to the to the to the actual advice that they received yes who they receive it from wrong yeah there 's gonna be a significant part of the Ariat yep 70 10 the bully point of one in the two I just want to know what 's the relation there you pick up the 20 2013 homes rather in the fifty one thousand homes 32 percent because I review the 513 your particular emphasize fully insulated and 10 home is much harder and closely to 8 so the why you pick up the 22 percent only the those that are sweet 30,000 home yes father just giving and so that the piece of the report you 're referring to yes lists a whole lot of different challenges that we 're facing as a country in Christchurch yeah and I just in the other parts the report just referred to the one which is around insulation but you are right I mean moose Chur and dentists and the homes is a very significant issue for Christchurch which is listed here brains have done research just recently that 's come out with assessment for the whole of New Zealand saying that half of the homes in New Zealand have visible mold in them half so we really have a big problem with our moisture in New Zealand and this is an indication here so I didn 't want to in the in the analysis I wasn 't really digging into all of the different aspects that we could address but we are going to be addressing all of those aspects of insulation ventilation moisture management when we provide this advice in this household they have the Questor also would like to you know get a wise or the least 30 thousand homes so the voice service we could provide through this is looking only at a thousand homes a year so we do have guides they talk about the ways to warm up your house as well and will boom will revise these with the new branding of the new service there is also eco with the energy spot advertising on television to talk about the different ways to care for your home and then there 's tools that you can have on the website to about understanding the different aspects of your home and there 's little videos online that helped so there and we are also working through the health boards so talking about the medical centers in planket and those sorts of groups getting this information out there so that people understand the ways to make their homes healthier and more energy efficient okay second questions page 168 we tapped into the eruption wonder the figure you emphasized that over all three years is 335,000 yes well this figure comes from wide accumulate books by just two ninety five thousand dollars so the piece and there 's three tables one for each option yes and that details the the where those amounts add up to and what I 've just done and this piece of the brought you 're looking at there 's just summarized those akhiya to enter and for each option so the three 135 is a summary of the table that gives you more details ago with the funding and the all the money comes from thank you thank you um have we looked at including this in their own social housing at citrus so I understand that the City Council is embarking on an obviously of repair and rebuild process and that does include affecting a high standard of living for that for the dwellers have the helping trust at citrus side yes we have a massive amount of properties and yes the community rejection is being used to insulate those homes this is part of that yeah yeah so that program is underway and and but also in addition they 've also included life market standards in there too so that the dwellings are not just healthy in terms terms of the life stages of people and be good to know those numbers it 's hours that I meet your counselor session at record and all the other day and social housing tenant who obviously hasn 't been included in it at this stage but obviously for those people who need it yes so there was some work I 'm not sure the year sorry it was a few years ago there was some work done with the Community Energy Action where they work the DHB to invest insulation into homes that were where people really turned up to the doctors so they invested 1 million dollars into into homes and in that same year because of people not tuning up to the doctor and knowledge you needing a night in hospital they saved a million dollars a year as well so I think it 's about a thousand dollars a night before a patient in hospital so that person only needs to be in hospital for two nights and you 've paid for the installation of that home which is it 50 but what happened so if you the biggest benefit and that 's why in this report it talks about a 1 spend 6 return benefit because if you 've the elderly the young ill if they are the ones receiving this then the support that will dramatically reduce the health costs for people so we still all right so um Ben would you like to move maybe everyone more comments yeah yeah yeah but but I read illusion on the table yes so wouldn 't you which option are you removing the staff recommends I 'm right okay so move by gleam seconded by the key right glean all right thank you and thank you me for allowing this to be first on the agenda so I can attend that the funeral thank you Tony also for that the most compelling presentations I 've ever seen this is a good example of the joined up process with our Regional Council is you know it was signaled in the LTP for consideration through the rates neutral capital endowment fund the actual quantum per annum is much less than it used to be under the former build backs now we have a really sound reputation as a council for the previous scheme and it 's unfolding through back smarter the press wrote a very complimentary editorial at the time giving a big tick to the council for rolling this out you can see through the report and the presentation today that the advice if this wasn 't funded this advice wouldn 't happen rather people would be left with hit and miss advice from those who supply insulation they wouldn 't give that comprehensive overall advice what flies under the radar but you see it in the report is the 128 deaths a year we know about road deaths we don 't know so much about this but this is part of the reality and yet on the positive side of the equation the return benefit as Tony 's just said is six to one so I always had a hunch that warmer drier homes would lead to fewer deaths Elise illness greater product of and the workplace radio apps greater attendance at school but this actually you know provides a figure six to one I can hardly support for this it 's a great thing we can do the the actual quantum isn 't much it 's less than what I signaled to you in the LTP process and would be tremendous if you can support Thank You Lian and thank you a retro again said staff I think the work that has been done it 's been tremendous and this proposal was an excellent toe actually gleam loving son you reminds us about the importance of housing and warmth and shelter in terms of Maslow 's part hierarchy of needs and this has this fits this program classically to improve what actually clearly is early serious situation for our city in with 30,000 homes and critical need in our city that 's a huge number and so this program will go a long way toward supporting lien and that whole advice path is clearly crucial for people to understand what we 've been had that good fortunate today to have be given a good understanding of quite quite a difficult challenging problems from different perspective different ethos of your life different perspectives and is glean see terms of six to one it 's an it 's an excellent investment and I think having something up which actually for private householders to compliment requirements of landlords with new legislation this makes good seen so I guess the overall thing tone in for everybody 's health is it won 't lead to a reduction of fossil fuels that 's about there clearly clear in the report and that 's something that we would all want clearly at wintertime when electricity uses at its peak those times that the Huntley coal burning power stations are bought on and that 's what we were all want to attempt to so I certainly support support the staff recommendation and what Glen has said to and supporting and supporting me I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much thank you Tony Thank You Kelly the next one is the report from the regulatory performance committee draft dangerous in unsanitary buildings policy David well I 'll take it as read but it 's essentially we 're essentially person to otherwise take this reading very good are there any questions Sierra in the in the introduction to the policy itself it mentions 1.3 on page 54 very cheap that it also requires tab which are Jason which are buildings adjacent to a join or nearby a dangerous building or dam the dam isn 't really mention anyone 's within the policy I 'm just wondering with that part of the policy of fixes at all do we have any dams I just don 't see anywhere else and they when it comes to the effect of buildings that comes from the definition of affected building and no the Regional Council looks after dangerous teams the definition of affected buildings 13 was on page 59 of the agenda means a building there is a risk of damage or other impact from a dangerous building or deem that is adjacent to adjoining or nearby actually you haven 't pointed that out I 've just picked up that there 's a spelling mistake there it should be adjoining not a join and 3 yeah [Music] yep Yanni I was just running at a based on what we 've learned throughout earthquake experience in our former policy what changes we 've put in place and this policy competely old yeah one that we 've been very significant earthquakes and had you know but all the earthquake prone stuffs been taken out because that 's on the legislative framework now so but you know that so you 're talking about dangerous in unsanitary buildings yeah so and we 've got our legal representative at the end of the table so can you just be a little bit more specific about what you 're asking so at a high level obviously the affected buildings are something I guess is one key thing that 's been picked up any other things that we 've observed over the last you know 10 years for example or eight years that we 've fought in here or we haven 't put in here because we you know we can yeah we 've got maybe maybe that 's really not a question for our legal adviser so I 'm not really sure you know previously when we 've had this policy briefings where we developed it particularly post-earthquake we just developed it before that earthquake and September there was a lot of discussion around things like insurance now I know that this is not their own stuff but things like insurance makes you were a significant issue that was discussed last time because of the way in which we deal with things and what that means for property owners ok so there 's nothing in here that deals with insurance but the if a person has a dangerous or in territory building the council 's identified and there are insurance issues that is a matter that the staff dealing with the potential enforcement action would take into consideration in terms of the discretion about what for selection they might take are there insurance issues what is the level of dangerousness or in cemetery nature of the building you know em you know are there insurance issues that the business dealing one and just I mean I guess just the funnel and maybe it 's more of the chair the acting chair of that committee but you know to do something about concern for local people and you know it 's scale art factory and wolf stone as a class Oh covered in graffiti broken windows overgrown grass nothing seems to be being done is there anything in this policy or any other work that we 're doing as an organization that means that we can be more responsive given the significant increase in those types of buildings because of it as where yeah I think we talked about this this probably isn 't the place for that but the ECC touched on that I think I think was at yesterday 's meeting in the development forum is going to be looking at that and there are a range initiatives carrots and sticks around that and we have investigating exactly what you have just said the abide I don 't think this is the place for that come to the development forum on Monday though too because we will be discussing it if you 'd like I may regret saying it you notice because the development it 's the burnt out houses that sit there for three months we apply that comes because they sit there and no actions over who taken because of our policy um well is a seed announces the I think all the council 's got the email when I asked about the eyesore buildings so you know at a certain point in time and I saw building may well pass the threshold or there may be enough complaints and and evidence that makes it compelling that its offensive under the building it to become a nose building and then we can take some action but it is quite a high 3 shot yeah so um but I mean I 'm getting the sense that there needs to be another regulatory intervention there doesn 't the dangerous and unsanitary buildings weren 't but as another tease which has to go through a proper bylaw process which is separate from this yes well there 's also Resource Management Act and health it powers that I mean I think some of that stuff has been discussed with you in terms the various sites buildings issues yeah the different enforcement options that may be available for a ssin as you can hear from the community people are sick of it they 'd like to see their communities restored to some semblance of order if not it 's not never gonna be perfect but we can do better so but but I 'm getting the sense that it 's not this regulatory framework this is specifically required under the buildings act and it is something that we 're required to do is this form it and we really need to data show and deal with it separately yeah all right so Jamie would you mind move it David even though you weren 't there would you like to see conduct I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you thanks very much the next item on the agenda is the council controlled organization final statements of an intent swing through they really sorry finances performance committee roof yes this is just a noting paper and council reviewed the draft statements had feedback and then these just letting us know the final ones they 're on all the company 's websites and commentary on the major changes from the drafts to the final that 's it yep so you like to move it yeah kept sticking to by Andrew new discussion put the motion all those in favor say aye I suppose they no that 's carried thank you that all notice I 'm sorry I know I said before that they would only be rushing up on the board yes and they will be they will be all written up on board yeah so I 've got crush it so their holdings Chrysler Cinzia Holdings debase Civic building rod Donald banks punch I trust recommend Bush and Trust trans ways New Zealand local government funding agency and Christchurch Agency for energy trust with the relevant councillors who sit on the Trust 's or the board okay and corporate finance report for period ending 30 June right I 'm saying again I 'll take the report is ready there 's nothing really new in that you 'd like to move up to signify Andrew any discussion put the motion all those in favor say aye all those opposed say no that is measures this went through any committee Pauling 's just stepped out of the room Mike would you like to take over and introduce the item summit right speed limit so we reached me did the dice Pass Road so this is more of a continuation of that along the whole of the Summit Road so it 's around am having a hearings in appointing a hearings panel to look at those those roads that extend brand got me here through to Gibby 's Pass Road or the speeds and also the crime prevention right and your committee can set at this and depth yes all right so would you like to move it would someone like to second it so is there any are there any questions yeah Sarah thank you just confirm when the other roads on these pronunce it are going to be done and realized that this is one of the key roads the Metropolitan some rogue it 's overlooks the city crosses for community boards and then and to tell one but one of the key things happened from the previous summit road as she was Road at times would simply relocate boy races and others on to the Inner Harbor Road for example and those two roads in a Harbor Road in Summit rudder linked people do circuits similar people use them it 's sort of day-tripping from christchurch that kind of thing it committee been mentioned but though the alibiing peninsular roads were going to be consulted on for lowest speed limits as well my preference would have been to do that 's the the littleton heart in a harbor side at the same time the Summit Road but in the absence of that weiners that and a harbor stuff going to be done as well just as a quick background to this report this reports come here because that road across the top covers so many different community boards and what you 've got guys all the community boards to make advice when you make the decision actually on the speed limits so that 's why we 've brought that section the team will be able to answer the time because we are also looking at the speed limits around banks furniture as the big spatula speed limit review which is approximately 70 sites will be out for consultation in I say within three weeks the concern in particular with with FG bees pass was included along with the summit wrote is that Gibby 's pants fell all so ties in with the proposed changes at governor 's baton wrote and also Charteris Bay Road I think you 're answering my question the on when the hearings panel date can be seat but the intention is it would be towards the end of this year 2018 and then the Hearing Panel process would be as a mention of the report early 2019 there is a hearings panel proposed for Summit Road the other is a part a report to Council which goes to the community board first here concedes that one because I 'm just concerned the the overlap between Road in it in a handbag their concern with with trying to combine them is that they it delays the main body of the Beck 's burn chiller changes which we would like in place before the holiday season so we 'd like not intended to commence too early 2019 for Summit Road so the risk is we end up holding up the process for that and also there are a number of roads that come off Gibby 's past Road that we would like to change at the same time as part of the been special review so so we should hit the Inner Harbor the lowest state fingers crossed before that separating them you Satan very good so I 've got it moved and seconded so did I give a second if Phil Clearwater was alright yep I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much yes infrastructure transport and environment no sorry design state infrastructure design standard sorry that came also to a tee Pauline would you like to introduce apologies for missing it one that 's right um so okay so the purpose of the infrastructure design standards is to provide the design standards for votes council funded assets and assets that will be vested with the council are three processes such as a subdivision to the council note the approval of the steering group to the revised and infrastructure design standards at the steering group has delegated authority you 'll note that the or 120 submissions received anyone could submit on the design standards at any time during the year and the design standards are reviewed annually in the full documents are in a three-year review program currently these standards relate mainly to horizontal infrastructure standards that they 'll be determined later if the vertical infrastructure standards may be contained into in-depth into a single document together with horizontal looking at three point nine the main changes started assured us if there 's any major changes to any of these design standards in in a year they will come to the full council but these changes are mainly small one so the main changes are really typos and clarifications although if we look at three point one four that will be the interest because it relates to public and subdivisions so developers will now be required to show potential bus routes and bus stops and their plans and also noting 3.21 addressing the carbon footprint be carbon neutral by 2030 tips and the standards now and 3.22 which is addressing the zero waste by design so the tweaking of these standards are intended to deliver safer services and improved well-being to everyone involved that 's contractors staff citizens and the environment so this has been supported by the committee and you 'd like to move it in the seconder Aaron right Tim thank you another note in 3.1 for the the subdivisions required to just outline or make sure there 's going to be room for public or for buses etc public transport and their subdivisions so is there any requirement for them their future planning and I 'm thinking of the Southwest with regards to Park and Ride stations because if we are looking at the ongoing pressures on Lincoln Road and the ongoing discussions of four-lane and debt and the detrimental defector could have in the Eddington village one of the things that could so that future planning would be there the ability to put a pack and ride somewhere and that halls will Leary for those people in Lincoln pre-built in Ralston but drive into that area and then baths or public transport into the city so is there any requirement or any vision for that I think from the park-and-ride point of view on we 've talked about transport network it 's a big piece of infrastructure that we would probably have to pay rather than being part of a subdivision because it would serve more than just that subdivision that would be serving a whole area and so we 're certainly and we assume Lee having discussions around you know what is so the park-and-ride but I think it would come up as we would have to purchase land and we have to go through a resource consenting so it 's actually beyond it 's a bit like building a bus interchange you know some of those big chunks of infrastructure beyond this this is more for used to be called sub-divisional standards it 's expanded out from that but it 's about the standards we want people to build infrastructure to that will transfer into our ownership so I think Park Ride generally is a bit bigger than what the carbon footprint oh yeah there could be a future save you know like a silver stream in Wyoming clear we 're there next to the little commercial area they 've got a POC and right there so it would be similar type of things so depending on the size of the subdivisions and activities that they 're taking so there probably is as David indicated would be a balance between what we might provide a bit substantial versus a smaller point I guess it 's along the lines of Town Planning in the sense that if you have a park and ride close to a key activity area like halls or shopping scene it 's something that adds value to that community into those being you 've got supermarkets etc so rather than going continually so the the malls you can actually and get its strength to those communities through economic benefit for those so I guess it 's about future planning and like with those subdivisions going around it it 's where do you put it so there must be some vision at some stage about because it if it is all given to subdivisions no one 's going to give it up and it also becomes more expensive Council to purchase if there are subdivisions and I 'm just thinking future planning we 're talking about it all the time and we get caught in that ties into the district plan as opposed to into these infrastructure design teams so that would come through a resource consent process now if there were enough of them coming through we would then get some standard design that we could put in here however I think that planning that structure you did right but that is a planning issue rather than a infrastructure or design standard issue but if you something had that condition in it we would then start putting in this is our standard design as it is for a bus stop a particular scene okay thank you Yanni I 'm really concerned the what appears to be just a proliferation of traffic signals to our city some intersections it 's really hard to kind of understand the design you know there 's traffic lights that get put arrows all the way of sorry right hand turning arrows on the left further it 's the corner which doesn 't seem to make much sense if you 're in that lane you can 't you get can 't actually turned right because you 've got three lanes of traffic are we able to I don 't know how much consideration being given on them through here around the traffic light designs are we able to get like a workshop at least some around what the kind of current thinking is about why we 're seeing such a proliferation and the number of signals arrows versus you know I guess what was previously there and how our design thinking is going if I could briefly comment on that one so again it 's a lifting of the ball within our design space and that 's what the design standard is is that we continue on an annual basis lifting the bar and went off chatted to the see guys what the indications are is that often a single traffic entity going in has obviously a domino effect up and down Manchester Street and so the idea is that over a period of time we modify them so we both modifier operation of our signals and obviously the design of our signals so you 're right Ronnie from that point of view that we continuously lift our bar on this process we 've got we can bring a briefing with the traffic engineers and see top to the either the itty committee or to Council regarding traffic and traffic lights one of the issues you 'll find around particularly right turning arrows is because the rule used to be giving way to lift turning vehicles right had to the right of way we have had a number of traffic lights that have we do lack probably right turning arrows but we are looking at doing that and part of this road safety provision of that but certainly we can bring a briefing if you look at the infrastructure standard say talk about if you have to put traffic lights and they become a bespoke design that we specifically approved so there 's no set of rules in there but there are would be Augustine horse will Road there 's been a new set of traffic lights that we known as part of that subdivision but then they were bespoke we designed and they had to get signed off by NZTA in that case because it was a highway saying with the ones that on the oldest we own a small focused on high street charm street and that 's not the infrastructure we totally so like we 've got loans that go straight ahead you 're putting in traffic lights with right turning arrows where the lane can actually turn and so and I know we want to improve but it doesn 't seem to be some of it seems very illogical and maybe there 's reasons behind that but I do think having some understanding of why we 're seeing such a huge proliferation just even up on Durham Street there 's about you know yeah because I 've been I 've been generous because I agree with you but this isn 't the infrastructure design standards as what we 're dealing with today not the actual decisions to locate deal with that because you know I understand this paper so we 'll just lip pack it we 'll find a mechanism to deal with it but we won 't be dealing with it today so okay and then just the other question was so it 's great about the bus routes going new through new subdivisions are we also requiring let 's cycle ways because that 's been one of the concerns that people have raised previously that footpaths in cycle ways are not clear through subdivision outline development plan and therefore we get a lot of debate I think you know there 's a classic the noble subdivision where that kind of came up so yeah so you 're right you 're on your from the point of view of active transport we need to make sure that people feel safe on any road as far as cycling and walking because sectors concerned so at the moment we will require walking on collector roads and above as far as cycleways are concerned and that 's required from a point of view of when someone actually does a subdivision line markings we prefer that they actually go down at the time of subdivision in the past sometimes they haven 't always but the ideas again it 's a process that we can improve exactly like with the bus routes as well and we can actually make sure they 've all of those areas the standards are lifted over time we have got off off road cycle loans going through some of the reserves and some of the pathways so we are doing them I 'm actually seeing what the actual under budget what the standards actually ask for that but we do look at a proving as we approve we need to approve the final engineering designs under the standard so we get the opportunity to if we can I 'm just thinking I just would hope that these actually have a really strong requirement for off-road cycle lanes link connections to emcee ours through the subdivision and design standards so that we actually it 's the best time to get off road cycle rain certain and I 'm not I mean maybe I missed it but some developments we have to link those together so it 's something that we 'll go and have a look at sort of see what we 've got in here and we intellect into the next version very good it 's not just offroad that have been preferable but they can 't_''_4655.61 be good all right mmm excuse me I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much Sierra 's sick and do that syrup you 're a substitute over here for a workshop on traffic light very good okay options for upgrading main pumps water supply pump station morning do you want to do a brief overview that would be fantastic thank you this report follows the overview of the water supply program it was reported up to you 9th warmest and focuses particularly on main pumps now main pumps down in Beckenham there 's a critical water supply pump station across the city it supplies that live a percent of our central zone and five percent of the water for the city as a whole we have six one so then as our shallowest aquifer the source water there has previously been considered secure but recent sampling and testing has cast some doubt on this we won 't be able to confirm the status of that water until we 've done further modelling of the aquifer and there 's some 10 to 12 months away so there are six wells and all six wells have below ground wellheads which are not considered to be secure so at the moment either gotcha coronation at that pump station and we are proposing ultraviolet disinfection as an alternative when you say not considered to be secure can I just kind of say not considered to be secure by the engineers who are required to sign them off for meeting drinking water standards compliance that 's creeps those wells have been we 've waited out of that is secure in the past they 'd read the is likely to be a permanent installation even if we do ultimately raise it 's for for other reasons the alternative to installing ultraviolet at this stage is to simply put this pump station and the or building a new pump station elsewhere so those alternatives are excellent all right so okay questions so Yanni Phil I 'm thinking thank you for the report oh I was just trying to understand so in terms of history for Christchurch and what UV treatment actually addresses say I think I 've had the response back around protozoa that we 've had no recorded instance of protozoa and you be as an effective treatment for that UV is treatment against bacterial viruses enterprise right so that 's what I wanted to ask so for the non protozoa bacteria and viruses how many times have we detected those in our water supply I think there 's been one detection it main pumps in one will over what time looking back over the last five years right which is this relevant period to consider so in terms of value for money we 're effectively spending a lot of money on something that 's happened once in the last five years we are required if the if the either the source water or the well heads are not regarded as secure we comply with the drill New Zealand drinking water standards so there is a requirement regardless of the third criterion which is what you 're talking about it 's the detection of e.coli on the water so there are three criteria that we have to satisfy all three the source water the wellhead security of the world hits and then the Epis monitoring of the polarizer the absence bacteria if you look at the drinking water standard say they are based on a risk basis and this certainly drops the risk quite significantly it 's another barrier basically to anything happening so gives a surety but it also has the added advantage that it doesn 't add anything to the water the water comes in the sayings that goes out it 's got all the any potential bug kill so just in regards to and I think I emailed through the beaker report so the report that came out from government made reference to they 'd been a I think that was like an over-reliance on using UV to treat water which was expensive and for risks that were pretty low feedback around that kind of comment in terms of the value for money in terms of what we 're doing here this is putting this money back into actually bringing the well heads to a secure status by raising them my understanding of the comment and the beaker report was around ultraviolet disinfection being put in place just for protozoa we 're not doing that here we 're doing ultraviolent for bacteria viruses and protozoa so in the bigger report what they were talking about was supplies that were filtering possibly fluctuated flocculating in filtering the water then using UV and then using coronation treatment as a residual in the in the reticulation as well so they were using UV as a filter embraces approach to preserve and that 's a relatively expensive approach if you hit my prozac and just I mean just the far question if we agree to do this we 're still looking at a time frame of the implementation and then the monitoring which would be what about 18 months before we could even get these to be secure already started so we 're running treatment urn I thought there was a time frame where we had to monitor no we do the protozoa monitoring we started the protozoa monitoring ready so we we will know whether or not there are any protists over to teach it in the wheels so so just between now and when the UV treatment gets put on what what time frame are we looking at from today if we agree to do us to getting these signs off as being secure I would expect the drinking water Assessor to sign them off as secure once we have the plant commissioned and operating we 're proposing June although we will look at bringing it forward if we can so thanks Helen for that explanation to in especially around it being a shut the shallowest aquifer in the city just from what you 've just seen tone was my question was was really red when was similar to Yanni 's so basically although although in fact the monitoring is already started in in terms of but once the UV are certain there 's a good chance that the water authorities the standards once the UV isn 't here yes and so there won 't be need any long follow-up testing period required well we don 't usually test for protozoa so this is this is additional testing yeah so we test for e.coli regularly successful when we consider two extension to some other the water supply the pump station or not yes we are considering using ultraviolet at other pump stations and we 're looking at we have a number of criteria for considering whether or not we 'll put an ultraviolet one is whether or not they 're drawing on the shallowest aquifer on April 1 where we may need to add another disinfection barrier the second one if the pump station is regularly used because the ultraviolet light the lamps don 't like being turned off and on so if the if the pump station is being regularly used and then the third one if we 've got space to do it so that we can put the plant in place so we are running a ruler across the city at the moment looking at looking at those options for the one to two weeks they already down or not yet you need to shut down close we need to shut down the pump station to install it is already that no or not yet no--yeah part is your brain you know because this water supply for 11% for the city why we can cover that there 's no problem at all especially if we shut it down and a low demand period through the winter okay that 's the question option to remedial Oswell hate these 1.8 million dollars this for all city while all still just part of the well hated for those it 's for all six wheels it main pumps that remediation all six wheels it main pumps ease okay thank you just a correction on there it 's a living percent of the zone it 's five percy by the city so fool did you have a question i wrote your name down yeah master i was fun and we honey it out some of the greek night wasn 't it alright that 's good sorry the you mean you leave a receipt live same gym so there 's only one hundred ninety five thousand people right there trying to do the sums it 's about twenty thousand three thousand seems to me here the main driver here is the concern about the aquifer one water status can you just talk a little bit more about that compared to some of the other actresses owns around the city and what the council 's current position has been with respect to the quality of different quality of dinner yes so equal for one is the aquifer that is the surest aquifer so in the in the west of the city there is seem you can find or unconfined down to equal four one in the east of the city it 's reasonably well confined down to aquifer one and it for one has performed very well for us and in it main pumps that provides a lot of water all the previous sampling and age testing for ever for one at main pumps has deemed that water to be sufficiently old to be regarded as secure but the more recent testing particularly if the water 's certain of the secure status of equi for one at this site so it does depend on where you are in the city in terms of what kept before you 're tapping into the lower aquifers so two three four and five all regarded as secure and the edge testing confirms that for one testing that we do those things on edge and some of it 's shown that it 's still 150 years old water we also look at what is the percentage of water that 's under one year old and then drinking water standard talks about point two zero zero five and hope I 've got the nitrite percent I think I 've got the right number of zeros only so very very little and they do comply with that but as Helen says there 's been a change in chemistry some of actually has got older since we tested we did a real rigorous testing in 2005 some of us got older for some reason and so assume there 's enough variability that there actually we looking at some of the data and the detail fine at before one absolutely secure it aligns with the previous results is no change whatever and maybe some of this has happened because of changes in the earthquake you know you may have had a purpose it of slightly shifted who knows and so they 're doing a bit more work on that so ten months so in terms of taking the approach that we are taking around the city of raising the well heads you 're suggesting you be because you think there 's a potential that we don 't know yet downgrading of that and you 'll say that we shouldn 't it doesn 't make sense to wait once we have those results otherwise would have to raise the well here well we we probably will probably raise the world kids anyway ultimately but they 'll go to the back of the cube in terms of that because for health and safety reasons and ease of maintenance and all sorts of other things we will we will raise them and bring them up to this practice but but we can defer that in probably three or disinfection and is that as there 's an alternative to chlorination so we can take chlorination out of their power station ID on them David I 'm just clarifying with the so you 're saying that putting a UV system and now will get us secure status for those wells but up in four years time we ultimately raise the well is does that movie then become well it depends on the results of the groundwater modeling and what happens with it before one if it 's not regarded as secure even if the well heads are secure we will still need some sort of disinfection so we have to meet all three criteria the source water the security of the world hits in the absence of all I would say also the drinking water is based on multiple barriers so it is another barrier that in case something goes wrong the holes in the cheese basically if you 've got all these barriers something change happens we probably would use that infrastructure and until it at least ran out of its useful life so you know I think we barrier the good assurance it 's getting a anticipable to an absolute this is the trouble I mean it seems to me that people forget what risk is you know that you know because what we 're talking about here is a you know that the chances of a happening is a rare but the consequences of it happening are severe so you can never and I think sometimes people conflate the two issues and talk about risk when they 're really talking about likelihood so and it 's probably a bigger conversation things for today deal yeah well I will ask what I was trying to thinking about for the the wells that we 've gotten the aquifers the City Council or the city is the only one that draws from the deep Equus vs. they write what they dreamed with picket but so do any others have them from the deep well make all the difference they do but there 's a lot more that will be drawing it from the shallow aquifer echo for one I 'd have to check with Environment Canterbury what what the distribution the D papers as well well I put the origin we are the we are the biggest user of the system yeah so I 'm for that shallow aquifers anyway as they much more for the people that are using the other or drawing water from the aquifer and they don 't have proper back flow meters is that a risk to us as well so they are required to have backflow measures and those are audited as well and the the one of the joys of Christ system is that most of its artesian so the water is being forced up in the if you like it 's almost a natural backflow prevention mechanism alright yes proof yeah just sort of a follow-up actually I mean how many pumps do we have drawing water from Accra for one we have 17 wells in it for one from memory I 'm looking at jamun cuz you can remember the exact number but it 's appropriate proximately 17 and Vic for one sorry how many pumped stations I just come back with you on that sorry just to give you an foothills of the portals because there 's no deeper aquifers at that point in time that 's why that 's slightly different to the apple for ones that we decided that we 'd do away with in the northwest because we had alternatives of deeper aquifers but because of the port hills and the way the rocks come down there is only aquifer one so if we decided to abandon main pump station for example we would need to relocate it somewhere else because there 's no alternative my understanding that main pumps to go down to 2 April 4 2 3 4 because it doesn 't exist in the geology at that point yes so my question was other pump stations how are we treating those those other stations in terms of are we raising wellhead what 's the status of those so it 's a mix so at the moment those are being have chlorinated and most of them we 're raising the world hits but when we do the edge teasing of it before 1 it 's not it 's not it before 1 in any one the city so in the West we know it 's not secure and that there are surface and influences and we 've deepened all those wells in the East many of those wells may well comply so it depends on on the edge testing and the water chemistry testing as to how much risk there is that they won 't comply in the future so we 're looking at that distributive paper that was based on the 205 results which shows you the line where a prefer 1 is considered at that point secured and unsecured and I have circulated I think I thought I 'd circulated all the counselors but I can certainly circulate that map that gives you that line that shows where aquifer 1 is considered based on the 205 and so I 've got to put that proviso on his and all the pump stations that we 've got an apple for one at that time we 're secure apart from the northwest ones which you 've already addressed it was known in 2005 we were doing 205 those were the last time we did a water decision and we didn 't need to well we shouldn 't do it until the geology had settled down after the earthquake and that 's why I was doing that you know I understand that but are you saying that the that that the Northwest shallow bores were identified in 2005 because I mean there were brought to our attention until the 05 at that time they were showing no transmissions on on eco lies and whatever so no that wasn 't there was no issues raised with those words I 'm not talking about the transgressions I 'm talking about um requirement number one which is the age of the water the the security of the would have to go back and have a look at those results it was I hope you see that the 2005 report showed that it moved across the city sign showing of the okay physical line so it 's a physical line which shows where the confining layers begin wait for one and the East right so that 's not necessarily exactly the same thing as age testing and security but is a bit yes that 's true yeah that is true and that program being signed off by the drinking water system but yes it was an acceleration program it may insist I 've got a short list of other stations that we 're looking at ultraviolet before so this is a preliminary shortlist it will change so some will come off and others will go on but they include spreadin maize redwood belfast in Thornton all right Jonnie I wanted to pick up on in the report that we 've got attached it says under 9 to some page 163 there 's opportunity under the current health app to be deemed to be to comply fully with DWS NZ without necessarily meeting its technical requirements this requires the water safety plan is approved by the local drinking water Assessor then it goes on to touch on that we could agree to a different approach so can you give us some sense of what conversations have been had with the drinking water Assessor and where things are at in terms of our water safety plan it 's 6 page 163 9 'm really just trying to understand the drinking water Assessor you know in terms of weird are at in terms of a level of comfort because it seems to me apparent that when we want to remove chlorine from our water we 're not gonna have secure status signed off by the engineers for all about welfare look don 't don 't don 't end a project before we 've even got to the sort of final consideration of it the the pointers is that if we can get enough water into the system that isn 't chlorinated and came mayn 't paying that through the summer we can turn off the chlorine so that 's what we 're focused on we 're focused on up 100% everyone 's giving me a rule and I don 't think that it 's necessary to to focus on you know okay I was just trying to understand given the level of expenditure and given you 've said that I think these would go to the back of the queue to be raised to be secured for best practice and that might be possibly spending two million dollars for you know it 's another multiple barrier which is a good thing so it 's not wasted work at all think of the Swiss cheese analogy so the more barriers for you know possibly exit and I don 't think that 's a point of order that 's a point of debate but you know the biggest just not people arguing with each other around the table I can manage the meeting and myself sorry so I can answer the question about the drinking water assessor so we have a regular monthly meeting with the drinking water Assessor which is about an overview of the program and raising any issues that that either we or or the drinking water assess ahead with the program in any questions and we also have regular technical meetings on individual pump stations and individual proposals to ensure that the drinking water Assessor understands what the proposal is and as an agreement with with what airplanes are in terms of compliance with drinking water standards and in the report that we 've got it says that we could go and we grieve our water safety are signed off by the drinking water Assessor we 've got one and a few anyway the potential for his of the substances at that site I don 't know what it 's just in the summary where it kind of indicates that we wouldn 't need to make all the technical requirements of the drinking water standards AJ we may not have to put you there and if we agreed the water safety plan with the drinking water Assessor I 'm just trying to understand the likelihood of that what if there 's a process underway to kind of present to the drinking water sister here 's our water safety plan and the water safety plan has already signed off it 's one of the many differences as Helen pointed out a new laurs report that between us and Havelock North sorry but they didn 't have a signed off water safety plan we just I 'm just trying to understand so if we 've got a drinking water he 's taken one time and the report that is attached to support the support the alternative dissin fiction 's it 's not to do with sorry it 's a more general statement about an approach so there 's no chance that the drinking water Assessor could agree to a water safety plan that didn 't include UV yes it would be clora to use ozone treatment or some other treatment but what we what we 're proposing is the preferred option is ultraviolet so we have to have some sort of disinfection and at this pump station but if you 're so enamored of the report Jonnie the next sentences although there is opportunity to agree a different approach with the dwn encapsulate the Sanna water safety plan there is a risk associated with us as the gwas approval could be withdrawn at any time this could result in any alternative solution suddenly becoming non-compliant as they would require upgrades or extensions to comply based on our assessment we do not believe that there are any additional treatment options that should be explored through there at present as these will either not demonstrate compliance or will be very expensive and slow to implement UV disinfection so I mean I I don 't know how clearer it could be and there are others out there that he hasn 't assist but they are not systems that approved if you like under the guidelines that are available and there an ounce of all in their own page silver halide ulation and directs and filtration filtration and bag filtration what I don 't so I get that I get I totally understand you know that the UV in terms of all the assessment that 's gray approach to me all the technical requirements what I don 't get and the first time that I 've heard is that we don 't need to make all the technical requirements if we can get a water safety plan agreed with the drinking water assessor I think what it 's saying is that you could come up with something completely novel a completely novel water treatment that is not anticipated by the drinking water standards and is not covered by any of the prison guidelines you could document that in your water safety plan you could demonstrate then it the drinking water assessor it is possible and she could with every time there 's a very difficult and long approach but it is a possible approach so yes we could explore other alternatives so all right so and you have another question you 'd like to move it then second it by I move my aim and seconded by Pauline is there any discussion Phil I think this discussion has been really valuable because clearly the questions raised in with really clear answers that ISM what I think the most complex issue that weird council dealing with and I do think the start for the clarity of the report and especially because you know we 've always known I guess that the aquifer one the ship the shallowest aquifer has potentially had some issues and I think it 's good that we are being updated with the recent water research and I think the the report points to some real gains by using a UV system at around these pumps because in there the UV system treats both the bacteria and protozoa we know there 's no silver bullet berry approach will really assist us to get our water standards compliant you know I think this is so important because I think LeAnn alluded to what happened at Hadlock north and the consequences if we don 't make sure or the security of air water and you know we so we cannot be complacent we cannot wait to get every sort of answer we need to build on the different the different interventions that are being made so you know I think it 's it 's clear though that in fact at a general level we as a council have already said to staff look we do want you to progress and look at the delivery of these alternative systems and works so that we can improve the well hits and it included installing ultraviolent so i 'm very happy to support the recommendations today you the spikes see how Simon mout are often talks of no plan B and I think there 's one thing I disagree with them on because I always want to have a plan B and I think when it comes to our drinking clean pure safe and secure water in Christchurch but we need to ensure that once it 's gone it remains gone I think the UV treatment technology not only moves us closer to that goal in the short term and ensuring that our water will be chlorine free for more people but if there 's ever a will or a push for widespread chlorination be that likely or unlikely in the future we 'll be in a far better position to be able to push back from there as we have a genuine alternative to chemical treatment I think this is a pragmatic move that will hold us in good stead it 's one in the short-term it 's a one in the long term and I see it as a really pragmatic approach to mitigate against the so-called holes of the Swiss cheese aligning in future so very supportive thank you to make a drinking water standard is very crucial we are all aware but it 's kinda two different way one is a weak ordinary wood but we are all aware the people particular concern coordination especially recently water for the hot water the sitting you know they have a cost karashi estate so quite a few even add myself a who that carefully in my my area especially the older community the otherwise new in innovation this UV the kind of is a new innovation technology you with a treatment even a moment is in the taste testing stage but we 're a poof were not Candida kind of dealing with nose protozoa and also to dealing with the bacteria etc at least there 's no any most of a combination of what can be easy so you can compare these two and also you read particular review the option one and option two but option one is those is UV treatment and we can you know the to 11% for the water supply and also know the the coordination of water we can go ahead the option to particular tees are one teaching here their particular mainship consider timing because why the if you know the quant of water modeling during early 2019 sure that a prefer one is not the secure then this view with for another six months for six months a citrus odor I think a popular you know this good the mystic the option happy wife so I support a few went to okay thank you you know I 'm just very quickly because I know that we will this but look I really want to congratulate Helen and entertain me for for exploring these some fiscally prudent options and for making these recommendations today we know how complex of Situationists we see different options for different pump stations at different aquifers with different well here 's we 've got a short-term in long-term program of work and our eyes firmly on that goal of removing this chlorine as per as possible and I think we 're hitting down there creating well so you know it 's amazing work that you 're doing your reports are incredibly clear although they 're complex so that 's here thank you pointed myself in the position of having something longer that I 'm going to cut completely because Jamie said it all so just quickly to summarize getting this started now it gets the chlorine as a key part of our arsenal should we need to battle for an exemption well I 'm just gonna I 'm just going to say one thing quickly as well and I just want to remind people all the time when we consider this matter that there are very explicit differences between Christchurch and Havelock north and there has been in my view a very strong reaction and I would say overreaction to what 's happened and Havelock North it is a reminder of the severity of the consequences and we do support that the underlying thesis which is our obligation to supply safe water so we absolutely support the minister when the minister says we want demonstrable safe water but the idea of residual disinfection as a as a mechanism when we know from reading the reports Havelock North reports the chlorination is not a an absolute barrier and in some instances you could say that it breeds complacency and if there 's one thing that you could never accuse the Kruschev City Council of and regard to its water as complacency we know we have a valuable a wake-up call of incredible proportions it is a reminder to people how precious our water suppliers and is really a call to action that goes beyond this table and I was at a meeting the other night and that was very much the message that was received that we 're in this together and we can protect our water supply if we are to keep to you know the winter levels and we 'll get things done more quickly but I just want to remind people that in the Christchurch Havelock North contest they did not learn lessons from the previous outbreak we have consistently looked at the approach that well head or the read ruling and the Northwest that began in 2012 that was before Havelock north and we fast-tracked it as soon as the Hemlock North incident happened in order to create a safer environment as quickly as we could their aquifer was not confined we 've already heard a really good explanation of our aquifer system they had a high transgression history we don 't we don 't have the transgression history that they have and was demonstrably a contributing factor for the situation that they were confronted with and that is not the case here and they didn 't have a water safety plan Safet signed off which we do so you know I think that again I 'd like to just repeat what Pauline said and congratulate the team you 're doing a fantastic job and keep going basically repeating a lot of what 's been said but it 's clear that permanent installation of ultraviolet treatment system at Maine pumps water supply pump station is an obvious solution ultraviolet disinfection is an effective alternative to chlorination for the sheesh water supply ultraviolet disinfection is technically feasible can be implemented in a timely efficient and cost-effective design pumps and most importantly once the UV system has been installed in commissioned chlorination can cease at one of the city 's largest pump stations there is strong evidence that UV treatment delivers safe drinking water the new the Netherlands approach to treating water proves that the multi barrier barrier approach which includes UV is successful they don 't use chlorine at all and and unlike the to five times the rate of waterborne disease than the Netherlands so our initial challenge was to protect a vulnerable residents as we face the risk that our water supply might not be safe we responded quickly and effectively with temporary chlorination and as we face these another challenge that we face the possibility of central government requiring and requiring us to chlorinate and we have this opportunity now to prove that we are more than capable of managing our own fears when it comes to delivering safe drinking water without chemicals here is just another opportunity for christchurch to lead the way in innovation in sustainability so totally supporting staff recommendation here today thank you I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much now we 've got two more items on the agenda for this part of the meeting so I 'm going to propose we just take ten minutes some people get a coffee and we 'll start back at 30 thank you you all right thank you very much the next item on it to your to his road approval of the final section 71 proposal under the greater christchurch regeneration act and this went to no committee so it 's just coming straight here so the key would like to move us and Aaron would like to second it okay Aaron 's moved the key seconded it and it 's now open for questions is there any discussion yep three talks about the impact on the existing and planned I 'm just curious because obviously the full beep All Hazards was being delayed I just wonder why we would stop private company actually looking at creating Aquatic Center that will actually take kept casual recreation and actually reduce the impact on council really based on the spaces and places assessment which is a plan by sportsmen even who have outlined what facilities we need earthquake and and including the areas which have being developed and more populated and the conclusion was that we have more than enough aquatic facilities in Christchurch to meet our needs in the short and medium term another aquatic facility would be required in about to 20 years on our own facilities in terms of taking clients away and making them unsustainable but at the moment we haven 't actually built the home before that 's actually been pushed back even further so 10 people you could say actually we may not need that when we pull because we 've got obviously Boston 's got a very large just around the corner and Yahoo 's takes into account who me as a proposed ban meaning the council has committed to it in in terms of long-term plan and finances so that is taken as a facility that is going to happen we don 't want to I think stop private actually provided facilities for Christchurch residents just so we can build they 're not right than this no yes but also we we don 't want to create a conflict between our facilities and theirs and the idea is that we 're not trying to stop them from having an aquatic facility what we are saying is that you initially were indicating to us that you really want to the facility to for athletes to train and compete know living the general public in and swim learn to swim lessons then all of a sudden the adjoining facilities that we run might be running into yeah I totally agree what we currently run I guess it 's just more of a question that 's how we gonna do it then we could say hang on we don 't need to build yeah yeah thank you for sharing um Jonnie I mean I was kind of struck by that as well give him that we don 't place that same restriction on a number of private suing providers that have opened up in this area we don 't provide it on on malls when they expand and having gems for example so why would we do it for this one and we haven 't done it for others private facilities that we have currently in Christchurch obviously we 're filling a need that one as the the spaces in places plan indicates is not really going to fill an identified need or fulfill a need its its surplus at the moment in another 10-15 years it may well be that facility necessary to meet the demand of a particular area or particular a generational group at the moment that potentially could that could spell facilities if it was I understand the concern around it competing with our own facilities but what I can 't see is the consistency with the logic that we 've enabled all these other gems to open up in the city next to our facilities we 've allowed shopping malls to expand that include gyms within them we 've allowed and I don 't know what consenting that goes through but there 's been a whole bunch of new private providers in terms of swimming lessons for example in some areas of the city so I just don 't quite understand why we would place one restriction on this and not had that same restriction on the others and how that 's actually fear to the public who obviously would want to make a choice about where they might choose to go if you lived like in your curst you might want to go to the pool that 's closest to you rather than travel same reasons really all the private facilities that you 're talking about that providing a swimming lessons or just general recreation have been taken into account in this patient place plan so they they obviously existed before the plan was drafted and it 's very recent it was finalized at the beginning of this year so it takes into account what is actually on the ground and what is being planned or proposed planned meaning it you know whether it 's us or other private bodies are committed to it financially or planned like your host that 's still in the planning stages so in that context that particular product facilities service and we 're not saying that it 's going to be surplus forever it may well fulfill the need that arises in the ten years I 'll process question if we 're not happy with that Bingham there are we able to move an amendment that it gets removed and if so what 's the time to do that well we wouldn 't be able to get it to remove it if it 's built we we can any further restrictions at the moment at what the rules are proposing to do is to restrict the use of the facility to sports training and competition so we 're not saying it cannot be built we 're saying it should be useful we 've been through a process of discussing this with CSL and Chicanos and other interested parties and they 've agreed and are happy with what we have here I just wonder I just wonder whether staff wanted to provide some commentary on and the need for the plane to be aligned with the purposes of the Act including the regeneration purposes of the Act which is one of the restrictions and and likewise commentary on the likelihood and the assists priority of any aquatic facilities of the process that we are putting this proposal through the greater crisis regeneration Act requires us to assess whether there is a an existing need for the proposal and whether it meets the purpose of the regeneration Act which is quite specific in what what tests it requires the proposal to meet and one of those tests is the test an identified need for facility for other facilities on the artist recreation said that there is definitely no need that can be supported for what facilities has that restriction however in terms of the gyms in the stadia or football facilities there is definitely an identified and fulfill the need for them in the city just some place so even though we 've been asked to prove it today we can 't make changes to it or we can no because then it would have to go back through the whole consultation process again we 're in a process we signed this off it 's been consulted with regenerate Christchurch DPM C NZTA and affected neighbours and this has been and that worked through what CSL directly so everyone 's kind of signed off on it and the minister will now be required if we send us to here the minister will be well at what yeah the minister will be required to publicly notify edge acute and receive submissions from the public on ER yeah no that 's fine I mean yeah I don 't want to slow this do I just think we think good to get some advice around the impact on our current facilities because I I just want us to be consistent and also the feedback I 've had from people like look jelly park is that Paul Graham Condon is that people actually there 's not a lot of space that 's they 're running at really full capacity so I personally just can 't understand what you have heard staff explained very clearly is that they take into account the future build as well we have committed to on our LTP cereal thank you just a really minor weeding question that might feel like a technical legal thing on page 22 of your thing and which is to forty one of our agenda so eighteen point in point two seven b2 and this is for an aquatic facility where the uses not a facility on-site wooden page the sustainability your own I 'm just wondering if the word nor mother all eighteen point page 20 to 18 point one 0.278 in ten twenty seven years and and which centers so it 's just facility would impact the sustainability of but surely it 's whether any users of and the facility will impede well no because the rules are actually not permitting certain uses so the assessment matters are referring to a potential resource consent where the proposed what would be proposed is basically the users that are not permitted by the rules so whether not permitted uses would actually impact okay so the not permitted is that is your plane to to yes just generally not permitted okay I didn 't you _"

27 years and and which centers so it 's just that we 're the users not permitted at an aquatic facility any users of and the facility will impede well no because the Durrell 's are actually not

    "text": "very much Oh Sierra 's sickened do that syrup you 're a substitute for a witch up on traffic light very good okay options for upgrading main pumps water supply pump station morning do you want to do a brief overview that would be fantastic thank you this report follows the overview of the water supply program it was reported up to unite us and focuses particularly on main pumps now main pumps down in Beckenham there 's a critical water supply pump station across the city it supplies 11% of our central zone and 5% of the water for the city as a whole we have six wells at main pumps all six attemping into equal to one so that is our shallowest aquifer the source water there has previously been considered secure but recent sampling and H testing has cast some doubt on this we won 't be able to confirm the status of that water until we 've done through the modeling of the aquifer and there 's some 10 to 12 months away so there are six wells and all six wells head below ground well the moment even got coronation at their pump station and we are proposing ultraviolet disinfection as an alternative when you say not considered to be secure can I just kind of say not considered to be secured by the engineers who are required to sign them off for meeting drinking water standards compliance that 's creeps those wells have been we 've been waiting on a plant is secure in the past period the is likely to be a permanent installation even if we do ultimately raise it 's for for other reasons the alternative to installing ultraviolet at this stage is to simply put this prompt station and the cue for raising the wheel hits and doing that work or building a new pump station elsewhere so those alternatives of course excellent all right so okay questions so Yanni so I 'm thinking thank you for the report I was just trying to understand so in terms of history for Christchurch and what UV treatment actually addresses so I think I 've had the response back around protozoa that we 've had no recorded instance of protozoa and you against bacteria viruses and right so that 's what I wanted to ask so for the non protozoa bacteria and viruses how many times have we detected those in our water supply there 's been one detection it main pumps in one will over what time looking back over the last five years right which is this relevant period to consider so in terms of value for money we 're effectively spending a lot of money on something that 's happened once in the last five years we are required if the if the either the water or the well heads are not regarded as secure we are required to put in a disinfection period so to comply with the drink New Zealand drinking water standards so there is a requirement regardless of the third criterion which is what you 're talking about it 's the detection of e.coli on the water so there are three criteria that we have to satisfy all three the source water the wealthy and security of the world hits and then the monitor of the polarizer the a bacteria if you look at the basis and this certainly drops the risk quite significantly it 's another barrier basically to anything happening so gives a surety but it also has the added advantage that it doesn 't add anything to the water the water comes in the sayings that goes out it 's got all the any potential bugs killed so just in regards to and I think I emailed through the Becker report so the report that came out from government made reference to had been a I think that was like an over-reliance on using UV to treat water which was expensive and for risks that were pretty low and I just wanted if you had any kind of feedback around that kind of comment in terms of the value for money in terms of what we 're doing here this is putting this money back into actually bringing the well heads to a secure status by raising them my understanding of the comment and the beaker report was around ultraviolet disinfection being put in place just for protozoa we 're not doing that here we 're doing ultraviolent for bacteria viruses and about was supplies that were filtering possibly fluctuated for flocculating and filtering the water then using UV and then using chlorination treatment as a residual and the reticulation as well so they were using UV as a filtering bracers approach to preserve and that 's a relatively expensive approach if you hear my pros are and just I mean just the far question if we agree to do this we 're still looking at a time frame of the implementation and then the monitoring which would be what about 18 months before we could even get these to be secure so we 're running these processes in Peru so once we get the UV treatment urn I thought there was a time frame where we had to monitor no we do the protozoa monitoring we started the protozoa monitoring ready so we we will know whether or not there are any protozoa to teach it in the world so so just between now and when the UV treatment gets put on what what time frame are we looking at from today if we agree to do this to getting these water Assessor to sign them off as secure once we have the plant commissioned and operation proposing June although we will look at bringing it forward if we can so thanks Helen for that explanation to in especially around it being a shut the shallowest aquifer and the city just for what you 've just seen is my question was really read when was similar to Yanni 's so basically although although in fact the monitoring is already started in in terms of but once the UV is in there 's a good chance that the water authorities the drinking water will say look at it it does meet the standards once the UV isn 't here yes and so there won 't be needle any long follow-up testing period required no I don 't think so right thanks Ellen well we don 't usually test reportes R so this is this is additional testing here so we taste for e.coli regularly successful whether we consider to extension to some other water supply the pump station or not yes we are considering using ultraviolet at other pump stations and we considering whether or not we 'll put an ultraviolet one is whether or not they 're drawing on the shallowest aquifer so on equal for one where we may need to add another disinfection barrier the second one if the pump station is regularly used because the ultraviolet light the lamps don 't like being turned off and on so if the if the pump station is being regularly used and then the third one if we 've got space to do it so that we can put the plant in place so we are running a ruler across the city at the moment looking at looking at those options these UV the kind of treatment instrument were shut down for the one to two weeks they already down or not yet you need to shut down close we need to shut down the pump station to install it yes yeah already that no on that year no year yeah what is your brain you know because this water supply for eleven percent for the city why we can cover that there 's no problem at all especially if we winter okay that 's the question option to remedial those where Kate is one point eight million dollars there is for all city while all still just part of the whale hated for those it 's but all six wells it main pumps that remediation all six whales at main pump C 's okay thank you just a correction on there it 's a living percent of the zone it 's five Percy by the city third sorry just to put that into percent of a zone that contributes to five percent so Phil did you have a question I wrote your name down yeah master I was fine and I need a son of the Queen Mike it wasn 't right I think it 's good sorry the you mean nearly received little bit center of the zone because it 's the zones so there 's only one hundred ninety five thousand people they 're trying to do the sums it 's about 20,000 40,000 seems to me here that the main driver here is the concern about the aquifer one water status can you just talk a little actresses owns around the city and what the council 's current position has been with respect to the quality of different quality of dinner yes so equal for one is the aquifer that is the surest aquifer so in the in the west of the city there is seem you can find or unconfined down to equal four one in the east of the city it 's reasonably well confined down to aquifer one and for one has performed very well for us and in it main pumps that provides a lot of water all the previous sampling and age testing fare for one at main pumps has deemed that water to be sufficiently old to be regarded as secure but the more recent testing particularly if the water chemistry 's shows some variability and so we are no longer as certain of the secure status or vector for one at that site so it does depend on where you are in the city in terms of what yet before you 're tapping into the lower aquifers so two three four and five all regarded as secure and the edge things on agent and some of its showing that it 's still having 50 years old water we also look at what is the percentage of water that 's under 1 year old and the drinking water standard talks about one to zero zero five and hope I 've got the nitrite percent I think I 've got the right number of zeros only so very very little and they do comply with that but as Helen says there 's been a change in chemistry so eventually has got Olga since we tested we did a real River in 2005 some of us got older for some reason and so now saying there 's enough variability that they 're actually real looking at some of the data and the detail to give us a very clear so with the sound fine at before one absolutely secure it aligns with the previous results is no change whatever and maybe some of this has happened because of changes in the earthquake you know you may have had a preferred sort of slightly shifted who knows and so they 're doing a bit in terms of taking the approach we are taking around the city of raising the wellheads you 're suggesting you be because you think there 's a potential that we don 't know yet downgrading of that and you 'll say that we shouldn 't it doesn 't make sense to wait those results otherwise would have to raise the well here well we we we will probably will probably raise the world heads anyway ultimately but they 'll go to the back of the cube in terms of that because for health and safety reasons and ease of maintenance and all sorts of other things we will we will raise them and bring them out of his practice for but we can defer that probably three or four years one of the other drivers for putting UV disinfection and is that as there 's an alternative to chlorination so we can take chlorination out of their power station okay Dion then David David I 'm just clarifying with the wells at mains substation so you 're saying that putting a UV system and now will get us secure status ultimately raise the well is does that UV then become obsolete well it depends on the results of the groundwater modeling and what happens with it before one if it 's not regarded as secure even if the well heads are secure we will still need some sort of disinfection so we have to meet all three criteria the source of water the security of the world kits and the absence of all I would say also the drinking water is based on multiple barriers so it is another barrier that in case something goes wrong basically if you 've got all these barriers something change happens we probably would use that infrastructure until it at least ran out of its useful life so you know I think we would be looking at that because it just is another barrier that gives us assurance it 's getting an anticipatory absolute this is the trouble I mean it seems to me that people forget what risk is you know that you know because what we 're talking about here is a you know that the chances of a happening is a you can never and I think sometimes people conflate the two issues and talk about risk when they 're really talking about likelihood so and it 's slightly different but probably a bigger conversation thing for today dealin yeah well I will ask what I was trying to thinking about before the the wells that we 've gotten the aquifers the city council or the city is the only one that draws from the deep equal forces there right was that that seemed worth picking but do we so do any others have them from the deep wells that the more the deep aquifers they do but there 's a lot more that we 'll be drawing it from the shallow aquifer echo for one I 'd have to check with Environment Canterbury what what the distribution was but there are a number of people drawing on a deep a prefers as well well I put the origin we are the we are the biggest user of the system yeah and so this is so I 'm gonna put that shallow aquifers anyway as they 're much more for the the aquifer and they don 't have proper backflow meters is that a risk to us as well so they are required to have backflow measures and those are audited as well and the the one of the joys of the christchurch system is that most of its artesian so the water is being forced up and if you like it 's almost a natural pick for prevention mechanism all right yes proof yeah just sort of a follow up actually I mean how many pumps do we have drawing water from AK 4 1 we have 17 wells in it for one from memory I 'm looking at jongmin cuz you can remember the exact remember but it 's a property approximately 17 am big for one sorry how many pumped stations I have to come back with you on that sorry just start to give you an idea there principally sitting underneath the portholes or alongside the footballs of the portals because there 's no deeper aquifers at that point in time that 's why that 's slightly different to the aquifer ones that we decided that we alternatives of deeper aquifers but because of the port hills and the way the rocks come down there is only at before one so if we decided to abandon main pump station for example we would need to relocate it somewhere else because there 's no alternative my understanding that main pumps to go down to 2 4 2 3 4 because it doesn 't exist in the geology of that point yes so my question was other pump stations how are we treating those those other stations in terms of are we raising well what 's the status of those so it 's a mix so at the moment those are being have chlorinated and most of them we 're raising the well hits but when we do the edge teasing of it before one it 's not it 's not it before one in any one place attack for one moving west to east across the city so in the West we know it 's not secure and that there are super some influences and we 've deepened all those wells in the east many of those wells and the water chemistry testing is how much risk there is that they won 't comply in the future so we 're looking at that distributive paper that was based on the 205 results which shows you the line we 're at 4 1 is considered at that point secure and Sakura and I have circulated I think I thought I 'd circulated to all the counselors but I can certainly circulate that map that gives you that line that shows where aquifer one is considered based on the 205 and so I 've got to put that proviso on his and all the pump stations that we 've got an apple for one at that time we 're secured apart from the northwest ones which you 've already addressed that was known in 2005 we were doing 205 those were the last time we did a full analysis of age and we agreed with the drinking water recession and we didn 't need to well we shouldn 't do it until the geology had settled down after the earthquake and that 's why we 're doing that you know that that the Northwest shallow bores were identified in 2005 because I mean there were brought to our attention until the 205 at that time they were showing no transmissions on on eco lies and whatever so no that wasn 't there was no issues raised with those words I 'm not talking about the transgressions I 'm talking about Oh requirement number one which is the age of the water the the security of the would have to go back and have a look at those results it was I thought you see that the 2005 report showed that it moved across the city sign showing of the okay it 's a physical line which shows where the confining layers begin quick for one and the East right so that 's not necessarily exactly the same thing as age testing and security but is related right okay memory that yes that 's true yeah that is true and that program being signed off by the drinking water system but yes it was an acceleration it may insist I 've got I 've got a short list of other stations a preliminary shortlist and will change so someone come off and others will go on but they include spreadin maize redwood belfast in Thornton so those all right Jonnie wanted to pick up on in the report that we 've got attached it says under nine to some page 163 there 's opportunity under the current health app to be deemed to be to comply fully with DWS NZ without necessarily meeting its technical requirements this requires the water safety plan is approved by the local drinking water Assessor then it goes on to touch on that we could agree to a different approach so can you just give us some sense of what conversations have been had with the drinking water Assessor and where things are at in terms of our water safety plan it 's one six page 163 nine and in the paragraph just under it I mean I 'm really just trying to understand the drinking water Assessor you know in terms of weird are at in terms of a level of comfort because it seems to me apparent that when we want to remove chlorine status signed off by the engineers for all about look don 't don 't don 't end a project before we 've even got to the sort of final consideration of it the the pointers is that if we can get enough water into the system that isn 't chlorinated and chem maintained through the summer we can turn off the client so that 's what we 're focused on we 're focused on up 100% everyone 's giving me a raw and I don 't think that it 's necessary to to focus on you know okay I was just trying to understand given the liver of its spinach are and given you 've said that I think these would go to the back of the queue to be raised to be secure for best practice and that might be three to four years so we 're really talking about possibly spending two million dollars before you know it 's another multiple barrier which is a good thing so it 's not wasted work at all think of the Swiss cheese it 's really good analogies the more barriers and I don 't that 's a point of order that 's appointed debate but you know the biggest just not people arguing with each other around the table I can manage the meeting and myself so so I can answer the question about the drinking order to see so so we have a regular monthly meeting with the drinking water assessor which is about an overview of the program and raising any issues that either we or or drinking water assess ahead with the program in any questions and we also have regular technical meetings on individual pump stations and individual proposals to ensure that the drinking water Assessor understands what the proposal is and as an agreement with with what airplanes are in terms of compliance with drinking water standards and in the report that we 've got it says that we could go to the drinking water Assessor with a water safety plan and we grieve a water safety part signed off by the drinking water Assessor we 've got one and a few anyway inside I don 't know what it 's just in the summary to make all the technical requirements of the drinking water standards Ajay we may not have to put lluvia and if we agreed the water safety plan with the drinking water Assessor I 'm just trying to understand the likelihood of that what if there 's a process underway to kind of present to the drinking water sister here 's our water safety plan the water safety plan is already signed off it 's one of the many differences as helen pointed out a new lars report that between us and Havelock North sorry but they didn 't have a signed off water safety plan we just I 'm just trying to understand so if we 've got a drinking water he 's taken one time and the report that is attached to support the concept of UV treatment as opposed to chlorination so simply to support the alternative disinfection x_._1627.28 '_''_1627.28 it 's not to do with what we 're proposing it may encompass sorry it 's a more general statement about an approach so there 's no chance that the drinking water assess that could agree to a is it would be it would be clora to use ozone treatment or some other treatment but what we what we 're proposing is the preferred option is ultraviolet so we have to have some sort of disinfection and at this pump station but if you 're so enamored of the report Jonnie the next sentences although there is opportunity to agree a different approach with the dwn and and capture thus in a water safety plane there is a risk associated with us as the DWA s approval could be withdrawn at any time this could result in any alternative solution suddenly becoming non-compliant as they would require upgrades or extensions to comply based on our assessment we do not believe that there are any additional treatment options that should be explored through there at present as these will either not demonstrate compliance or will be very expensive and slow to implement the most attractive alternative to the interim chlorination system as UV disinfection so I mean I I don 't know how clearer it could be and there are others out there that he hasn 't assist but the guidelines that are available then there are mountable in there on page six like emulation and directs and filtration filtration and bag filtration what I don 't so I get that I get I totally understand you know that the UV in terms of all the assessment that 's great approach to meet all the technical requirements what I don 't get and the first time that I 've heard is that we don 't need to make all the technical requirements if we can get a water safety plan agreed with the drinking water Assessor I think what it 's saying is that you could come up with something completely novel a completely novel water treatment that is not anticipated by the drinking water standards and is not covered by any of the prism guide lines you could document that in your water safety plan you could demonstrate then it reduces the risk adequately and get that signed off by the drinking water Assessor that is possible and she could with every time there 's a very difficult and long approach but it is a possible approach so and you have another question you 'd like to move it then seconder by all right move by n and seconded by Pauline those are in the discussion bill I think this discussion has been really valuable because clearly the questions raised in with really clear answers the Edison what I think the most complex issue that weird councillor dealing with and I do think the start for the clarity of the report and especially because you know we 've always known I guess that the echo for one the the shallowest aquifer has potentially had some issues and I think it 's it 's good that we 're being updated with the recent Water Research and I think the the report points to some real gains by using a UV system around these pumps because in that the UV system treats both the bacteria and protozoa we know there 's no silver bullet and as david has indicated to us having that multi-barrier approach will really assist us to get air water as standards-compliant you know I think this is so important because I think being alluded to what 't make sure of the security of air water and you know we so we cannot be complacent we cannot wait to get every sort of answer we need to build on the different the different interventions that are being made so you know I think it 's it 's clear though that in fact at a general level we as a council have already said to staff look we do want you to progress and look at the delivery of these alternative systems and works so that we can improve the wellheads and it included installing ultraviolet so I 'm very happy to support the recommendations today you the spikes see how Simon mout are often talks of no plan B and I think there 's one thing I disagree with them on because I always want to have a plan B and I think when it comes to our drinking water we need to be in position to not only return to clean pure safe and secure water and Christchurch but we need to ensure that once it 's gone it remains gone look the UV treatment technology short term ensuring that our water will be chlorine free for more people but if there 's ever a will or a push for widespread chlorination being that likely or unlikely in the future will be in a far better position to be able to push back from there as we have a genuine alternative to chemical treatment I think this is a pragmatic move that will hold us in good stead it 's one in the short-term it 's a one in the long term and I see it as a really pragmatic approach to mitigate against the so-called holes of the Swiss cheese aligning in future so very supportive okay thank you to me the a drinking water standard is where we crucial we are all aware but it 's kinda two different the way one is a we coordinated water but we are over where the people particular concern coordination especially recently we are over where for those that are kind of the water for the hot water the cities you know they have a cost kawashima so quite a few even have myself a who the otherwise new innovation this UV the candle of is a new innovation technology you with treatment even a moment is in the taste test stage but we 're a poof were not can be the kind of dealing with knows the protozoa and also to dealing with the bacteria etc at least there 's no any most of our coordination of what can be easy so you can compare these two and also you will particularly review the option one and option two but option one is that those is UV treatment and we can you know the to 11% for the water supply and also know the coordination of water we can go ahead the option to particulate is our one teaching here there particular mention consider timing because why the if you know the ground water modeling during early 2019 sure that April for one is not the secure then this movie the treatment still require so father regarding timing they were delay for another six months six months a citrus odor I think a puppy you know this could the mystic the option acting wife so I just very quickly because I know that we will this but look I really wanted to congratulate Helen and entertain me for for exploring these some fiscally prudent options and for making these recommendations today we know how complex the situation is we see different options for different pump stations at different aquifers with different well hence we 've got a short term in long-term programs work and our eyes firmly on that goal is removing this chlorine is but we as possible and I think we 're hitting down there trip really well so you know it 's amazed that you 're doing your reports to incredibly clear although they 're complex Syrah thank you appointing myself in the position of having something longer that I 'm going to cut completely because I 'm Jamie said it all so just quickly to summarize getting this started now it gets the chlorine out sooner and having UV in place at Maine comes is a key part of our Arsenal should we need to battle for an exemption well I 'm just gonna I 'm just going to say one thing all the time when we consider this matter that there are very explicit differences between Christchurch and Havelock north and there has been in my view a very strong reaction and I would say overreaction to what 's happened and and Havelock North it is a reminder of the severity of the consequences and we do support that the underlying thesis which is our obligation to supply safe water so we absolutely support the minister when the minister says we want to monster bleah safe water but the idea of residual disinfection as a as a mechanism when we know from reading the reports Havelock North reports that chlorination is not a an absolute barrier and in some instances you could say that it breeds complacency and if there 's one thing that you could never accuse the Christchurch City Council of and regard to its water as complacency we know we have a valuable resource and in some way although that this has been a wake-up call of incredible proportions it is a reminder to people how precious our water suppliers and it is really a call to action meeting the other night and that was very much the message that was received that we 're in this together and we can protect our water supply if we are to keep to you know the winter levels and we 'll get things done more quickly but I just want to remind people that in the Christchurch Havelock North contest they did not learn lessons from the previous outbreak we have consistently looked at the approach that wellhead or the read ruling and the Northwest that began in 2012 that was before Havelock north and we fast-tracked it as soon as they have locked north on Siddhant happened in order to create a safer environment as quickly as we could their aquifer was not confined we 've already heard a really good explanation of our aquifer system they had a high transgression history we don 't we don 't have the transgression history that they have and poor working relationships between the council and their Regional Council was demonstrably a contributing factor to the situation that they were confronted with and that is not the case here and they didn we do so you know I think that again I 'd like to just repeat what Pauline said and congratulate the team you 're doing a fantastic job and keep going basically repeating a lot of what 's been said but it 's clear that permanent installation of ultraviolet treatment system at main pumps water supply pump station is an obvious solution ultraviolet disinfection is an effective alternative to chlorination for the Christchurch water supply ultraviolet disinfection is technically feasible can be implemented in a timely efficient and it 's cost effective the main purpose and most importantly once the UV system has been installed in commissioned chlorination can cease at one of the city 's largest pump stations there is strong evidence that UV treatment delivers safe drinking water the near the Netherlands approach to treating water proves that the multi barrier barrier approach which includes UV is successful they don 't use crawling at all and and unlike the u.s. in the UK who do and have had four to five times the rate of waterborne disease than the Netherlands so our initial challenge was to protect their supply might not be safe we responded quickly and effectively with temporary chlorination and as we face there 's another challenge that we face the possibility of central government requiring a requiring us to chlorinate and we 'd have this opportunity now to prove that we are more than capable of managing our own fears when it comes to delivering safe drinking water without chemicals here is just another opportunity for Christchurch to lead the way in innovation in sustainability so totally supporting staff recommendation here today thank you I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much now we 're _"

    "text": "yes infrastructure transport and environment no sorry my design state infrastructure design standard sorry that came also to a tee Pauline would you like to introduce apologies for missing it one that 's right um so okay so the purpose of the infrastructure design standards is to provide the design standard service council funded air seats and assets that will be vested with the council through processes such as a subdivision to the yetee committee discussed the report and we 're now recommending the council note the approval of the steering group to the revised infrastructure design standards at the steering group has delegated authority you 'll note that the 120 submissions received anyone could submit on the design standards at any time during the year and the design standards are reviewed annually in the full documents are in a three-year review program currently these standards relate mainly to horizontal infrastructure standards that that we determine later if the vertical infrastructure standards may be contained into in rectum to a single document together with horizontal looking at 3.9 the main changes start have assured us if there 's any major they will come to the full council but these changes are mainly small ones so the main changes are really typos and clarifications although if we look at 3.14 that will be the interest because it relates to public transport and subdivisions so developers will now be required to show potential bus routes and bus stops and their plans and also noting 3.21 addressing the carbon footprint it 's in line with the council 's goal to recover by 2030 there 's some standards now and 3.22 which is addressing the zero waste by design so the tweaking of these standards are intended to deliver safer services and improved well-being to everyone involved that 's contractors staff citizens and the environment so this has been supported by the committee and you 'd like to move it in the seconder Aaron right Tim thank you another note in 3.14 the the subdivisions required to just outline and make sure there 's going to be room for public or for buses at City public transport and their subdivisions so is there any requirement for them there future planning and I 'm thinking because if we are looking at the ongoing pressures on Lincoln Road and the ongoing discussions of four laning debt and the detrimental to effect it could have in the Eddington village one of the things that could saw the net future planning would be there the ability to put a pack and ride somewhere and that halls will Erie for those people in Lincoln privat in Ralston and tight area Little River etc yet would not baikin but drive into that area and then baths or public transport into the city so is there any requirement or any vision for that I think from the park-and-ride point of young we 've talked about transport network it 's a big piece of infrastructure that we would probably have to pay rather than being part of a subdivision because it would serve more than just that subdivision that would be serving a whole area and so we 're certainly and we assume Lee having discussions around you know what is so the park-and-ride but I think it would come up as we would have to purchase way and then we would beyond it 's a bit like building a bus interchange you know some of those big chunks of infrastructure beyond this this is more for used to be called sub-divisional standards it 's expanded out from but it 's about the standards we want people to build infrastructure to that will transfer into our ownership so I think park-and-ride generally is a bit bigger than what 's covered in in this future particularly if you 're looking at the carbon footprint oh yeah there could be a future save you know like a silver stream in Wommack there we 're there next to the little commercial area they 've got a park and right there so it would be similar type of things so depending on the size of the subdivisions and activities that are taking so there probably is as David 's indicated would be a balance between what we might provide a bit substantial versus a smaller I guess it 's a long lines of town planning in the sense that if you have a park and ride close to a key activity area like also shopping scene those being you 've got supermarkets etc so rather than going continually so the the malls you can actually and get aid strength to those communities through economic benefit for those so I guess it 's about future planning and like with those subdivisions going around it it 's where do you put it so there must be some vision at some stage about because it is good or could be a large area of land and if it is all given to subdivisions no one 's going to give it up and it also becomes more expensive Council to purchase if there are subdivisions and I 'm just thinking future plan we 're talking about it all the time and we get caught in that ties into the district plan as opposed to into these infrastructure design tune so that would come to a resource consent process now if there were enough of them coming through we would then get some standard design that we could put in here however I think that planning that structure you did right but that is a planning issue rather than a infrastructure that condition dinner we would then start putting and this is our standard design as it is for a bus stop exactly exactly no thank you Yanni I 'm really concerned the what appears to be the sort of proliferation of traffic signals sir our city some intersections it 's really hard to kind of understand the design you know there 's traffic lights that get put on top of other traffic lights there 's left-hand turning arrows all the way of sorry right hand turning arrows on the left further astir corner which doesn 't seem to make much sense if you 're in that lane you can 't you get contact you turn right because you 've got three lanes of traffic are we able to I don 't know how much consideration being given on through here around the traffic light designs are we able to get like a workshop at least some around what the kind of current thinking is about why we 're seeing such a proliferation and the number of signals arrows versus you know I guess what was previously there and how our that one so again it 's a lifting of the ball within our design space and that 's what the design standard is is that we continue on an annual basis lifting the ball and went off chatted to the see guys what the indications are is that often a single traffic entity going in has obviously a domino effect up and down a road and we pick that up for instance and Manchester Street and so the idea is that over a period of time we modify them so we both modifier operation of our signals and obviously the design of our signals so you 're right Ronnie from that point of view that we continuously lift our bar on this process we 've got we can bring a briefing with the traffic engineers and see top to the either the itty committee or to council regarding traffic and traffic lights one of the issues you 'll find around particularly right turning arrows is because the rule used to be giving way to lift turning vehicles right had to head the right-of-way we have had a number of traffic but we are looking at doing that and part of this road safety provision of that but certainly we can bring a briefing if you look at the infrastructure standards they talked about if you have to put traffic lights and they become a bespoke design that we specifically approve so there 's no set of rules in there but there are certain place I 've got a example I imagine would be Augustine horse will Road there 's been a new set of traffic lights at Winona 's part of that subdivision but then they were bespoke they designed and they had to get signed off by NZTA in that case because it was a highway same with the ones out on the oldest thank you a nice more focused on high street charm street and and that 's not the infrastructure we totally separate issue we 've got loans that go straight up here you 're putting in traffic lights with right turning arrows where the lane can 't actually turn and so and I know we want to improve but there doesn 't seem to be some behind that but I do think having some understanding of why we 're seeing such a huge proliferation just even up on Durham Street there 's about you know any I 've because I 've been I 've been generous because I agree with you but this isn 't the infrastructure design standards as what we 're dealing with today not the actual decisions to locate infrastructure in a particular area but so how do we deal with that because you know I understand this paper so we 'll just lit pack it we 'll find a mechanism to deal with it but we won 't be dealing with it today so okay and then just the other question was so it 's great about the bus routes going new through new subdivisions are we also requiring that cycleways because that 's been one of the concerns that people have raised previously that footpaths and cycle ways are not clear through subdivision outline development plans and therefore we get a lot of debate I think you know there 's a classic the noble subdivision where that kind of came up the point of view of active transport we need to make sure that people feel safe on any road as far as cycling and walking because sectors concerned so at the moment we were require walking on collector roads and above as far as cycleways are concerned and that 's required from a point of view of when someone actually does a subdivision they 've got to come back and actually show that and those line markings we prefer that they actually go down at the time of subdivision in the past sometimes they haven 't always but the ideas again it 's a process that we can improve exactly like with the bus routes as well and we can actually make sure they 've all of those areas the standards are lifted over time we have got off off road cycle loans going through some of the reserves and some of the pathways so we are doing them I 'm actually seeing what the actual individual what the standards actually ask for that but we do look at approving as we approve we need to approve the final engineering if we can just thinking I just would hope that these actually have a really strong requirement for off-road cycle lanes link connections to MC ours through the subdivision and design standards so that we actually it 's the best time to get off road cycle rain certain and I 'm not I mean maybe I missed it but some developments don 't seem to be doing that through these standards we have to link those together so it 's something that we 'll go and have a look at and sort of see what we 've got in here and we to break into the next version very good it 's not just offroad that have been preferable but if they can 't_''_741.6 be off-roading the conversion itself during the planning of the subdivision good alright mmm excuse me I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much _"

within the policy and I 'm just wondering with that part of the policy of fixes at all do we have any dams I just don 't see it anywhere else and they when it comes to the effect of buildings that comes from the definition of affected building and no the Regional Council looks after dangerous teams the definition of affected building a 13 was on page 59 of the agenda means a building there 's a risk of damage or other impact from a dangerous building or haven 't pointed that out I 've just picked up that there 's a spelling mistake there it should be adjoining not a join and 3 okay [Music] so yep Yanni I was just running at a very high level that stuff could just sort of fight based on what we 've learned throughout earthquake experience in our formal policy what changes we 've put in place and this policy compared to the old yeah won 't cave unless we face very significant earthquakes and had you know but all the earthquake prone stuffs been taken out because that 's on the legislative framework now so but you know that so you 're talking about dangerous in unsanitary buildings yeah so and we 've got our legal representative at the end of the table so can you just be a little bit more specific about what you are asking so at a high level obviously the affected buildings are something I guess is one key thing that 's been picked up any other things that we 've observed over the last you know 10 years for example or eight years put in here because we you know we can yeah we 've got maybe maybe that 's really not a question for our legal adviser I 'm not really sure you know previously when we 've had this policy I mean we takes quite a lot of workshops and briefings where we developed it particularly post earthquake we 'd just developed it before that it was quake and September there was a lot of discussion around things like insurance and I know that this is not that we 've kept our own stuff but things like insurance makes you were a significant issue that was discussed last time because of the way in which we deal with things and what that means for property owners ok so there 's nothing in here that deals with insurance but the if a person has a dangerous foreign territory building that the council 's identified and there are insurance issues that is a matter that the staff dealing with the potential enforcement action would take into consideration in terms of the discretion about what enforcement action they might take the issues what is building you know em you know are there insurance issues that the business dealing with and just I mean I guess just the funnel and maybe it 's more of the chair the acting chair of that committee but you know to do something about buildings that is as we are that are clearly causing concern for local people and you know it 's scale Art Factory in Wolfson as a class Oh covered in graffiti broken windows overgrown grass nothing seems to be being done is there anything in this policy or any other work that we 're doing as an organization that means that we can be more responsive given the significant increase in those types of buildings because of it as as where yeah I think we talked about this this probably isn 't the place for that but the ECC touched on that I think I think was at yesterday 's meeting in the development forum is going to be looking at that and there are a range initiatives carrots and sticks around that and we have investigating exactly what you 've just said the abide come to the development forum on Monday though too because we will be discussing it if you 'd like I may regret saying it you notice because the development it 's the burnt out houses that 's there for three months we supply that constantly get re vandalized and have arson attacks because they sit there and no actions overly taken because of our policy um well is a seed announces the I think all the council 's got the email when I asked about the eyesore buildings so you know at a certain point in time and I saw building may well pass the threshold or there may be enough complaints and and evidence that makes it compelling that its offensive under the building it to become an energy we build it and then we take some action but it is quite a high three shot yeah so um but I mean I 'm getting the sense that there needs to be another regulatory intervention that isn 't the dangerous and unsanitary buildings one but as another teeth which has to go through a proper bylaw process which is act and help that powers that I mean I think some of that stuff has been discussed with you in terms the various sites buildings issues yeah the different enforcement options that may be available for a ssin as you can hear around the table we 're just reflecting what we hear from the community people are sick of it they 'd like to see their communities restored to some semblance of order if not it 's not never going to be perfect but we can do better so but but I 'm getting the sense that it 's not this regulatory framework this is specifically required under the buildings act and it 's something that we 're required to do this is this for me and we really need to better show and deal with it separately all right so Jamie would you mind moving David even though you weren 't there would you like to see conduct I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "just move in seeking the apologize no we 've done it you moved up major second yeah so that 's okay so now we move and we 're just gonna deal with an item that 's that clean Livingston has an interest on the capital endowment fund application so if we can deal with that before he leaves item 19 so Tony could I invite you to give a brief overview thank you which is should we partner with a healthy homes cannery service which I 'll talk what about what their services in a moment mmm obviously if we pan it in that service we can then provide whole of home advice if we do not then it will be a sales focused advice that the residents will receive as part of that service and then the second question is of course how much would we contribute to that service should you should you choose to and there 's three options discussed in the report what I 'd like to do just now is take a moment to talk about the difference between whole of home advice and sales the report so I thought if I just give you a sense of who 's involved then you understand what we 're talking about in investing in and potentially so for the residents it takes about one hour and the sister comes to your home oh sorry sales folks of our spheres to become sales focus advice focuses on the features the benefits the product so a heat pump sales person for example we 'll talk about how quiet the heat numbers the cost of the heat pump of course the size you need to be a home the benefits of having heat pump they 're efficient and to talk about the location of that heat pump and talk about the after-sales service for the heat pumps it 's going to describe the benefits of their products and and the features there that product hairs and then you will be able to access a loan from the Regional Council to help fund their appliance but their advice and their focus will be on selling their appliance to the homeowner which is totally fine and if you need a heat pump form of advice which is based on the bill Beck smarter service that the City Council is currently running which will end when this new service starts and for the last war since the earthquake tilly 2013 we started the service we 've service have helped about five and a half thousand homes and make their homes warmer dry and healthier by giving them whole of home advice it 's free advice from an expert a trained professional they are qualified in a home performance assessment that 's the the of course they run us a three-day course and they also sign a an agreement as to how they will behave so there 's there 's a high level of quality associated with your advice they provide it 's no obligation advice its in-home advice so the person comes to your home and walks around the home with you looks with a little fun aspects of your home and gives you that advice and then they also write a healthy home improvement plan so it 's a written or list of things that you you can do to improve the the benefits and the costs of making those interventions and it 's specific to the person into their home so it 's at least about the products and more about the dwelling and the person that 's how bill box Manor has run and this report proposes to continue that type of device but to link it to some other financial support that 's available so the advice that we provide through box motor covers all of these different aspects and I just want to take a moment to give you a sense of the sorts of advice that they provide it 's one hundred and fifty dollars to provide this advice the assistant is in your home our and then another hour to write up the advice and give you those recommendations so it 's two hours worth of work from an advisor Soph usually they assist the home then they give you that verbal advice and then they write you a written report on all of those aspects so let me give you some examples of the sorts of things they talk about they 've talked about drafts to stop hate lost and for many homes in christchurch the the drafts around the windows and doors amounts to about this and the size of hole in your wall so it 's basically the wind literally blowing straight through you organ your doors in the windows making your home taller likewise because our windows are so poor talking about full length double layers of curtain us you can increase the room temperature by two degrees without adding any heat at all just by having improvements to your curtains so they 'll talk about how you can do that and the best ways to fit those curtains to your home they 'll talk about the sources of moisture in your home and where you get the moisture from and because Christchurch largely is built on a swamp we also get a huge amount of moisture on the ground which is about 45 litres a day coming into your home so they 'll talk about where those the moisture sources come from and then we 're that moisture goes because in the home that goes to wherever its coldest so cold windows but it also condenses inside the walls the floor and even in cupboards and clothing that 's in the cupboards so thinking about where that moisture goes and then they 'll give advice on how to avoid that moisture in the home the importance of opening windows the importance of having a plastic vapor sheet on the ground a plastic glue on the ground to stop the moisture rising out of the soil and the importance of having ventilation in the kitchen and bathroom to get that moisture out of the home and obviously not drying clothes inside having a flue gas heaters which produce carbon monoxide as well as moisture for the home they 'll cover all those aspects they 'll also talk about the importance of insulation and minding the gap brands have done we research that shows that even a form to get which is tiny reduces the thin performance of your insulation by 15% so they 'll look at the condition of your insulation and give you advice around that both the fit and the deep importantly they 'll look at the damn lights at heat out of the room because the way that down lights work as they heat up and because they heat up the act like a chimney and they actually physically suck Peyton out of out of the room but also because they heat up the insulation needs to be set back from the lights so you have a gap of space around the lights so you 're breaking really the thermal performance of the insulation than you are in your home so they 'll give advice around changing those to LED and IC routed lights which then can be covered with insulation that you won 't have their heat loss from your lounge the importance of light LEDs you can save twenty five dollars a light bulb if you change LEDs for example ripping hot water cylinders again eighty dollars pace myself for one year so the importance of just keeping heat and in your home and making sure you 're not you 're just heating the water rather than heating the space around the cylinder in this case AG saw eighty dollars a year saved and even just switching can save hundred dollars a year and if you can if you having difficulty reaching around the back of your TV to turn off the switches you can also have remote controlled switches they actually allow you to switch off the lights remotely so that 's that 's a quick sample the some of the things I 've talked about in your home and then this is an example of a piece of a healthy home improvement plan and it lists the actions that are recommended the benefits of taking those actions it prioritizes them for your home and then it gives you an indication as to the cost for each of those things for your home so the person after the assessment has a high little understanding about what they need to do for their home about the benefits of making those changes and then understanding the costs so healthier homes can agree it 's a funding service it 's a available to all rappers in the region region-wide up to a maximum for 6,000 home owners ratepayers Connexus alone from the environment in with the recent council takes it 's only one home loan to the Pierce and run when the lone pair right path sorry so if you 're a landlord with multiple properties you 're just allowed one went alone but equally that one line has to apply to all of those things you might want to change so it applies to ceiling heating appliances kitchen a bathroom fan moisture barrier and draft stopping now this is the first time that we 've ever had financial support for drafts topping and a moisture barrier and a fan in the home so this is a unique opportunity for every since to access this type of funding through bill backs NATO we we managed to achieve seventy five percent of the homes that received the advice took out their advice they but they may change their homes and the main reason why they didn 't was because of the financial constraints so this links an advice service to a funding service but there are other sources of funding as well not just from the regional council there is also funding available from Iike that 's the government they Trading banks ANZ they 've also offered a zero interest loan for insulation and we 're encouraging other trading mix to do the same and then there 's the curtain Bank of course from Community Energy Action which people can access curtains and then other product discounts so there 's a range there 's a suite of funding available for people to access but the key point is in order for people to access they need the confidence to be able to access that those funds so the sound advice and the financial support deliver the highest level of uptake so that 's that that 's a quick run-through really on the the background to this and why we put bringing this to you today and I 'm happy to explore questions you may have but I understand there 's some questions around some finances and details which I 'm happy to reflect on there if it 's fine so if I could ask you to tune in reports to the first table which is Table one I just walked through the table with you what page is that on like to do is just walk through the table with you so you understand the sort of breakdown of the of the costs and we 're their eyes so in this particular table we 're talking about 1,000 homes per year receiving advice at 150 dollars per home now that 's the total of 150,000 of course we 're estimating that the next line down about 300 people will take up the home loan about 300 but if they take up the home loan you can fold into that loan 150 dollar cost or if your self if the provider is selling a heat pump they may choose to waive that because the heat pump is a large item and they could probably give a discount from the provider because they 're dealing with a service at scale so maybe one of the suppliers would would offer that as an incentive so what we 've done is we 've assumed that all 300 will either roll the 150 into a loan or be waived by the provider which then amounts to 45,000 and then that leaves 100,000 105,000 remaining and year and that 's an indicator da and the next slide down is a 50,000 one-off carry forward so this financial year alone there 's a 50,000 carry forward the next line is because there 's a gap between the financial year to June and before the service starts in September we are still continuing with a build X amount of service and so the advice is still being given to the residence and so the cost of paying for that advice that 's happening between the two services there 's 20,000 and so then the bottom line is topping that up the capital endowment fund requests along the bottom line 55 85 and 85 and that then means the total council contribution per year as listed along the bottom so that 's where those costs and that 's kind of same for each of the of the tables in each of the options you know that 's actually incredibly helpful and so as always your presentation because I guess what you 're saying is that with all of these different financial support options available to people if they were some better choices about how they might access those through it during the build back smarter service provision we surveyed every year to kind of understand how the service was being received and one of the one of the comments will correct me if I haven 't is that people appreciated that the advice was coming from an independent source consistently through the years that the program ran and so that 's another thing that and another offer that this this provides this if the advice service was supported me I 'm Sarah thank you um this does look really really good and I know nope it 's not has been really successful um two quick questions why would someone choose to roll 150 dollars into the loan when we 've already offered to pay it so we if with this particular proposal we 're talking about a thousand homes receiving the advice yeah and so that was made up of the cats or support and also the loan the rolling of their money into the combination both so if you choose not to take up the Regional Council 's 'll leave self funding the part that they 've been proven to themselves they 'll be putting in the draft stopping with the installation or whatever it might be on the road was the cost of the advice yeses so if we 've pay if we 've offered to pave the cost of advice why would a resident being choose to not accept the hundred and fifty dollars and to air that to be alone if you like yeah so at the moment the way the service is structured it 's it 's if you take up the loan with the Regional Council you lose math so it 's not a choice intended yeah it 's just a default seeding of hell yes okay and that allows us to provide advice to more homes yeah which is great it 's really good and the other thing that 's on her so 4.9 councils on page 168 and it looks at the level of funds going and different options no all options include a review of the service after three years in preparation for a funding proposal to the long term to be really good to know how mean not just how many people but actually what advice they have taken up not just the number of loans and things but the had really data from the outs is on actually the types of improvements the impacts of those that kind of thing because it would be really good data to have for a long-term pen but thanks Tony for very clear I 've stationed a house where the wind has been coming through the windows and it was in the house where a person was English as a second language it 's on terms of when the adviser goes into a home to help that person is that advice did they stay with the person so that they can explain in talk and take them through so I think that would do any important yeah so you know the adviser comes to the home and in the example you 've given if someone who doesn 't speak English well or it might be that there 's an an elderly person in the home we do encourage a second person to adviser is trained to be careful about how they treat a person and also even just walking around the home they don 't enter a room where there 's no where the owners not there for example so they 've got careful way they they manage the assessments but yes the sister stays in the home for that hour giving them the advice around all the different aspects of improving the home and then they receive later over support about the about home human emotions it 's very good so if the person didn 't have access to the Internet for example and in terms of applying for the funding and all those sorts of things that would be also support was given through this so quite often people can just phone in and ask for the service to be delivered to them most because when we haven 't got a lot of money to spend on marketing nearly all of their bill back smarter uptake has been from word of mouth so people who have taken out the service and in that telling their friends and family members to you can ring up by phone as the two main reasons ways to connect okay can you choose to pay for it yourself the assessment yeah yes yeah yeah you could and I 'm sure that we haven 't seen that up in the structure here but yes you could yeah because I mean it seems to me that I mean if they were some good publicity for this and maybe even today 's the beginning of that you know someone like myself I could afford to pay so I 'm gonna ring up and say I 'd like to get the service but yeah that sounds like a great idea I mean some of the stuff I know because because I know other stuff I only picked up about drawing inside which I do all the time when I went to the eco-home opening you know the insulation opening that they did just recently yeah and I it just never occurred to me because you don 't see it happening yeah that 's so so damaging so now I 'm in cz didst open a window but never it um Yanni yep my understand I don 't pick up something that you said that previously the service was just independent advice my understanding from previously because of lack of funding there were companies that were providing the advice they were also selling the products is it correct so the way the service is delivered so I miss that and in Christchurch we have three service providers who give that advice and one of them is Community Energy Action another earcon their core New Zealand Limited and then Smart Energy I saw em give me just mount up about energy smart who 's associated with Tirith on so those three companies have sent their staff to be independently trained through the Community Energy Network and then those those are their official home performance advisers and their signs some protocols around how they deliver that advice and those three companies then have those staff going to homes giving that advice so it does sound like a heat pump or a sell an installation company is coming to your home giving you information about their products but actually the way the advice described in a very brand neutral way and then the homeowner is left with the decision what would they like to to do it 's entirely up to the homeowner no obligation advice is what we 're providing and then the homeowner then is informed about the different financial supports that are available and then they can make their choice but they don 't know that the person 's represented their everyday job they will know it 's they know they 're on it but it 's not a product that 's that the leaf details about it 's as soon as we are paying for it built reveal box matter is an advice service filing from that company okay yeah so in terms of any evaluation have we looked at how many people have been a serious and then what the uptake is in terms of products from which companies so in terms of the uptake we 've do customer service and the customer survey results were that 90% was satisfied there 75% of the homeowners they received the advice actually took action in their home but we didn recommended to the homeowner that I haven 't got a specifics about what they take out no I understand that but just in terms of transparency if you 've got and you know I understand why you 've done it the way you 've done it but but I do think in terms of transparency that is actually quite there is already raised this is a mechanism for collecting very rich data and obviously the what people take up you know linking that to the to the to the actual advice that they received use who they receive it from is going to be a significant part of eret yeah how to make it intended to patients first when it 's on page 170 in here particular five-point attend the bully point of one in the two I just want to know hot solution there you pick up the twenty two percent thirty thousand homes rather in the fifty one thousand homes no thirty two percent because I review the five hundred thirteen yo particular emphasized fully insulated and ten home is much harder and closely to eat so the most threes the thirty thousand homes yes fifteen wonder Stan that 's correct so I was just giving in so that the piece of the report you 're referring to yeah lists a whole lot of different challenges that we 're facing as a country in Christchurch yes and I just in the other parts of the report just referred to the one which is around insulation but you are right I mean boys Chur and dentists and the homes is a very significant issue for for Christchurch which is listed here brains have done research just recently that 's come out with assessment for the whole of New Zealand saying that half of the homes in New Zealand have visible mold in them half so we really have a big problem with their moisture in New Zealand and this is an indication here so I didn 't want to in the in the analysis I wasn 't really digging into all of the different aspects that we could address but we are going to be addressing all of those aspects of insulation ventilation moisture management when we provide this like to you know get a wise or service how can we do if knows one outside of the least 30,000 homes so the advice service we could provide through this is look a thousand homes a year so we do have guides that talk about the ways to warm up your house as well and we will revise these with the new branding of the new service there is also eco with the energy spot advertising on television to talk about the different ways to care for your home and then there 's tools that you can have on the website too about understanding the different aspects of your home and there 's little videos online that helped so there and we are also working through the health boards so talking about the medical centers in planket and those sorts of groups getting this information out there so that people understand the ways to make their homes healthier and more energy efficient okay thank you second questions page 168 we talked into the option winder the figure you emphasized up over all three years is 335,000 yes well this thousand dollars so the piece way to look at your figures is in those tables and there 's three tables one for each option yes and that details the the we 're those amounts add up to and what I 've just done in this piece of the brought you 're looking at there 's just summarized those akhiya to enter and for each option so the three 155 is a summary of the table that gives you more details of every the funding and all the money comes from thank you thank you um have we looked at including this in their own social housing at citrus so I understand that the City Council is embarking on an obviously repair and rebuild process and that does include effectively a high standard of living for the dwellers have the helping trust at citrus side yes we have a massive amount of properties and yes the community rejection is being used to insulate those homes there 's part of that in doing yeah program is underway and but also in addition they 've also included life Mac standards in there too of energy but they 're also good to to use in terms of the life stages of people have been good to know those numbers also meet your counselor session at record and all the other day and there was a social housing tenant who obviously hasn 't been included in it at this stage but I guess it 's obviously going to take time to get through them all but there should be the priority for those people who are actually those areas and most in need and it 's at their own since ridiculous and I realize that but it seems a bit slow no one else Pauline I 'm serious we have the data of it he doesn 't that well-being but it 's also these initiatives are reducing the cost on you so do we have any weights this without breaching privacy its but if people are actually finding yes so there was some worked at well I 'm not sure the year sorry but it was a few years ago there was some work done with Community Energy Action where they work with the DHB turned up to the doctors so they invested 1 million dollars into into homes and in that same year because of people not tuning up to the doctor and not actually needing a night in hospital they saved a million dollars a year as well so I think it 's about a thousand dollars not for a person in hospital so that person only needs to be in hospital for two nights and you 've paid for the installation of that home which is it 50 or what happened so if you focus on the most vulnerable in our community you get the biggest benefit and that 's why in this report it talks about a 1 spent 6 returned infant because the elderly the young ill if they are the ones receiving this then this support that will dramatically reduce the health cost all right so Ben would you like to move maybe your comments yeah yeah yeah but but I want to really get on the table yes so wouldn 't you which option are you removing the staff recommends I 'm right okay so move by gleam thank you me for allowing this to be first on the agenda so I can attend that the funeral thank you Tony also for that the most compelling presentations I 've ever seen this is a good example of the joined up process with our Regional Council is you know it was signaled in the LTP for consideration through the rates neutral capital endowment fund the actual quantum per annum is much less than it used to be under the former build backs smarter scheme and we from Tony house I configured differently now we have a really sound reputation as a council for the previous scheme and it 's unfolding through built back smarter the press wrote a very complimentary editorial at the time giving a big tip to the council for rolling this out you can see through the report and the presentation today that the advice if this wasn 't funded this advice wouldn 't happen rather people would be left with hidden miss advice from those who supply insulation they wouldn 't give that comprehensive overall advice what flies under the radar but you see it know about road deaths we don 't know so much about this but this is part of the reality and you on the positive side of the equation the returned benefit as tony has just said is six to one so I always had a hunch that warmer drier homes would lead to fewer deaths least illness greater productivity and the workplace radio apps radio attendance at school but this actually you know provides a figure six to one I can hardly think of higher cost benefit ratios so I urge your support for this it 's a great thing we can do the actual quantum isn 't much it 's less than what I signal to you in the LTP process and be tremulous if you can support Thank You lien and thank you I reiterate again said staff I think the work that has been done it 's been tremendous and this proposal was an excellent toe actually green loving son you reminds us about the importance of housing and warmth and shelter in terms of Maslow 's hierarchy of needs and this has this fits this program for your city in with 30,000 homes and critical need in our city that 's a huge number and so this program will go a long way to its supporting lien and that whole advice path is clearly crucial for people to understand what we 've been had that good fortunate today to have it be given a good understanding of quite quite a difficult challenging problems from different perspective different ethos of your life different perspectives and it is Glen see the leverage and payback for this it 's just tremendous in terms of six to one it 's an it 's an excellent investment and I think having something up which actually for private householders to compliment requirements of landlords with new legislation this makes good seen so I guess the overall thing tone in for everybody 's health is it won 't lead to a reduction of fossil fuels that 's about it clearly clear in the report and that 's something that we would all want clearly at wintertime when electricity uses its peak those times that the Huntley coal burning power stations are bought on to eliminate so I certainly support group support the staff recommendation and what Glen here co2 and supporting and supporting there I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those

Elizabeth Luton considers the current self-regulated threshold of 146 decibels used by LPC for their current land-based piling very LPC should be constantly measuring noise levels not making assumptions set the piling will be under that level throughout pile-driving operations of 2015 and 16 littleton port company use marine mammal observers to monitor the area surrounding pile-driving LPC says they do this again they would do this again for the new booth design however this there is no indication at what stage of the piling this monitoring will commence there is a different standard of care being applied to this particular project which puts the port recovery plan under scrutiny firstly using marine mammal observing program alone has little ability to effectively protect dolphins and virtually none from behavioral impacts as for each dolphins spotted over above the water and novelized below this is fact during previous Wharf construction using rammed piles hit two sightings were recorded within 300 meters shut down zone during pile-driving LPC project director Jared Peterson advised that on the 27th of July he still had no idea who the train to mammal observers would be and who would be training them though he did believe that poor thron would be initiating this at some documents for peer review or opinion and their observers would only be used during sea-based piling currently more than 330 land-based piles have been rammed into rocks of the entrance of the Inner Harbor and I used land-based very lightly what 's again a photograph I took on Monday as you can see from the photograph the piles are exceptionally close to water level offering basically no land between piling and water itself mr. Peterson also advised that noise levels of the current land-based piling were below their self-imposed threshold of 1 4 6 decibels but was unable to accurately tell me what nibbled as New Zealand has no underwater noise regulations except for the voluntary code of seismic surveys LPC is applying his own untested data in an environment that needs special attention last year LPC contractor quorum to conduct an assessment of the effects of marine mammals for littleton port companies channel deepening project authored by deanna Clement with an assessment the he pers dolphin Peninsula population is listed between two and six thousand individuals well research published by scientists published and scientific journals by at our university different with such inflated information informing piss-poor risk management they can belittle confidence of impact and mitigation accuracy therefore the real issue we need to consider here is the noise pollution to itself the pile driving and the piles itself Dawson and Luna s 'en offer the only research and recorded the recordings offered by rammed PI noise pollution in the area during previous consent process in last year marine scientist Eva Luna s 'en approached politics might Abbot for advice on using screw piles although the original piles were 1200 mils and the piledriver technology was not available in New Zealand mr. Abbot did say screw piles would be viable if smaller well this brings us to the new birth design James would also politic offers conflicting information he said that while pipe piles right screw piling would be quieter engineering the viability in the situation was the issue that lines us to the end of the 5 minutes I will give you I have requested all relevant information from LPC 14 days ago I 've also done a legume oh I have no information on the design the requested a civil engineer with 50 years experience in wolf design has requested this information and is going to do a peer review for me for free however without the information I am able to advance this further it 's not up to me or others to conduct this vital research it 's up to LPC and it 's up to you guys as shareholders by manipulating this designed to fit within the scope of the port recovery plan I 'm sorry but LPC is avoiding proper scrutiny of its plans and actions we ask for transparency expert advice peer review Marine Mammal observers now not in two months time we ask for safety and risk procedures in place and the postponement of piling if necessary until next winter thank you very much [Applause] so and thank you very much indeed for the presentation now there are a number of documents that have been uploaded to the hub for councillors so we 've heard the presentation this morning we 've got a number of supporting documents that are available and have been available for councillors which is their QA documents uploaded further counselors as well I 'm sorry you don 't get any credibility unless you 're published in a scientific journal all right so I note that comment I also want to acknowledge the letter from World Animal Protection which has also been circulated I think the most sensible thing to do with the information that you 've provided us this morning the written information and what we 've heard verbally this morning we 've got Paul Monroe the chief executive of C CHL who 's actually in the public gallery at the moment and I 'd like to refer the matters that you 've raised to Paul so that he can refer those on to LPC and so that we can get some information back from LP so you addressing the issues that you 've raised and obviously that 's something that would then be considered by councillors but allow us to get the information back from the port addressing the matters you 've raised there some new information that you 've raised in global presentation but it certainly would be good you know we need a level to C CHL so that we can get that level of confidence back from LPC or ask for the questions as we need and is the way to go so thank you very much indeed for taking the time to present to us this morning thank you so apparently we 've got Yanni Johansson who has joined us this morning by AV link Yanni good morning welcome to the meeting great to our second item of public participation this morning we have got the so in half spoon problem-solving team now this item will take the form of a presentation from that team and then I 've got some certificates to present once the presentation of occurs occurred so we 've got a five-minute presentation first and then I 'll be very pleased to present some certificates following on from there so if the students would like to come up to the front thank you you 've arranged all of this winners and the title of the problem was or is let 's bike Christchurch and it involves the unique promotion idea which they put to our committee earlier this we absolutely loved it and we 've expressed a strong desire for the council with them in any way that we can to keep this project up and running so without further ado let 's hear from the girls themselves all right so you 've got five minutes to present to us and then we will present the certificates so yeah welcome and we 're certainly looking forward to hearing from you this morning we want to increase usage of the sacral lanes in christchurch we will deploy succeed it 's like cracks which stands it looks like this any local cafes in cycleways once you find your bike you can take a picture that it uploaded to social media using the hashtag lips like christchurch we wanted to get a sweep of the community involved with our project so we decided to contact local schools around the cycle lace to decorate these bikes they did a wonderful job with creating them and we had a strict criteria that we want to do the follow and they 'll throw them very well we also got aspect to island school to were presented sowhen haskó in the future problem-solving national competition in Auckland and this year we represented New Zealand in their future problem-solving international conference in came out in third place we also been working on designing the website using Squarespace information about our project and why we decided to do it videos that link to the pressure city council and of course how do you work with our project the website is syllabi can prove in progress but we really launched it in September and we have also created a PSA a public service announcement video what they have our IT technician Jimmy this video helps with my idea and get people a good idea of what we want to achieve on behalf of the lips like pastures team I want to say we would like to think that ite Committee for all their help and support throughout this project now we will show you a PSA all right well we 're trying to get video to work there any questions that some councillors might like to ask the the seventh house team [Music] [Music] [Music] great bless some did you know then amazing the cycle network is under construction is part of the earthquake recovery program car seat is now crisscross with dozens of kilometers of cycle lanes shared path and designated cycle ways we can now bike around Christchurch safely and quickly [Music] something that sure to hear you add to that on your body so in high school is patty with the clash City Council who took boys 16 gets black car trip signs oh so get on your BOTS put the leaf spot cross each side then post a pic of yourself with the side and upload it to social media using the hashtag let 's mike fossum [Music] [Applause] so thanks for the excellent presentation this morning and thanks for showing us that particularly excellent video as well as some great stuff so congratulations on the work that you 've been doing promoting cycling in Christchurch but also congratulations on winning the New Zealand stage of the future problem-solving competition and also well done for being placed third at the international future problem-solving competition in Wisconsin I think that 's that 's a huge that 's great and even better that you 've come here to tell us all about it this morning your projects got the potential to have much broader benefits than just for yourselves and for the school we 're obviously creating the the major cycleways Network in Christchurch and one of the reasons we 're doing that is to make it safe for school students to get safely to and from school but also there 's a recreation benefit to having those cycleways there as well so it 's absolutely fantastic that you 've come up with this project to encourage children and families and people in general to get out there and really use and enjoy the cycle ways and of course everything that you 're doing is promoting the fact that the cycle ways are there and encouraging people to use them so what I 've got now is some certificates that I 'd like to present to you to really recognize the the great achievement that that you 've got here so we 'll present the certificate so I will invite you to come forward one at a group photograph at the end if that 's what you 'd like to do all right so I 'll call you up one at a time okay so I 've called you up one at a time so first of all clearly Claire I am a next Sophie Hodgson I 'm next Lucy main hard Maya hostile [Applause] read MacUser Bonnie Smith Phoebe Donald [Applause] last of the students are certainly not least cape girlie we 've got a certificate for the teachers where our Dell staples we want to make sure we can get our warden at the back to the cycle ways yes [Applause] fantastic thank you thank you very much indeed okay so that into the public participation section of the meeting we 've got one deputation still to come but before we and we 'll move to the deputation next so I 'd like to invite one Kandla sh m to the table please so wrong good morning thank you for joining us we 've got a paper on the agenda that what you 're presenting potentially relates to so we 're treating this as ten minutes but that would include time that you might want to leave for any questions so maximum of 10 minutes including questions clearly we 've got some literature which has just been distributed now and so you have 10 minutes to present to us this morning thank you very much about the victory question of chlorine in the water supply my name 's Ron McCandless I 'm the CEO of a company whose American technology that offers a far better alternative to treating water than chlorine and I have a folder here with a few items in it which all go through the very first item is a picture of the Royal Washington DC which was a mess of presentation with over 400,000 gallons of water there in the form of reflection pools and fountains it is entirely treated by this disc aromatic system and is maintained since 2004 in sparkling condition the second picture is in the machinery room for the War Memorial and it shows descaler medic water treatment and also on the wall there are two copper silver ionization units that are used to disinfect the Taiwan showing that there 's quite a bit of flexibility with the system there 's actually three two hundred gallon a minute units the intended working into a manifold and the same can be done with the copper silver ionisers to next piece of paper is from a company called carefree clear water limited who actually manufacture systems and it 's actually still used today in the international space station so it 's got to be good because there 's no tax up there summary the copper silver and zinc ions cationic and supers active and extremely potent biocide positively charged ions form electrostatic bonds with the negatively charged sites on the micro organism cell walls distorting permeability and preventing the proper intake of nutrients this couple will protein denaturalization causes cell lysis indeed bacteria were killed rather than merely suppressed ions provide residual protection and prevention of any recontamination once a ionization is 100% effective in all water temperatures prevents corrosion and all types of piping there 's an excellent biofilm penetration was extremely low residual effects and as affected throughout the entire system of plumbing including the low automation of an economic benefits documented improvement over the last two decades this is not new this is well proven technology then there is some notes and quotes from some professional papers the one in particular here which is extremely powerful its experience of the first 16 hospitals using copper saw violin ization for Legionella control and implications for the evaluation of other disinfection modalities this is the world recognized paper written by Jenna t-step who 's a PhD and Victor oh you who is a medical doctor I 've done highlighted some of the some points in here work over the whole thing but the conclusions from this study represents the final step in a proposed four-step evaluation processor for disinfection systems that includes demonstrated efficacy of Legionella eradication anecdotal experiences in preventing Legionnaires disease in individual hospitals control studies and individual hospitals and validation and confirmatory reports from multiple hospitals during a prolonged period of time between five and 11 years reversal ionization is now the only disinfection modality to have fulfilled all four evaluation criteria of the 16 hospitals responded to the questionnaire the hospitals were in these are not small hospital and 56% of them performed transplant surgery all of the 16 hospitals originally surveyed in 1995 responded to the follow-up survey in 2000 almost all used in copper silver ionization for Legionella disinfection the duration of system operation ranged from 5 to 11 years with a mean of 7 years 94 percent 15 out of the 16 continued to perform routine environmental monitoring for Legionella at various intervals kissing was performed quarterly in four of the hospitals every six months and for the hospitals or annually in three of the hospital 's the emphasis here on Legionella is it Legionella is like the canary in the coalmine as far as pathogens in are consumed on page three no cases of possible acquired Legionnaires disease were diagnosed after the installation of the proper silver ionization system in 94 percent of 15 out of the 16 of the hospitals one Hospital did report a case of hospital-acquired Legionnaires disease soon after installation basically before the system had settled in now our discussion disinfection and modalities currently in use for Legionella control and hospital water distribution systems include and type of chlorination wiper coronations has proven disappointing as a long-term solution due to the high expense the pipe corrosion the introduction of carcinogenic byproducts is at the drinking water and difficulty in maintaining a high concentration two to four parts per million of chlorine needed to sustain efficacy in the past few years carcinogenic byproducts from chlorination and increases in birth defects and spontaneous abortion have raised concerns from federal agencies and consumer interest groups a meta-analysis of ten case control studies and two cohort studies concluded that the risk of cancer from the consumption of chlorinated water was significant spontaneous abortions have also been linked to the consumption of chlorinated water although ozonation instantaneous heating systems and ultraviolet light will conceptually attractive solutions and field trials failures have outraged successes no control studies of five years or longer have been reported for any of the three methods control studies have supported the biologically plausible concept that the single most important factor in decrease in the incidence of hospital-acquired Legionnaires disease is the eradication of the reservoir for this microorganism the uniform finding of disappearance of hospital-acquired Legionnaires and different geographic areas confirms the primary importance of the reservoir and the causation of Legionnaires disease in fact there are no cases of hospital-acquired Legionnaires disease during the four years from 1990 and 1999 to 2002 75 percent or 12 of the 16 of the surveyed hospitals reported the failure of previous attempts to control Legionella by other methods now that brings us to the end of the ten minutes so thank you ask you just to quickly wrap up that would we 'll be great thank you okay the fire also contains another paper here from American Society of healthcare engineers confirming what we 've just learned this is a very good table we 're looking at all the different forms of disinfection of water once again copper football and I said organization is highly regarded and the other papers in here are from large American companies that are independent of those papers I 've just quoted they have worked with this gal Ematic for decades and have found the the water treatment systems to be absolutely first-class all right thank you very much indeed for providing this this morning unfortunately that doesn 't allow our time for questions but what I am going to do is to bring the water paper that 's on our agenda up the agenda so that we discuss that next we 've got the literature that you 've provided thanks very much indeed for taking the time to present this morning thank you thank you so if we next move to so those reputation by appointment item for presentation of petitions there are none item 16 the resolution to include supplemental reports in the meeting so I 'm happy to move the resolution that we receive and consider the water supply program report in this meeting so we 've got that in front of us I 'm happy to move that Pauline 's happy to second all those in favor against that 's carried and now let 's move to that supplementary report which is item 17 the water supply program of case so Helen welcome to the table thank you very much indeed for preparing this report and will invite you to speak to it in just a moment I mean passed back in April where we raised a clear expectation that the chlorination of the water supply would be for 12 months any extension of that would require a further council resolution it 's great to have this paper in front of us today showing us the work that you 're doing towards reducing the amount of chlorine in the water supply and obviously turning the chlorine off at certain pump stations and what the program looks like to reduce the amount of chlorine and get more and more on chlorinated water into the network as we go so I 'll hand over to you to speak to the report but thank you very much indeed for providing this detailed information to us today and we 're still exploring other options in terms of maximizing the delivery of untreated we have moved from 5% of the supply and we expect to have 24% of the supply without chlorine treatment by the end of August so that 's from the four pump stations out of our 53 the four pump stations that are permanently without chlorine and another seven where we below ground wellhead and maximizing the delivery from a secure above-ground well it 's so that 's the reducing corene across the city we 've also got the first tranche of major remedial works underway that 's another seven prompts Asians and some of those overly the ones we 've temporarily isolated so it 's hard to keep track of the numbers but that first tranche of works delivers about 17% of our supply and once those works are completed those those will be permanently without chlorine as well the second tranche of works there 's some 17 pump stations 49 wells across the city and that 's where the indicative timelines for that work begin in February next year and run out to 2020 so that is where the timelines are are quite challenging in terms of the major remedial works with outlined in the paper some things that we 're doing to try and advance those works the first is to get more drilling rigs in specialist contractors on board there may because they 're really one of the biggest constraints is the number of wells that we where we 've talked about water conservation a second possibility is to do some interim remedial works to some of the below ground well hits that are in quite good condition and get sign-off loads and defer the major remedial works and the raising of those above ground to further out so two or three years out another possibility is rolling out more ultraviolet treatment so we 'll bring you a paper 23 members of council meeting on ultraviolet treatment for mania bucks and that remains an option for some of our other larger pump stations around the city and we 'll have a look at that another thing that we 're doing as we 're doing works on the pump stations is we 're we suspect that some of our pump stations could actually deliver more water we 're doing some stick testing of those wells and maybe that we can deliver more waters from some of our pump stations in by upgrading some of the pumps here so that 's a the other aspect of the work is the research that we commissioned into international experience and you silver bullet in terms of public safety so the experience in Western Europe and particularly in the Netherlands where 85% of their supplies are without chorong shows that you can get very good public health outcomes they have rates of disease that are four or five times lower so it 's good to see that it is possible so just reminding you that you will get another report on the 23rd of August the ultraviolet main and you can expect another report on those tranche 2 weeks and some real time lines given exploring all of those other aspects to accelerate it thank you very much we look to questions and Phil Helen thank you very much for your report it 's some very full and clearly backed up with the other reports well just your point about the chlorination not being a silver bullet and you refer to that in your report so I 'm just wondering get given that to the case that in fact from the report purchase our people wouldn 't be protected from the protozoa say I 'm just really wondering why the hemlock north a primary defense bacteria it 's just not the only barrier so there are other barriers that can be used in combination and still get those public health outcomes and I guess one of the other ones you 're going to give us more information on the next report it is the UV Thank You Glenn Thank You Helen on the same thing that feels just I haven 't got the report or access to it today what are the main barriers aside from coronation used in those European countries because we know that this is about barriers of which chlorination is one there 's a sense in which we are putting peps New Zealand all the eggs into one basket so the yeah I think that New Zealand the current drinking water standards do talk about a multi barrier approach and the the key principle really coming out of the heavy lock north report is that you should have a very high standard of care and vigilance about any public water supply and they may go on to talk about a multi barrier approach they do regard chlorination is experience is that it 's not necessarily an essential one so in terms of the Dutch approach the the first thing is making sure you 've got very good source water and they favor ground water over surface water because it 's generally safer in clean water source and indeed that is one of the criterion for secure borders here is that we have good source water and that we we constantly monitor that and know that it 's good this is in the second part of course is in your head works so having that secure forehead and the works that we 're doing to improve us and then looking through your whole network so ensuring that you maintain and run you will need to work very well indeed and that you have very tight control of any repairs or maintenance so when you 're taking things offline and putting them back that you 're very clear that you 're not introducing contamination Thank You Polly chemical treatment should be kept to a minimum but they do here the higher cost for delivery they have lower leakage and lower water compared to New Zealand in the rest of the world yes and but we have patron transcriptions and their reticulation yes we have so generally at our reservoirs what 's the main place where we have ecoli transgressions we have and we haven 't had any recorded outbreaks of waterborne disease either from our networks but we do get the occasional ecoli transmission on our network and those rates are higher than experienced and in the Netherlands well I 've never seen any transmission rates and John Matthews constantly told us it usually committee that we haven 't had any transmission Dave Davidson may wish to comment on there you spend a lot of money on doing that kind of work transcriptions are reported you will see them reported in the quarterly or linked to monthly report good job but normally at the low end we chlorinate we retest 24 hours later and I 've gone so they are a little blip but a natural fact our water safety plan says we will move very very quickly on even the little blips constantly being principally in the reticulation but one you 'll always get some minor with just questions within the reticulation system yeah thank you so just to reinforce it this creature thank you thank you ref Vickie and then Aaron ref yeah Thank You Helen I refer to item five point four two point five on page 13 since the counter the earthquakes and until December 2017 the cities of some water supply had a provisionally secure status and complied with the drinking water standards without the need for treatment twenty second rule was 2017 the annual compliance report was received from the drinking water Assessor confirming that the Christchurch water supply was compliant with the drinking water standards at that time that changed obviously in December when the Director General issued a loss of secure water status I think my question is we were quite happy with the water supply at that time yes it would be future so the reason that we 've chlorinated is because we were facing a compliance certificate from the medical officer of Health not because we suddenly were worried about our water supply we had a we had the regular back saying that they would not be signed off as secure until that point we were not 11 I think and we were raising all of our below ground well heads to above-ground well heads we very had a very very extensive monitoring program over that quality of water coming out of all of our well heads as well as in the reticulation so we 've got a multi-faceted supply we were not getting transmissions out of any of our well heads and so we were and you were we were advising and we were putting money into looking after the breakage in our reticulation we were looking at upgrading now well it 's certainly well hits our reservoirs because of because a lot of our big concrete reservoirs hand cracked you actually replace quite a significant amount of them so we were putting our effort our concerns at that time reticulation end and on reservoirs yes and that 's really where we were put in our effort so we not have any concern probably had no concern about the water of the quality of water coming out of our that report that came from the drinking had been shared with the medical officer of Health so we had an improvement program that incorporated the slow upgrade of our well it and that improvement program was agreed by all parties as at the end of June really yeah thank you things change obviously from the second report from have Rock North Thank You Vicki and then Eric speaking minds to you Dave and concerns the 5.44 in terms of the current review of the three water sector being led by the Department of Internal Affairs who I rang this morning just because having read all their data what concerned me was that they were actually putting the cost of drinking water wastewater and stormwater from the small local authorities who face a massive bill on to urban areas so I 'm just wondering in terms of the model then they 've provided of Christchurch being linked with these possibilities do we know anything about the cost of for example two thirds of the South Island in terms of bringing its drinking water wastewater and storm water up to speed and people of Christchurch sees cost has been quite a large barrier now there has been some work done by the water managers group that 's gone up to the chief executives quarry I 'm not sure whether it 's gone on to the mural group looking at the Canterbury costs but I can come into that so I hadn 't gone to the mural form it was really just a stocktake and the information is included in each councils long-term plan not all counts have budgeted for an increased cost over and above the original maintenance so they haven 't even budgeted to get there not look because they don 't know what the standard is going to be right so it varies across the various councils right okay great thank you Erin yeah thanks thanks Ellen now just a little bit of a follow on from Vicky 's point around that regional usage because when we look at the recommendations that have gone to government following heavily up north and like perhaps if we had no concerns about our water supply Paul in the race that no one 's and that was confirmed by Alistair Humphreys we 're kind of like this feels like throwing the baby out for the drinking water by putting the whole country in the same basket and when you look at on page a wool 5.4 for the MEPS the people one of the top half of the South Island or even the one that covers most of Canterbury if there is to come in would you go to the lowest common denominator in which case would end up being chlorinated because out and DA field they 're pulling from wells and the they 've transgressions all the time or various areas around Canterbury does that then force us into Florida chlorination rather than staying independent drinking the best drinking water in the world and not treating it like other parts of the country so one is the Department of Internal Affairs review of the delivery of three water services across the country and there are there is no doubt that there are problems with the delivery of those services and the quality of those services across the country particularly in small centers so piece of work is the Ministry of Health work looking at the response to the devil up north inquiry stage to report and it 's that that is talking about setting up an independent drinking regulator so it 's a regulator not a delivery model and that that regulator would be the one sitting what the drinking water standards would be now I 'm pretty sure that the drinking water standards will continue to take a risk-based approach and that something as prescriptive as chlorination is likely to be in the context of that risk-based approach so it would depend on what the issues are for each supplier and it wouldn 't it wouldn 't be a blanket requirement to do any one thing for every supplier in the country but currently that is one of the recommendations is to chlorinate the whole country there is a recommendation for mandatory chlorination but they do also discuss the what the threshold should be for any exemptions and if you look at the cabinet paper in response to that inquiry which is where you have to look for what the government thinking they 're they 're not saying okay we 're going to do this tell us how we should do it they 're saying give us further advice on the issue of mandatory chlorination so if you 're going to go independent then that flies in the face of 5.44 because if you win across even just all of Canterbury which is one of the models or the two thirds of the South Island is Viki caught up which is pretty close then you just there 's no point in treating them separately when they 're all the same so at the moment around the country we already have shared services models and council control organisations that deliver numerous water supplies they don 't all use the same treatment for the same source and community so for some source waters and communities there will be one set of treatment processes for a different source water a different reticulation in a different community they will use another approach because the the type of treatment that you use in the system of Barry that you need depends on the quality of your source because you have one organization delivering multiple community supplies doesn 't mean that you do exactly the same treatment system for those supplies so the governance and management arrangements are different to the technical treatment arrangements and give just my final question then is if this model is to come in or something similar to because I know it 's been discussed that mirror forum and so on and so forth given was still at some form of a democracy will the people actually have the option to have a sound not just a consultation but will there be an actual vote where the people of Christchurch can say you know what we want to be completely independent drink our own water tree their own water the way we want to treat it or not and that 's a question for the Honourable Nanaia Mahuta because I was concerned about it I think it 's important that we understand what 's going on okay there 'll be the opportunity to talk about the conversation you had with internal affairs during debate if you wanted to I 'll come to a the in 5.43 you mentioned that in this report it states that the principle of public ownership of existing infrastructure will underpin the reforms that the local government will and that local government will continue to be involved in the considerations of the new models but then in 5.44 it says current examples in New Zealand the water care in Auckland and Wellington water which accompanies yes their own yes the shareholders are councils but they have independent board so the worry that I have in the question I have is this or do you see what they 're proposing and what you 've written in these two points is it actually a company will dictate to councils what 's going to happen and in their councils and public people 's such as all we have to pay for it I think there are a lot of conversations that will be taking place between local government and central government before any of this do you think from I mean that 's I 'm reading between the lines of what 's been written and I don 't think that 's fair what the implications of that will be but they Helens right and there needs to be a whole lot of conversations with central government they may well come and dictate what happens they may not it 's quite revolting but I think asking our staff no I 'm just asking because it 's being written in this report what it 's doing is quoting the minister and the review so far from the DIA saluting you today yeah so this is judge these paragraphs really are just stating the the situation as it currently stands obviously there 's some decision-making that needs to occur within government we would hope that local government would have some influence over that decision-making to what extent that 'll be the case remains to be seen but some I mean certainly the minister has made some comments not least at the recent local government New Zealand conference here in Christchurch that suggests quite strongly whatever you might mean and there are two different conversations of course one of which is and officials two officials conversation and the other of which is a political conversation absolutely in front of us today Civil Procedure and then I 'll come to Yannick yep Mike that 's similar to the costs at the gardeners pump station here so that was for developing new worlds so it 's quite a little more work in developing a new will then there is a remediating an existing room I know you talked about that the north west side will soon be so is there a point in time where that zone can be at a hundred percent for the rest of the city yes the northwest zone is likely to be one hundred percent before the rest of the city and do I have a timetable for when it 's likely to be no I don 't we 're doing so further modeling work and particularly around that step testing of the pump stations and see if we can deliver more water from the secure pump stations so until we 've done that modeling we can 't really set out the timelines for it Thank You Yanni will come to your questions oh great you received responses back on so I 'll level I 've also circulated a paper that was written post earthquake and I was looking at having smaller water supply zones and I just wondered if the stuff could just give us some sense of our current water supply strategy and how the work is related to the strategic approach that we 're taking as a city in reference to our water supply strategy in this report I don 't see reference to the document that was written by staff and I think a consultant post it moving towards really interested to know from that wider strategic point of view how the work is being proposed and to that thank you that 's the first question downstream effect of from well hits really this is the work that Helens doing is around well hits and we 're now looking at reticulation particularly if you have a look at the report that got presented giving the European or deduction the German experience showing the low levels of were leakage from their network compared to our own we believe that if we go down that track might lead us into an going in and out of those zones so that we can get a far more accurate that 's a piece of work that 's been done at the moment it 's quite difficult for us to come up however with a strategic document when there 's so much unknown up in the air with central government now we believe that there may be a report back to cabinet in August there might be another one in September and there may be a follow-up report in October but really the main decisions we don 't think up until the middle of next year potentially but we are doing some work around that and around our strategy around zoning around our reticulation around you will have recognized we 're doing able to work around pushes owns as well which all feed in to that same picture so there wasn 't work being done on that however we 're not in a position really to recommend anything because there was we 're such in a state of flux so just in terms of the work that we 're currently doing have we looked the equipment at the same time rather than having to come back and spend more money on contractors and consultants for the durmitor doesn 't really affect the way we zone manager our supply and as Helen says we 're doing quite a lot of modeling through our network and the zones change depending on the time of the day and the time of the year and basically you 've got big industries a good example would be industry pulls a lot of water from a tool maybe five or even longer than that true in the day households pull a lot of water during early morning at night and so the zones shifting we 're doing a lot of modeling around exactly where that water flows but I couldn 't guarantee anyone who and where they got their water from but the management of the zones is almost on the stage the water supply strategy is it was supposed to be reviewed in 2014 I don 't believe it has been reviewed can you just advise where the current review is that if it 's been commenced if it draft a working draft of the integrated water strategy which takes into well it combines the wastewater strategy the water supply strategy and the surface water strategy that we currently have as three separate documents that draft has been on hold well we 've been working with my Tahu over the stormwater consent now that the stormwater consent is back on track if you like and has been given what 's been realized isn 't it and notified again with Environment Canterbury we 've picked up that draft and we 're arranging workshops with the local area groups and that will come up to Council as part of that we will then have a water supply implementation plan and we 've begun work on that we 'd be doing quite a lot of work obviously around earthquake damage that we 've had and Satre Fuxi as Helen says the the comprehensive stormwater consent it 's probably been entrained for the last four years so that 's a significant piece of work as has the new regional land and water plan which has also had quite a big impact not only all of our surface water issue so there has been work been going on in the background but yes it hasn 't really surfaced at this point at a council level because basically we 're still pulling all the threads together to actually give you that integrated approach and we believe in integrated approach is the right way to go because they have all got into relationships with each other okay thank you just the specific questions that I put through to the briefing as well I just to respond to those or do go through them again so you 've got them so there are questions that have been put through as written questions is that right Johnny yes correct yeah and you received a response to those so just I 'll just go through them they 're pretty quick but one was just I know that someone in Y met counselors obviously have water supplies signed offers secured by the TWA and I was just wondering what examination we 've given two thing that we can learn from what they 're doing with consultants in contractors in looking where they have a similar secure groundwater supply and have not been coordinating that supplier in the past so yes we are learning from other territorial authorities okay do we have any sense of that we 're being treated the same as they have in terms of the assessment by the engineers in terms of the standard of our well it 's my impression is that the engineers right across the country have a very similar interpretation you will appreciate we got the peer-reviewed and there was slightly change but we did look at that so we believe that engineers right across the country are really interpreting the drinking water standards to the same reasonably same level which is a marked shift from where it was probably 12 months ago it 's also obviously a shift where we could do work in an improvement plan and that was fine there was an improvement plan as was raised by earlier in the discussion but that 's now we have to deliver that and that 's really what Helens doing and you have fast-tracked through the LTP okay just two final questions doing further work given that they were involved in the ongoing maintenance of the well heads that is part of the reason why we got to the situation analysis of maybe the situation however we do our work in very close to a city care and partnership to make sure that what we have gotten our maintenance contracts gets delivered gets monitored they 've got a whole range of online systems that we are now looking at by doing regular monitoring of all the coronation all the temporary works the water staff are working in close partnership with City care at the moment to deliver the outcome that we are expecting we need to maintain so we are looking and ensuring that we 're getting what we are asking to be delivered to a quality that we are being delivered so the final question was in regards to just the social and the community initiatives work on the distribution of water filters filling containers from service centers at libraries and also and in a location of collection points but I just don 't see much consideration of the social and wondered if there 's been any progress in regards to those those issues that have previously been raised but I haven 't seen much progress expended we now have a met that shows clearly where the chlorination has been reduced or removed right across the city and we 're getting we 're getting very high counts of people going to see that map and we 're also distributing that information through social media so there is certainly anecdotally a lot of social connection across the city where people are going to click their water from someone else 's house if if they 're close to a pump station that still has chlorine and they have friends who do not so I think that as we reduce the chlorine levels across the city there is much less of a problem with that and certainly the number of taste and odor complaints has dropped dramatically so we have much fewer complaints right so it was so clear we are not going to do any work around providing a location for people to get untreated we designated a tip where you can drive pump stations are that have no chlorine just someone in the area they have to hope that that person 's not connected to another water supply that is getting you know I guess I am frustrated that this is reportedly being raised have been told that this has been worked on and we don 't see any progress the issues of supplying that water but we are still working on some of it you did also raise the issue about filters and I might just ask Ross because we have you know you put a filter in it still needs to be maintained and so that 's one of the real issues about getting that information as part of our network as well so that you actually just because you put a filter in doesn 't necessarily mean it 's going to certain quantity of water because we did look at that at one stage of putting filters and we did provide you with a memo about photos into some of our libraries but the costs and the maintenance and the need to get industrial size filters was just going 'all_``_5599.14 need ask everything from you that 's great thank you very much Sarah you 're able to comment on the we 'll have a look at that I have two comments one is that we are looking at minimizing chemical treatment so that is an alternative chemical treatment rather than having either no treatment or something like altra violet which has no residual so that would put a residual and to the reticulation and copper and silver levels are controlled through the New Zealand drinking water standards my understanding of the levels that are required for disinfection now that they 're below the maximum acceptable values so it would comply with that but we would also need to look at making sure that any any new and innovative treatment that isn 't listed in the drinking water standards is accepted by the drinking water Assessor in the medical officer of health and that that might be quite a process as well as looking at the costs copper and silver by the end of the month hopefully 24% of the it would be at least 25 is even so when we 're doing is we 're looking at what it would be looking over a whole year yes so in the wintertime it 'll be much greater because you 're favored those those conversations and so in 5% sort of to start with anyway its Creed and so we 'll have a number of pumps where we installed what turned out to be relatively expensive temporary chlorination equipment that has ended up being used for only a couple of months or maybe for some of them less than four months and I 'm wondering how much we 've ended up spending on temporary equipment that actually hasn 't been used for very long so that equipment isn 't being discarded so that equipment has been cleaned down and and health for if it may be needed over the summer period or if it may be needed in another application okay but at this point we 've had chlorination and some of the pumps for a very short period of time and when as ref was pointing out earlier the risk may she hadn 't_``_5762.08 changed at all since since that been an expensive exercise and there 's no evidence that we 've got to improve public health outcomes from that 's right thank you any further questions Jimmy what consolation campaign because special information but I didn 't see any the incentive scheme whether can encourage people and fully understand a moment is a kind of extraordinary activity whether each one right where they need to serve in their water consumption so and we we haven 't yet scoped what the water conservation campaign will be over the summer what we 're doing is saying that we if we want to continue with works through the summer period we will need an effective water conservation campaign and we 're going to start by doing a survey to determine what the appetite for a water conservation campaign would be and what types of measures people would be happy to roll out across the city so we 'd like to do that work first and then put in place a water pencil conservation campaign over that summer period thank you sarah vacuum of the city who won 't see as much of uncorrelated water supply in Sochi the framing around it will be I think quite important as you know for the good of the city because many people will be uncorrelated by then that 's correct the the sad news for the people who will be uncorrelated live in if the demand goes up right across the city push framing that really clearly will be really important in the information atrocity and when you 've got a question yeah it 's just in addition to that around their messaging and that is that Christchurch sees itself was quite an environmentally friendly place yeah last summer on the first weekend of December we used the most water in the world per person and we need to be we 're not I don 't think we 're aware enough of that we don 't look at that we don 't look at how much water that it 's like 650 liters of water for every single person in the city and the day there 's an incredible amount when it 's when it 's drinking water quality this is leading to a question questions yep okay great so can I have a mover for the use of Vicky right so you want to move what 's in front of us with an additional motion attached as well yeah thank you so make it very clear the department 's returning the face that the council is totally opposed to being would become our authority which goes beyond Christchurch City and means that water is not a function of a directly elected Authority and our residents been required to pay for the cost of remediation drinking water storm water or wastewater for rural and smaller than authorities in South Island do we ask the me to write a letter page I 've invited if I may speak now yep so we 've got a mover for this Vicki and we 've got a second to deal okay so Vicki or indicating you 'd like to engage in debate easily just in relation to and I realized I 've got a short time so I just want to focus on that part that is around five point four four and five point five five and five which the three waters are merged and if you read through the Internal Affairs Department documents that sit with it and the minister 's speeches it is absolutely clear that they are faced with major issues in relation to the quality of drinking water storm water and wastewater and local authorities across the country especially small local authorities and when you read their papers it looks as though let 's solve it by making much larger areas for those three water authorities and actually making sure that the cities pay for the rural wastewater stormwater and drinking water where they have very few staff very few resources and in the South Island especially around Canterbury very major problems so we are sorting out our water making sure that all aspects of it are at the highest possible standard and then post October this year there are two things coming to cabinet one is the regulatory and then there is this structure that has been created if you look at our budget from last year 40 percent of our topics goes into water wastewater stormwater so if you take that out chunk of what we do of our capex it 's slightly less it 's 28% in overall of our budget thirty four point two five percent this year goes into those three waters there is a massive chunk of this council no matter what happens in water the people of Christchurch who have a very strong emotional attachment to all aspects of water need to be able to go to a directly elected Authority not a company that we 've appointed not our regional authority not a standalone thing no company thing it needs to be a directly elected authority to which they can go and tell the fact that they are angry or happy or whatever so what we are getting into with this suggestion and and I mean the two suggestions that you 've got in front of you are four and these are not definite yet but I think we need to be very clear about where we stand I spoke to the Department of Internal Affairs this morning and have invited him to come and speak to all councillors because we haven 't all had the that through the Mia 's Department now and I think that 's really important but if we are going to take you can you know that what 's coming at the smaller rural authorities who have had massive issues with water who have major lakes to to sort out the point of what this is and you don 't need to read between the lines it 's actually in the lines of the documents from a dia by the city so bad news christchurch ratepayers because you 've got an earthquake and the government promised that they would bring you back up to speed and they forgot to do that and then you 've got an issue of small rural authorities who can 't actually deal with this problem and so bad news Christchurch residents and ratepayers you get to pay for that as well well no I 'm sorry that 's not okay the cost of actually fixing the drinking water and throughout New Zealand as I understand it is about the cost of transmission County so the government actually needs to decide which is more important water or for them to say Christchurch City ratepayers you 've just fixed your own water it 's quite major cost and now good news you fit and get to fix kaikoura west coast nelson melbourne who know he 's so one way Mac as well could we know have major problems so I think we need to be very clear about this and I know this is only part of the water issue but there 's so many parts of it at the moment I just want to focus on this one and I think we need to make it absolutely clear to the department of internal affairs that they need start looking for other alternatives one simple one would be that they could actually take the GST on rates which I don 't even think is I think it 's marginally legal and actually apply that to sorting out water storm water and waste more throughout the country but they have not considered those options they 've only considered these sort of options so I think we need to be very clear upfront that we 're standing up for the to pay and what we 're prepared to do and just so that there 's no ambiguity about it whatsoever Thank You Glen thank you I support Vicky 's comments wholeheartedly Thank You Helen for your and Tim for your update and in the recommendation where it talks about best endeavors undertaking that work there I was at the minister 's or tend to the minister 's speech rather at the LG NZ conference she said many things one of which was any solution must put our context she said that herself in the context of having been to the UK coming back here but in New Zealand whether she didn 't specify whether it was a New Zealand wide or local context but one thing about our context is that we big on his self-determination which Vicki has just touched on and to me that extends to every ta in the country so our context for me is the question and with regard to Alpine feedwater our very good testing regime I had a conversation with a long-standing councillor of a to 24 years did you ever have any mouse somewhere in the system and Rickett him but it wasn 't a big drama it was quickly overcome so we haven 't had any health outbreaks from our water system we 've had the odd eco like transgression map one thing we do have in terms of context due to is a good functional relationship with our Regional Council one of the factors identified in the headlock employers that set behind the break-up there and the fact that it could have been prevented if some of those relationships were better and there 'd be more proactive for me this is looming larger than it 's about us being or becoming even more risk-averse as a country is it about chlorinating the water or is it about becoming more risk-averse so I 'm fully behind what pickiest put is putting forward today I 'll pick up race point that something changed between August and December but it wasn 't the water it was the goal posts goal posts on wheels and they started shipping out of everyone 's which I 'm looking forward with my colleagues to becoming chlorine-free again the work that thank you Dion and then Pauline deal I just wanted to echo councillor buck as well my my real concern or not actually I 'll come back to the concern that I just wanted to say thank you to the work that is being done as well echo in the words Glyn was saying and I think we should be celebrating some of that work that 's happened and being accelerated because it is pretty tough pretty difficult from some of these reports if you read them how complex some of the workers but I am concerned that the goal posts will continue to move and I am consumed that in this report we have two paragraphs that actually talked about specifically what 's going to happen next and we have no control over there under the work we 're doing at the moment so my concern is that we 're doing all this work at the moment and actually the goal posts will further change and then the goalposts will further change when we have to start paying for or the public starts having to pay then the city ratepayers and and right throughout the whole country don 't actually have any control over there and that 's a a big concern and which is why I support the the the additional amendment that 's been put forward because we do need to say that people who pay this pay this work to be done actually should have some sort of say in this because it is going to cost a lot of money it is going to be difficult and we do have good different circumstances here around the supply of our water which comes from under the ground I mean I find it ridiculous how much water you know and on the west coast they get six meters of water a year you could just open your mouth when it rains and you get all the water you want but they 'll be put under the same rules and regulations that we do here and other places I mean you could just go down to a river get some water and drink it and they 're gonna start sort of regulating rivers so I a very interesting time moving forward but thank you for the work that you have done and I do think that moving forward we are going to as a council have to have conversations because in this report it does explicitly say that that 12 month time frame in the January resolution will probably be not be able to be met so I think we are going to need to have some conversation very soon about how we manage that and what we actually do and what we say to our communities Pauline and then Sarah to make the deadline come hell or high water hell and high water I 'd also like to congratulate Helen on this amazing report in SD on here still it 's incredibly complex we 've been all over this many many months now and it 's still very difficult to get your head around the many facets of this situation in its ever-changing home all of those goal posts but look you know basically you know we 've chosen criteria council is chosen to be proactive in if jump done and our upgrading program so we 've chosen to treat this as a learning situation and you know I think it 's big ups for that we 've opted to spend millions and millions of dollars none of that has been wasted no matter what happens in the future so it 's a very fine balancing act knowingly we 're and how to spend that money into congratulations again for handling that very well and we know that by the end of this month our 24 percent of our auto will have no chlorine and it I mean that 's fantastic in a reduction of the dose by heart which is awesome we also are looking at we 're running a parallel program we 're short tuned to keep that chlorine out in a long term to ensure that our infrastructure is robust in best practice and I love what you said Helen about we 're planning in we 've doing at the same time we see the report on the Dutch practices which have been hailed as best practice if we follow down that path which I hope that we do we could will not be supporting any government mandate for price to be financially supporting other TAS and the affordability creating beer three waters we 're doing all we can ourselves spending millions of dollars to assure ourselves and our residents that we believe our systems are secure and the government should look for other ways to support our surrounding two years rather than leaning on us to support them we won 't be the financial winners of that one and we do risk losing control we 've had youth quakes floods fire and now the chlorination all costing millions if not billions of their rate payer dollars because this is significant for Christchurch and our water is their number one priority and I still believe that because we 're blessed with that would pure groundwater not everyone has the opportunity to have ground water to drink a lot of places have to drink surface water which is far riskier and sometimes recycling treated water so we ask thee sure and also we 're special because we have the expertise in the world to demonstrate the safety of our drinking water and pun and to their tomb public ownership what does that really mean and what are the risks that belie that so Christchurch in this council I believe is ready to stand firm and protect our pure resource of our deep aquifer drinking water and to be able to access that and it 's pure state untreated and it is frustrating for us waiting for the government reports and announcements and requirements and it is having them picked on our own planning however wait while much again and communed Helen and who team for managing this and to plan and do at the same time in ensuring that the money we 're spending as well and to address Erin 's Ashura very high water consumption we do have to remind ourselves that we are the garden city and we do make a lot of beer and we do drink more beer some of it is why we do use more water in the summer so the conservation cool for residents will be a very interesting one if it 's gardeners they need to start now by looking at mulching so you on to that pronto so I 'll also be supporting the additional amendment thank you so I 've got Sara Aaron and Phil Sara thank you it 's unacceptable that our water supply would be amalgamated with other regions and disingenuous too so it will be publicly owned when it 's clear that it wouldn 't be democratically governed but right here right now in Christchurch I have a real issue with the amount of money in to time and staff resources being spent on the the tempra coronation for such a short timeframe when it 's clear that there 's been no public measurable public health benefit for there and when those many millions of dollars could have been spent and steered in that time and energy focused on actually repairing the infrastructure that needed us to start with I think that 's and would have been a much better place for our time and energy and staff resources in rate payers money to be spent would have been getting interest rate into that work rather than spending months looking at how to temporary chlorinate when much of it time we need to keep the chlorine out of our water there has been no increased public health risk nothing had changed we need to spend that money on getting our infrastructure up to standard not just good enough to get rid of the chlorine that we needed it to be good enough to meet any new standards that the government has and there includes a reticulated system which is a key component here lock north was not about well heeds it was about the aquifer and we completely overreact in a room and then Phil Allen who obviously like to thank and congratulate the Crusaders for winning on the weekend even though they were drinking chlorinated water just to clarify one thing a year beer takes 61 to 180 liters of water to make one liter of beer so that could mean that everyone in Christ it 's just drinking approximately 5 litres of beer a day in summer just saying that 's Ireland I just want to raise one point based on the addition that 's been made and there is around the minister that is leading the controlling authority for water across the whole country so not a great model and in my book and they 've chlorinate across the whole country and England so not the best model to look at I 'd be a lot happier if she went to the Netherlands and then finally just that people should get a vote if there is going to be permanent chlorination any parts in New Zealand that don 't already have it the people the public in those areas should get to vote otherwise there is no mandate to permanently chlorinate their water I believe in the democracy is such a massive change to our country in our way of life especially in this city that the people should get a vote not a consultation thank you I think thank you and I 'm gonna support the amendments the additional recommendations there I think it is important to send a signal to the DIA into government and in fact you know I can 't a future company approach just isn 't on clearly that there is an indication about that it could be remain public ownership there it doesn 't mean that something that might would in public ownership in the future where whether an amalgamated Authority wouldn 't be would not be privatized later on by another government so however I think that the important parts to this report that the developing information which we have received in terms of the other of the different treatments that are going to be available and that 's what 's been really valuable for us is a council and we 're going to get further advice to around some of the other treatments and I can tell you that are all being certainly very interested as I indicated to look at the ultraviolet treatment and how effective and cost-effective that will be I think it 's clear from this report that unfed be up chlorine isn 't the only tool in the toolbox it 's one barrier it isn 't totally effective and so we are going to have to look at other other options and they will come to us so I think it is fear at the stage fled that era era position future water companies were in fact our council currently paying a huge amount of other I think if a capital project funding is for people in the deal thank you very much support Vicky 's amendment I think it 's a very good addition but first of all I 'd like to thank Helen and Dave and their team for the work that they 've done this report but um I guess that the key thing here is this city has been delivering clean drinking water to its residents well before we were required to add chlorine and change the well here to do other things to that so I do want to congratulate our team and our staff for doing it for many many years wealth regards to the the slide showed that was the three waters review which was a New Zealand government and an internal fears on page 28 requires answering some tough questions these some of these Christians how do we ensure communities and visitors and had access to safe and affordable drinking water we were actually doing that before we were lumbered with the cost of chlorination how aspirations for fresh water again we were doing that you could argue that it 's been expensive it 's over a third of their rights go into the three waters but water is absolutely crucial the other part of that question how do we meet national directions well it 's costing our ratepayers a fortune at the moment but they are very two very different things how do we meet increasing community expectations relating to drinking water well the expectation of drinking water from our ratepayers was its clean and safe and obviously drinkable we were meeting those we 've been meeting those for many many years and our staffs testing regime as well and truly above what was required by the national standard leading into this so how do we how can you raise an expectation when it is a really simple expectation of clean and safe drinking water the other question how can community how can communities with small or declining rights-based fund renew renewals of aging infrastructure and this is around drinking water that 's not a question for the rate payers of Christchurch who are being moment there is a question that those communities must ask their elected members and their officials and being government that 's not a Christian for the great powers of prostitution so as I said I will be absolutely supporting this and I hope this is going to see their very clear message to those an eternal affairs and the government thank you okay and finally coming to mic thank you well I voted against a chlorinated our water back in generally I 'd like to acknowledge the work the staff has done to try and get the get our water better been untreated as as quickly as possible you know it 's not surprising but it is I guess disappointing to hear that there 's actually been no public health benefit from the temporary chlorination of our drinking water and it has come at great expense at a time where you know we see what 's happening with central government we 're there they are hidden all our money needs to be put in to our drinking water infrastructure to make sure that we do get an exemption you know what 's happening centrally I mean those bells are getting louder and louder it 's absolutely shocking to see the prospect that the ratepayers of Christchurch may have to start being responsible for other regions around self-aligned South Island it 's absolutely abhorrent and I will oppose it and I support this resolution thank you Yanni 's indicated that he 'd like to speak to this as well yawning yeah absolutely and I just had a question for the mover and the second day just based I really strongly support the amendment whether we should be also directing this to the mural forum and to New Zealand and I just wondered whether we could include those two parties to it so would you start in some wording light reflects that yep thank you I 'll just talk to the amendment and the substantive at the same time Viki seconded by D on the whole lot so I 'm just going to put it as one motion so just in regards to and it 's one resolution but the amendment that was put forward as part of that I do think others have said this has been a response to the Havelock North inquiry and in some ways it has felt like it 's been forced on us but I think one of the points that the mayor made in the previous debate which I had a lot of that they thought was the fact that because we made the decision to put chlorine temporarily into our water we are the ones that now have the decision about when we wish to remove it and I think that 's a really important point if we 've been forced to do it by the medical officer of Health then that would have as I understand it being largely out of our control and we could have been facing possibly a lot longer timeframe for when we get to make that get to remove chlorine in our water so I think you know number of cancers have referred to in the debate that this was forced on us I think actually we did make the decision ourselves based on you know it was a pretty limited choice but the medical officer Health had didn 't make that decision I think there has been some advantages to us making that decision and that we get to control when we remove chlorine from our water and and then we see possibly what the consequences are in regards to the amendment it 's really important that although there 's been a lot of reference to have a North inquiry this started well before then there is a move newzealand to basically do the same thing to water that was done to electricity in fact the local government his own funding review discussion document believe it was from 2015 and I quote says that basically examples in the zone of world of waste water and waste management being provided under corporate the corporate structures but these institutional structures have not been adopted uniformly across councils it goes on to say that they believe that poverty chilling models mean there 's a clear separation between policy and regulatory functions in service delivery and that that model contrasts with the more traditional models of service delivery within local authorities which tend to compromise the effective services or to insufficient accountability and then it goes on to say that the gains for clear accountability for service delivery and performance of the Utah it drives cost savings and improvements in service quality and that those gains have been extensively documented following the corporatization of the former electricity departments in power boards so what we can see is from 2015 and I think even earlier there 's a move to privatize and corporatize water supply it 's a gold rush and I think what 's playing out in terms of Havelock model has been that 's really served as ammunition to further that they 're aggressive charge towards privatizing and corporate izing our water and for anyone to think that the electricity reforms are that any benefit for local people local consumers you when we 've seen costs go through the roof we 've seen huge chief executive pay packets on what is effectively monopolies delivering a basic service to people that should be a fundamental right so I think we should be really concerned and we need to make sure and be as proactive as possible in making our opposition to in the stuff for the work they 've done around the well heads and the in the pump stations but you know I do think we 're missing the big strategic piece of work around what we do in terms of water supply we have a water supply strategy we 're the conservation programs were supposed to be part of that I 'm not sure that they 've really been funded adequately they seem to be a soft touch in terms of the budget cuts and so what we see through the LTP and the annual plan is that you know water conservation measures are not adopted in terms of our strategy because it 's something that is not seen as a budget priority now we 're in a situation where we 're having to go back and really start ramping up those sorts of campaigns again and personally I think we need to review that water supply strategy the fact that we haven 't reviewed it in ten years I think is a concern particularly post-earthquake where we want to have a greater resilience in our communities so I it 's not it 's not a pleasant position for us to be in as a city but the sooner we progress the sooner we can take whoring out of our work thank you thank you coronation is that it was a proactive move from Council we only did it because we had the medical officer of Health breathing down our necks we didn 't have a concern about the water supply it was a strategic decision knowing that if we did this for 12 months we could address any particular well heads that were of concern but we were very clear we were only gonna do this for 12 months and I think the one thing missing in this report is that fact there 's an assumption AG that we may continue the chlorination beyond 12 months I certainly don 't have that in the conversation and not just assume we 're going to move to conservation or switching off different pump stations it 's good work to be doing you know the well heads do need to be the best they can be and it 's difficult to back here the Robertson report so it 's difficult to know what the situation was that led to some of these issues so I support the work that is being done but I do want to make clear that I don 't support chlorination the water supply passed next January in terms of the amendment I 'm pretty agnostic about that that 's you know I prefer to see a proposal before I make a decision on it but I 'm happy to support it today so just to wrap up I mean I certainly like to thank staff for what 's a very detailed report and what clearly is a very large volume of work that some of that 's going on to lead to the outcomes that we talked about this morning maximizing the delivery of untreated water it 's great to see the amount of chlorine in the water being reduced and the amount of on chlorinated water coming into the network also been reduced and planned to be further reduced listening to numbers it 's clear that this is a major and program of work and that you possibly can to look at different ways of speeding up the the work program with a clear focus on reducing and then removing the chlorine from the water supply as soon as possible I guess these are exactly the conversations that we hope to be having looking at all of the different ways that we could look at reducing and removing chlorine and I 'd reiterate the point that 's been made the original council resolution allows for chlorination of the water for 12 months I 'm pretty confident that we would not be looking at extending that 12-month chlorination period I certainly my view is the chlorine was in there for 12 months we do what we need to do within the 12 months and then the chlorine comes out I 'm reasonably confident that that would be the view that we would take at that time and therefore that 's the context in which we 're we 're working but we certainly look forward to the upcoming reports which have been signaled and this morning the UV treatment is certainly an area of interest and could to all of this and again it 's good that you 're you 're looking at all different ways of dealing with this not just going straight to continued chlorination as the way that we we need to deal with now only additional resolutions that have been put by Vicky seconded by Dion ownership of the water supply is something that has been talked about you know broadly for some time and yannis made the point that this conversation really predates have a lot north and wrapping water up in a CCO or some other body which isn 't necessarily governed by democratically elected people current government has got a commitment than water supply under whatever model would remain in public ownership but of course once you 've created a CCO or some other vehicle it 's very easy under a different set of policies from a government which may not share that view for that CCO then to be subject to privatization which would then see control of the the water supply further removed from the people and of course ownership of water is something that I imagine would particularly in New Zealand with the the particular constitutional arrangements the treaty why can Waitangi and so on that we 've got here we 're very familiar as a as a territorial authority of what the cost of assuming the the networks and the the infrastructure of a small rural Authority or small rural authorities would look like there 's significant contribution from Christchurch City Council in to wastewater schemes in particular at the moment on Banks Peninsula and like a number of other small rural authorities who have either chosen to under invest or probably more likely haven 't had the ability because of small populations to adequately invest in those water supply wastewater stormwater infrastructures the the city as a whole with banks peninsula included of course is now bearing the cost of wastewater improvements for lyttelton harbour wastewater improvements for a koala harbour and I think it would be untenable for the people of the city to be expected to pay for those sort of infrastructure improvements across the whole of the north of the South Island or the whole of Canterbury or whatever it may be have been put as a result of the discussions that we 've had today we we 're in a position where we 've got some significant expenses of sitting in dealing with what we need to do ourselves to look after our own residents within Christchurch City and Banks Peninsula to have a further burden put onto us because of needing to look to support other rural authorities with small populations and and the lack of ability to pay for what we know is expensive infrastructure certainly isn 't something that I would support so I 'm certainly pleased to support all of these resolutions today so I 'll put the all right so I will now put the motion all those in favor please say aye only against that 's carried thank you and thanks to staff for detailed answers to questions in the detail report will now break for morning to 30 we will come back as in 1140 so it will take just 10 minutes and when I intend to do is to pick up the pace of the meeting from there you I 'm keying to if we can grab some people so that we 've got a quorum we 'll be good okay so we 'll call the meeting back to order next times we 've got three sets of minutes items five six and twelve I 'm happy to move those minutes do I have a second before name Jamie goth all those in favor please say re against that carried now moving to item seven transfer of funding to vbase limited this came through the finance and performance committee meeting Tim you 're conflicted we 'll let you know when we 've finished and Raph if you 'd like to introduce this item plate the direct insurance proceeds and funds to do the repair to date an equity transfer rather than debt funding it 's just much more tax efficient right thank you very much okay okay so Raph you want me to move this yep deal and have a second all right no questions all those in favor say aye aye against so Erin voting against and that 's carried thank you next we move to the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee administered changes to Central City one-way_,_8941.579 streets Pauline if you 'd like to make some comment on this administrator changes to one-way streets the committee and humanity creature we can mean that these changes basically materialized the future there 's a decision to revisit these all right um Dion you have it second no okay so do we have a seconder Tim all right Dion you 've got a question specifically on to them in litchfield street actually I 'll bus up a little bit this is changing the transport chapter of the crust recent recovery plan the accessible City chapter is it effectively what these changes are going to do so would that think what these would these changes make be in conflict with the accessible city chapter and that Central City recovery plan and I mean we know that Litchfield Street and Chum Street will happen at some stage soon because we put the money in the budget to start the stadium or the multi-purpose arena and that effectively goes over top of Litchfield Street so why is the purpose of doing this now when we know that Street which will change children Street in the future anyway okay if that 's if that 's the case to M Street in Litchfield Street especially intersection or especially that the merge of the two way into sorry the one they your the one way into the two-way park on Chum Street and especially the Madras Street Litchfield Street intersection both heading east are quite messy intersections in the Central City so if we 're going to be amending these bylaws and putting them back to what they effectively were are we going to be looking up looking at tidying up those intersections from a safety perspective because that intersection of addresses which filled streets not effect not very safe and the Bob onto M Street between Barbados and Fitzgerald that merge lane is not very safe as well because you often see people tuning into the Mediterranean using that and the dog Neely and I 've seen quite often personally quite a lot of near near accidents there so just wondering if we 're going to be doing there so we 're going to be looking at addressing the those areas some of the issues around them address solution so there is some assurance that if we 're going to be approving this that those things will happen Thank You Glen thank you just curious I know the option one says no financial implications are set free and you 've seen in the report no costs given no you know works my question though is surely there must have been a cost somewhere in terms of at least opportunity cost or something and I know those these are future changes that was signal when Sara revoked the Bible at the time but surely there must have been a cost okay so their cost was just about creating the bylaw so there 's no physical they might have been a staff time cause we got an actual figure on if I could just comment we have a standard clause in their reports where we assign two hundred and fifty dollars for preparation Mike also ate the most it was 15 sorry it was probably 250 dollars at most thank you so this has been moved and seconded is there any in favor say aye against that 's carried thank you okay south frame language item 9 Pauline have you got some comments on this one it 's concerning the layout of the six new lane ways that are renamed in the report there 'll be shear zones operating under a 10k speed limit which brings with it a sheared silence was its own restricted parking rules in council today is required to give legal effect to the revised traffic controls report states that community consultation and engagement has taken place by takara and they 've stated that the feedback was generally positive with most property owners acknowledging the benefits of opening up these blocks and to a new public realm so the previous recommendation shows consistency also with our streets in spaces design guide and the CC RP Medellin allow for any required enforcement once the appropriate signage has been installed okay so moved by Pauline seconded by Mike are there any questions on this yes just one injury yep go ahead right just in regards to the report it makes reference in the number of places and also it cycling activity and priority and I just wondered whether we have any safety order around the ability for people to cycle through these lane ways because it would seem to me that they 're not the sort of places we would have be encouraging cycling activity and I just yeah I just wanted to check we really want people cycling through yes language and including their connections to the adjacent streets that 's primarily two of manasseh streets to the north and south of this area all of those those lane ways of the development of the designs have been safety audited at the various stages the whole principle of the design of them is to enable shared space between cyclists pedestrians and legitimate servicing vehicles which we expect there to be there for a limited amount of time in order service the mixed-use developments within it the the signage supports that and so the whole principle of the thing is to actually enable pedestrians to access that area to access those premises and to do so in a safe manner and just restrictions will apply to the cyclists as through the design of the lane ways themselves those parts of the we 're not expecting vehicle traffic to be there effectively it is very difficult for motorized vehicle to enter those the remaining loan ways that are primarily before council this morning the design of them lends itself to a low speed our hope would be that that is broadly a very self-explaining and therefore self-enforcing lower speed environment but the resolutions before council this morning would enable council officers to enforce and just the final christian i understand there 's been some concern with the eastern frame and just i don 't know whether there 's been any feedback or safety auditing of the pathways through there but just the combination of cycling pedestrian cars has is there is any ongoing program of just monitoring the design in ensuring that if there are any safety things that they 're addressed yes absolutely through you mr. chairman most of these schemes are subject to post construction safety audits the laneways network in the central city is new road users are beginning getting used to that environment now and so need for us to continue to monitor them as far as the east frame is concerned some of those laying waste through these frame and not yet complete at the present time so you 'll still see some bollards there at the moment while some of those sections Elaine wait continue to be invested by illegal Road and so yeah we will continue to monitor those particularly from the point of view of safety thank you so Sara and then back to DeLand Sara you 're alright deal question on this one is the example that 's happened outside the terraces we did use that shared zone sign with the cars and if we ended up having just cars cars cars cars and driving down casual street and it was they didn 't really work that well and now we 've just taken that sign down and put the just authorized vehicles only sign there are these are we going well what mitigations have been done to avoid wet running is my big question here between term street and saying it 's for people to avoid the main artery or of the nature of the fact that any driver coming through there should be expecting to meet pedestrians cyclists and in increasing numbers as those developments take place there generally it will be an unattractive shortcut for motorists through those lane ways it 's not going to be made easy for them to drive through there the the reason we 're permitting vehicles in there is servicing to the premises but with what we will be doing in monitoring the usages I 've just said is if we we believe begin to believe that vehicles are rat running through there then we would have some ability to begin to look at the design the placement of speed so are there any ways we can here because obviously we don 't want of cars just driving through them just for the sake of cars driving through there Rhett run between CMS extreme film Street which which is already happening I 've seen the police do it even I 'm outside the justice and emergency precinct so how can we do any signage that we can use to say actually we just than just cars those are the resolutions before Council this morning but the science doesn 't servicing vehicles and that is pretty much exists on Oxford Terrace which he referred to the resolutions before Council this morning and naval counseling and so yes there would be further tools then we could come back to Council as a result of that monitoring and recommend to move further traffic resolutions if we deemed to them to be necessary I hope thank you the response is also bear in mind that the laneway network has been developed under the South frame planning framework understand is and so the these are just merely the the traffic measures to enable us to enforce that so the general response has been thank you okay so this has been moved in second is there any debate on this I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye against that 's carried thank you and then the next one item 10 the July 2017 Christchurch post event flood post event report and again Pauline introduction of the report is a patek so take it as reason the main points is that overall the EOC response was believed to have gone well and they say that patience were good noting that there is a key opportunity to identify and train through the staff to fulfill key IOC functions noting also that some increased resourcing is required 4.5 for some actions taken to prevent sewage overflows resulting from a detailed week with a plan these consist of deploying of over pumps prior to an event a deploying of sucker trucks during an event use of signage advising people if there is an overflow and prompt responses to calls from the community our 4.8 preventing River flood water from entering the wastewater network actions include installation of vent plugs that vented manholes installation of men whole flood trays and installation of pea non-return valves there stopping the water bed flow I think the report is good it 's got attached nets which identify the properties that were affected by the flooding they identified nine personnel who were part of the EOC Center and they in the table attached noting issues the actions and the outcomes I think this is note some of the well identified I want to say shortcomings but perhaps some areas we they could be some attention for a future event but if we don 't do these reports and identify those we can 't learn from them and grow so we 're basically just receiving this report today thank you thank you are there any questions on this okay we don 't have staff here at the moment so what I propose we do is we get staff to join us will leapfrog to the next item which is the banks peninsula of the pest-free banks producing a memorandum of understanding and then when the staff do come into the room for this one we 'll pick this one up and ask questions on it and complete this item so while we 're waiting for the staff to arrive let us now move forward joint amid eleven pest-free banks penciller MOU and we do have deaf here for this that 's great so maybe if you 'd like to make some intro this came through your committee Pauline as well so the Regional Council dr. ends with my trip City Council and the purpose of the memorandum reads ensuring banks permit thanks Peninsula to pitaka or raka how to is effectively free of piste animals so the indigenous biodiversity is thriving and becoming more widespread across the peninsula end unto Christ future city I 'm the see mo you is not legally binding does not commit Council to provide any funding I 'd like to congratulate the community for endorsing this MOU and also to all the parties for sharing a theological vision great thank you thanks building is there any comment from staff on this one excellent that 's great all right so are there any questions so can I have a mover for this guy now what we 're suggesting is that counsel asked Andrew it 'd be the other person that signed this so we 've got myself and counsel ask Andrew it 's a sign so can I have a mover for this Pauline seconded by Mike all those in favor against that 's carried great thank you so now we 've got the staff here for the flood post event number 13 the draft submission on the proposed national planning standards okay and I will invite staff to speak to this report before we consider finding standards but that we oppose certain aspects additional thank you are there any questions on this okay so do I have op fell but just what thank you for this was clearly it 's important to get this right and maybe it 's because it 's a while since I was across the district P know it was a wee bit confusing I 'm just wondering we satisfied a route around any in any sort of changes regarding intensification because give it given some of the problems we discussed at the time of the district plane and given that we in the future a lot of us would like to see some changes to the Ellison so the draft planning standards don 't specifically prescribed content other than definitions so for the most part the capsule would be able to use those definitions in contexts in different ways so it could still determine what 's the appropriate density for different zones but the funding that the council can create zones and I don 't think the intention of the standards is to prescribe one of the commissioners also that thank you any further questions okay so I 'm happy to move this do I have a seconder I 'm Tim thank you any debate all those in favor please say aye against that carried thank you very much yep we will wait for the staff to arrive and so we think there might be one maybe five minutes away okay so we 're just waiting for the staff to arrive to answer questions on the flood post-event report paper as soon as they arrive we 'll continue with that item and then we 've got the one public excluded item to deal with after that so why don 't we just take literally five minutes in the anticipation that staff will have arrived by that time so if we are back here at 15 when we 'd expect to have staff in the room so that we can complete item 10 and then we 'll move into the public excluded item you the meeting post event Christchurch flood post event report now Rebecca welcome to the table that 's great before we get you to start answering from some questions I just want to check that we still got Yanni with us Yanni are you still there okay all right great you 're with us now that 's good so now let 's move into questions then on item 10 so starting with Glenn Glenn you had a question looks like some statements that perhaps quite joining up and also to get a sense of perspective over events so if you want to offer that as well at some point over the number of cars etcetera that would be good and on that note okay I 'm going to flip between the first page of the report and page 1 2 1 because in the beginning of the report it talks about generally that the response from a CDM event went quite well and then it follows up with 68 corrective actions so are you able to provide some perspective over there I 've got some other questions after that you know over whether a lot to me I can speak quite generally on this matter the number of we are heavily invested in developing the correction corrective action process it 's something that is extremely important and we obtain feedback from a range of people including those and so the corrective action process is one that is quite nuanced in terms of the issues that are raised and those are addressed but one of the key pieces of work that we 're currently looking at is consolidating the corrective actions from across the emergencies that we 've we 've managed so there are key things that keep coming up that we currently addressing so for example Josi rostering is a common thing so it 's a piece of work that is critical to us it 's extremely important that all those corrective actions are documented a couple of more questions thank you for that just page one one nine number sixty it talks about the event being a client quote okay earlier on it says the event was a small event isn 't that rather understating though the event given the effect on made between the size of the event and the impact on community and certainly the wording of that is is certainly not intended to detract from the impact of community that is it 's certainly first and foremost in our mind you know whether it 's one home that is impacted or multiple homes I think in terms of proportionality and scale of our emergency response that wording is probably considered in the light of other activations and specifically those of the size of the Canterbury earthquakes for example and thank you my final question there 's relates to niwa that 's page that 's 106 in our big agendas it might be 38 in your report and it 's about it 's the corrective action number 13 where it says there is currently no access to advanced storm surge forecasts and then it talks about knee were in the outcome column but my understanding is knee were actually didn 't advise us of the storm surges that because they 're edited significant and now that took South Shore by surprise they 're responsible for forecasting all of the factors is they didn 't advise on the search part which needed a fever okay thanks thank you Pauline I 'm just wondering these events when we talk about one of the loonies might be the identified needs as for the resourcing does there anything in training for people to to be trained in civil defense so if they 're actually implied that we could since she 's arrived but at this point of this event was July last year we didn 't have a large number of people in the series of the it 's about looking at international best practice and how we can learn from that in terms of things like ELC rostrum for example you see rostering practice and all the initiatives that be training or EMC readiness I think you know we recognize that there have been a lot of council staff that have been involved in a number of activations we recognize the toll that has often on people personally involved in people 's participation and so everything that we 're doing currently is around putting people in people 's welfare first whether that 's high-quality training and robust Wellspring processes is critical to avoid people from burning out whole staff welfare issue we couldn 't do what we do without good quality trained council staff appreciate their efforts so it 's a combination if we do need a good trained skilled staff in the air but you 've got more of those thing to reduce the number of hours that they do I know that people are doing you know days and days and breathing them to sleep and the staff members who already have an incredible workload week by week here so we could see that 's not sustainable and it 's something that we 've recognized very early on and we need to look after each other and look after our people it 's as simple as that by the regional carry seating team is they can retain in team so does the response team of ten people that have been trained up in May and there 's another team going through who could be called upon by that territory thoroughly it 's got a response to bring some skills hit certain just to give some advice it 's important help through particularly those first that first seven days of a lengthy response so that you can actually manage people 's welfare with that play they 're around supporting the resourcing we it 's and this was one of the things go better and we look after communities such as since Peter Thank You Phil thank you because this is a huge amount of work and I raised this at the committee tober this one make sure it does happen there 's a number I 'm just sure thank you thank you Tim thank you I just really want to thank you for the work you 're doing and I think that you know it 's about continued improvement and you 've pointed out about the numbers of people required and they 're lifting you know it just doesn 't happen overnight and it 's nothing worse than giving people that are not given which is even more dangerous so I just really want to thank the three of you and all those behind you that have done this and it 's well entering yeah sure Jana go ahead oh cool um thank you I 've sent through some questions in regards to this report and I first off just I did want to think staff for doing the report I personally think it 's it 's great that we 're looking at these events and evaluating what 's worked and what hasn 't worked I don 't have comes some concern that the report a bit similar to council Livingston 's questions at the start in that this seemed to be something go wrong on the Friday and I don 't see sort of reference to that I known some of the corrective actions there seems to be reference to getting greater collaboration between the contractor and Intel but just to give you one example there was heavy equipment sent in to Clarendon terrorists that shouldn 't have been there and the people driving the truck it was quite weird to think that they would go into an area where they didn 't they weren 't safe being in so I just wanted to kind of check through the corrective action what we would do differently if you like in terms of that there was a mess of city kid truck that was sent in on Friday to I think clear the drains suck the water out and the flooding was already at such an extent that it was quite hazardous and you also had local residents who were trapped without any sort of mechanism to deal with it I personally rang the call center and there seemed to be a gap at the call center as well so again I don 't_''_11641.54 I don 't wanna be we had response teams and quite this is the same event so what happened was along the if and it 's really great to get the map of the properties that were affected I also sent through to the comms team when the initial calm down that there being no reference to this area and as you 've seen from the map that was the area that was most affected and yet none of the comms going out at the start of the event referenced this area and what people should what we the same event there was flooding I think it was about through three o 'clock to four o 'clock in the afternoon that got quite bad and actually prevented people from being able to get out of their houses safely the response seems I think went out about six seven o 'clock at night so there was a kind of three-hour period where there was a lot of confusion over our response and again like I think you know again there 's a lot of corrective actions that you 've identified so I was just a bit surprised to see the international introduction about things going really well without reference to kind of the initial kind of confusion that seemed to appear on the friday from my experience you 've referred to I understand so there 's the issue of response times visiting homes and residents on a door-to-door basis we were certainly unaware of any conversation that might have taken place regarding this but I should add that it 's something that we proactively use the response teams in our response to cyclone Gaeta a more recent event and so I think that pre-warning of residents through the deployment of the response teams is something that we 've you know we find to be highly effective from an emergency management point of view we 've also had into future plans secondly if I may just address the issue of public information more broadly we 're doing and continue to work very closely with the public information management team or the pentanes as its referred to and this again in processes which are currently in constantly being improved on thanks to the work of the media team and our collaboration with them so we recognized very much that that communication very early on in the piece is absolutely essential not just even you know one civil defense have been activated but once you know city services are involved essentially as part of their business as usual ' processes and that public information management is a critical part of of all of those processes and it 's something that we 're we 're certainly strengthening and feeding that into our decision making process the land drainage team have also been doing _''_11851.261 so for surface water flooding etc and their response to that and again that 's another area there 's been a lot of public looking at with city services know this guy and as you referenced I think we did do some pre notification every one of the more recent events which you know I just really commend you for picking up on that that 's something that I 'd put forward previously and I think it 's really positive I 'm happy to take up the communications stuff off offline if you can see the emails that I sent through around the July event and I think there 's some some gaps so happy to address that but the final two questions I had was there 's a flood defense fund has that in the report the target date was 30th of June 2018 at the public land drainage of meetings one of the issues of cleanup arose and the feed that we had from the July event is that the cleanup went really well but Ana donal feedback from those land drainage meetings was people were quite unhappy before so the flood Defense Fund is that set up now up how are we able to access it and you know it could assist with things like cleanup would get the feedback into it through the committee and it has been a long process but this is a better way to do it because we actually and just the final question was the the thing the thing that I can 't see in the corrective actions and I may have messed up this this quite a few but we don 't appear to have local flooding response plans for each area and so you know the response tends to be quite high level and I just wondered whether in terms of community engagement whether there 's any program in place to develop local flooding response plans with local communities so in each area of the city obviously there 'll be different things but for example you know along the the places in the health care in my ward one of the issues that was really clear was that people were not prepared to wade through storm water that had didn 't have proper clothing they they had children there you know it was a risk so I just wondered whether things like you know the Defense Fund I think it 's more strategic planning without intel alien drainage community around what the best thing to do when you will have seen in the LTP just came to counsel for the LTP discussions there is a level of super surround right so in terms of the heath care which as you can see from the map was really badly impacted is there a kind of prioritization around where we 'll get those fund response plans put in place first as a priority the community 's readiness to participate in this so we can certainly seem to the team its team can send you information about them okay yeah I just again um you know this has been going on since 2014 and in that time we 've seen huge community impact particularly along certain places in the earth Kurt and I 'm just really concerned that we get on top of this as soon as possible given that it has work that you 're doing I really appreciate the corrective actions and the review I think it 's excellent thank you thank you and though any further questions all right so Pauline you 're having to move this do we have a seconder like Davidson is there any debate things you act in this role when an event comes our way we 've all read the report we 're grateful for everything done I just think in the executive summary though you 've been a bit kind taniwha who didn 't advise over the search which added is it says four hundred mils which is a significant amount in talk communities such as well South Shore by surprise and we 're grateful for the staff there who came to the rescue we take sea level rise seriously as one component part of the overall effect when you get you know it was here as well some I think it 's important we actually do call out these communication breakdowns we 're headed over the coda tsunami situation with civil defense in Wellington 's so yeah I think it 's really thank you and yeah thanks for coming on to answer these questions this morning thanks for work done to put this report together it 's great that it 's such a comprehensive report it 's great that it 's identified some areas for improvement and of course we 've heard this morning that there 's already work underway to to implement some of that so excellent thank you very much indeed so I 've put the motion all those in favor say aye against that 's carried thank you so now that we resolve to so now I move that we exclude the public as set out on pages two ninety and two ninety one of the agenda have a second before this duel swigs all those in favor all right say hi against let 's carry you _"

and certainly the wording of that is is certainly not intended to detract from the impact of community that is it 's certainly first and foremost in our mind you know whether it 's one home impacted or multiple homes I think in terms of proportionality and scale of our emergency response that wording is probably considered in the light of other activations and specifically those of the size of the Canterbury earthquakes for example and thank you my final question there 's relates to niwa that 's page that 's 106 in our big agendas it might be 38 in your report and it 's about it 's the corrective action number 13 where it says there is currently no access to advanced storm surge forecasts and then it talks about knee were in the outcome column but my understanding is knee were actually didn 't advise us of the storm surges there because they added a significant amount it took kind to Tunis with you they they 're responsible for forecasting all of the factors that will go into a certain event but my understanding is they didn 't advise on the search part which needed a theater okay okay thanks Thank You Pauline I 'm just wondering when we talk about one of the unis might be needs as for the resourcing does it anything in training for people to be trained in southern defense so but then actually imply that week she 's done since July last year we I think you know we recognize that there have been a lot of council staff that have been involved in a number of activations recognize the toll that has often on people and so everything that we 're doing is around putting people in people 's well first that 's ensuring that council staff have access to [Music] you 've got a response to bring some skill suits you might be lacking some advice important help through particularly those first seven days of a lengthy response so that you can actually manage people 's around supporting the resourcing Thank of work and I raise this at the committee too but this one make sure it does happen there 's a number of areas we 're in fact the outcomes and haven 't_''_632.65 been finished like in summers around the messaging either I 'm just wanting to make sure that given all the work that these parts would still be completed there are common things and certainly in future for future reports we will be thank you thank you I just really want to thank you for the work you 're doing and I think that you know it 's about continued improvement and you 've pointed out about the numbers of people required and they 're lifting you know it just doesn 't happen overnight and it 's nothing worse than giving people that are not skilled given which is even more dangerous so I just really want to thank the three of you and all those behind you that have done this and and that 's continually working on improving so Cheers I think question as well injury yeah sure yeah knee go ahead um thank you I and I first off just I did want to thank staff for doing the report I personally think it 's it 's great that we 're looking at these events and evaluating what 's worked and what hasn 't worked I don 't have comes some concern that the report a bit similar to council Livingston 's questions at the start in that this seemed to be something going wrong on the Friday and I don 't see sort of reference to that I know some of the corrective actions there seems to be reference to getting greater collaboration between the contractor and Intel but just to give you one example there was heavy equipment sent into Clarendon terrorists that shouldn 't have been there and the people driving the truck it was quite weird to think that they would go into an area where they did they weren 't safe being in so I just wanted to kind of check through the corrective action what 's proposed in regards to that that what we would do differently if you like in terms of that just so there was a Friday to I think clear the drains suck the water out and the flooding was already at such an extent that it was quite hazardous and he also had local residents who were trapped without any sort of mechanism to deal with it I personally rang the call center and this seemed to be a gap at the call center as well so again I don 't so what happened was along the if it 's really great to get the map of the properties that were affected I also sent through to the comms team when the initial comms that there being no reference to this area and as you 've seen from the map that was the area that was most affected and yet none of the comms going out at the start of the event referenced this area and what people should what we were doing or what people should do but it is the same event there was flooding I think it was about through 3 o 'clock to four o 'clock in the afternoon that got quite bad and actually prevented people from being able I think went out about six seven o 'clock at night so there was a kind of three-hour period where there was a lot confusion over our response and again I think you know again there 's a lot of corrective actions that you 've identified so I was just a bit surprised to see the International introduction about things going really well without reference to kind of the initial kind of confusion that seemed to appear on the Friday from my experience I understand we were certainly aware of any conversation that might have taken place regarding this but it 's something that we proactively use the response teams in our response to cyclone Gaeta a more recent event and that worked well and has been incorporated into future plans so I think that pre-warning of residents through the deployment of the response teams is something that we 've you know we find to be highly effective from an emergency management point of view we also had into future plans if I may just address the issue of public information more broadly we 're doing and continue to work pentanes as its referred to and this is again in processes which are currently in constantly being improved on thanks to the work of the media team and our collaboration with them so we 've recognized very much that that communication very early on in the piece is absolutely essential not just even you know services are involved their business as usual and it 's something that we have also been doing a lot of work around that and again that 's another area where there 's been a lot of public and as you referenced I think we did do some pre notification every one of the more recent events which you know I just really commend you for picking up on that that 's something that I 'd put forward previously and I think it 's really positive I 'm happy to take up the communications stuff off offline if you can see the emails that I sent through around the July event and I think there 's some some gaps so happy to address that but the final two questions I had was there 's a flood was 30th of June 2018 at the public land drainage meetings one of the issues have cleanup arose and the feed that we had from the July event is that the cleanup went really well but Ana Donal feedback from those land drainage meetings was people were quite unhappy and it hadn 't been as good as the time before so the flood Defense Fund is that set up now I Pete how are we able to access it you know it could assists with things like cleanup get the feedback into it through the committee and it has been a long process but this is a better way to do it because we actually and just the final question was the the thing the thing that I can 't see in the corrective actions and I 'm a mister there 's quite a few but we don 't appear they have local flooding response plans for each area and so you know the response tends to be quite high level and I just wondered whether in terms of community engagement whether there 's any program in place to develop area of the city obviously there 'll be different things but for example you know along the the places and the heath get in my ward one of the issues that was really clear was that people were not prepared to wade through storm water that had surge you know that people didn 't have gumboots people didn 't have proper clothing they they had children there you know it was a risk so I just wondered whether things like you know so don 't think it 's part of the flood I think it 's right so in terms of the heathco which as you can see from the map was really badly impacted is there a kind of prioritization around where we 'll get those fund response plans put in place first as a priority the community 's readiness team can send you information about them okay yeah I just again my um you know there 's been going on since 2014 and in that time we 've seen huge community impact particularly along certain places in the earth Kurt and I 'm just really concerned that we that it has been outstanding for so long but thank you for the work that you 're doing I really appreciate the corrective actions and the review I think it 's excellent thank you thank you and there any further questions all right so Pauline you 're happy to move this do we have a seconder Mike Davidson is there any debate yep thank you yeah and thank you for this I know you know obviously personally a lot of this stuff well of course we 're involved you some of the feeds you act in this role when an event comes our way we 've all read the report we 're grateful for everything done I just think in the executive summary though you 've been a bit quiet taniwha who didn 't advise over the search which added as it says 400 mils which is a significant amount in talk communities such as well South Shore by surprise and we 're grateful for the staff there who came to the rescue we take sea level rise seriously as one component part of the overall effect when you get it 's important we actually do call out these communication breakdowns we 're headed over the koto tsunami situation with civil defense in Wellington so yeah I think it 's really important I take this the scope and the purpose of the report is to look at us but we aren 't disconnected from the outside agencies and the provision of information to you but but thank you for this and all the work you 've done for the staff and all the past events industry in I don 't think people realize it 's a 24-hour operation and it can go on for weeks not just during a long time so that 's really pleasing to see that the sorts thing is gone and this training thank you and yeah thanks for coming in to answer these questions this morning thanks for all the work done to put this report together it 's great that it 's such a comprehensive report it 's great that it 's identified some areas for improvement and of course we 've heard this morning that there 's already work underway to and to indeed so I put the motion all those in favor say aye against that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "okay South frame laneways item nine Pauline have you got some comments on this one it 's consuming the there 'll be shared zones operating under a team case in Council today is required to give legal effect to the revised TripIt controls and they 've stated that the feedback was genuinely positive most property owners acknowledging the benefits of opening up these blocks into a new public realm so the proving this recommendation shows consistency also with our streets and spaces design guide and the CCR P Medellin allow for any required enforcement okay so moved by Pauline seconded by Mike are there any questions on this yes just one yep go ahead right just in regards to the report it makes reference in a number of places and it makes reference to this being done to for pedestrian and also cycling activity and priority and I just wondered whether we have any safety order around the ability for people to cycle through these lane ways because it would seem to me that they 're not the sort of places we would be encouraging cycling activity and I just cycling through yes and including their connections streets to the north and south of this area all of those those lane ways of the development of the designs have been safety audited at the various stages the whole principle of the design of them is to enable shared space between cyclists pedestrians and legitimate servicing vehicles which we expect there to be there for a limited amount of time in order to service the mixed-use developments within it the the signage supports that and so the whole principle of the thing is to actually ins to access that area to access those premises and to do so in a safe manner and just speed restrictions will apply to the cyclists as well yes right and how is that enforced primarily enforced through the design of the lane ways themselves those parts of the lane ways where we 're not expecting vehicle to traffic to be there effectively it is very difficult for motorized vehicle to enter those the remaining lowing ways of the primarily before Council this morning the design of them lends itself to a low speed space environment self-explaining and therefore self-enforcing lower speed environment but the resolutions before council this morning would enable council officers to enforce that speed limit if it was deemed to be necessary and just the final Christian I understand there 's been some concern with the eastern frame and just I don 't know whether there 's been any feedback or safety auditing of the pathways through there but just the combination of cycling pedestrian cars has there is any ongoing program of just monitoring the design in ensuring that if there are any safety things that they 're addressed yes absolutely mr. chairman most of these schemes are subject to post construction safety orders the laneways network in the central city is new beginning getting used to and so with these new lane ways there is there is a need for us to continue to monitor them as far as the east frame is concerned some of those laying waste through these frame and not yet complete at the present time so you 'll still see some bollards there at the moment while some of those sections Elaine wake continue to those particularly from the point of view of safety thank you so Sarah and then back to DeLand Sarah you 're right down in question on this one as is the example that 's happened outside the terraces we did use net sheared zone sign with the cars and if we ended up having just cars cars cars cars and driving down casual street it was they didn 't really work well and now we 've just taken that sign down and put the just authorized vehicles only sign there are these are we going well what mitigations have been done to avoid wet running there 's my big question here between term street and it 's for people to avoid the main arterial or the main roads that is again primarily through the layout of the of the laneway network there because of the 10 kilometer an hour speed limit which will be enforceable within it because of the nature of the fact that any driver coming through there should be expecting to meet pedestrians cyclists and in increasing numbers as those developments take place there generally it will it 's not going to be made easy for them to drive through there the the reason we 're permitting vehicles in there is the legitimate service into the premises with what we will be doing in monitoring the usages I 've just said is if we we believe begin to believe that vehicles are rat running through there then we would have some ability to begin to look at the design the place for this so are there any ways we can act because obviously we don 't want cars just driving through them just for the sake of cars driving through they direct run between centers of strange film street which which is already happening I 've seen the police do it even I 'm outside the justice and emergency precinct so how can we is there any signage that we can use to say actually we just want service vehicles to go in these lane ways rather than just cars those are the resolutions before councils morning but the fines it does make clear for servicing vehicles and that is pretty much the environment that exists on this morning in and and so yes there would be further tools in small council if we thought we need to recommend to you then we could come back to council as a result of that monitoring and recommend to you further traffic resolutions if we deemed to them to be necessary Thank You Jimmy consultation with those key stakeholders twice result first they 're responsible mr. chairman I think in the Auto Road letter the response to most of these resident proposed resolutions and traffic operations they was broadly positive from those directly affected land holders or businesses and so on and of course it 's also important to bear in mind that the laneway network has been developed under the South frame planning framework so those developers and those landowners within that area understand what the purpose of the laneway network is and so these are just merely the the traffic measures to enable us to enforce that so the general response has been broadly positive to be operated thank you okay so this has been moved in second is there any debate on this I 'll put 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "and now let 's move to that supplementary report which is item 17 the water supply program updates so Helen welcome to the table thank you very much indeed for preparing this report and we 'll invite you to speak to it in just a moment I mean this obviously is an update on the resolutions that we passed back in April where we raised a clear expectation that the chlorination of the water supply would be for 12 months any extension of that would require a further council resolution it 's great to have this paper in front of us today showing us the work that you 're doing towards reducing the amount of chlorine in the water supply and obviously turning the chlorine off at certain pump stations and what the program looks like to reduce the amount of chlorine and get more and more on chlorinated water into the network as we go so I 'll hand over to you to speak to the report but thank you very much indeed for providing this detailed information to us today and we 're still exploring other options in from 5% of the supply and we expect to have 24% of the supply without chlorine treatment by the end of August so that 's from the four pump stations out of our 53 the four pump stations that are permanently without chlorine and another seven where we can deliver to winter demand levels by isolating the one below ground wellhead in maximizing the delivery from a secure above-ground well it 's so that 's the reducing chlorine across the city we 've also got the first tranche of major remedial works underway so that 's it another seven pumped stations and some of those over let the ones we 've temporarily isolated so it 's hard to keep track of the numbers but that first tranche of works delivers about 17% of our supply and once those works are completed those those will be permanently without chlorine as well the second tranche of works is some 17 pump stations 49 wells across the city and that 's where the indicative timelines for that work begin in February next year and run out to 2020 so that is where the works where that lines in the paper some things that we 're doing to try and advance those works the first is to get more drilling rigs in specialist contractors on board there may because it really one of the biggest constraints is the number of wells that we can turn off at any one time and that 's where we 've talked about water conservation a second possibility is to do some interim remedial works to some of the below ground well hits that are in quite good condition and get sign-off fellows and defer the major remedial works in the raising of those above ground to further out so two or three years out another possibility is rolling out more ultraviolet treatment so we 'll bring you a paper 23rd of August a council meeting on ultraviolet treatment for maintenance and that remains an option for some of our other larger pump stations around the city and we 'll that and another thing that we 're doing as we 're doing works on the pump stations is we 're we suspect that some of our pump stations could of those wells and maybe that we can deliver more waters from some of our pump stations and by upgrading some of the pumps here so that 's another option the other aspect of the work is the research that we commissioned into international experience and that clearly demonstrates that chlorination is no silver bullet in terms of public safety so the experience in Western Europe and particularly in the Netherlands where 85% of their supplies are without chorong shows that you can get very good public health outcomes they have disease so it 's good to see that it is possible so just reminding you that you will get another report on the 23rd of August those tranche 2 weeks and some real time lines given exploring all of those other aspects to accelerate it thank you very much we look to questions and film Helen thank you very much for your report it 's some very full and clearly backed up with the other reports but I just your point about the chlorination not being a silver bullet and you refer to that in your report so I fact from the report protis our people wouldn 't be protected from the protozoa say I 'm just really wondering why the hemlock North report report supported so much chlorination is sort of like a primary defense is an effective barrier to two bacteria and other pathogens in the water supply it 's just not the only barrier so there are other barriers that can be used in combination and still get those public 's and I guess one of the other ones you 're going to give us more information on in the next report it is the UV Thank You Glenn thank you on the same thing that feels just a report or access to it today what are the main barriers aside from coronation used in those European countries because we know that this is about barriers of which chlorination is one there 's a sense in which we are putting pips New Zealand all the eggs into one basket so the yeah I think the New Zealand the current drinking water standards do talk about a multi-barrier approach and the principle really coming out of the high standard of care and vigilance about any public water supply and then they go on to talk about a multi barrier approach they do regard chlorination is essential within that multi-barrier approach but I think that international experience is that well it is one barrier it 's it 's not necessarily an essential one so in terms of the Dutch approach the the first thing is making sure you 've got very good source water and they favor ground water over Supersport because it 's generally a safer and cleaner water source and indeed that is one of the criterion for a secure borders here is that we have good source water and that we we constantly monitor that and know that it 's good this it then the second part of course is in your head works so having that secure and the works that we 're doing to and then looking through your whole network so ensuring that you maintain and around you will need to work very well indeed and that you have very tight control of any repairs or maintenance or singles so when you 'll very clear that you 're not introducing contamination Thank You Polly chemical treatment should be compared to New Zealand in the rest of the world juice in but we have hitting transgressions and there reticulation yes we 're here so generally at our reservoirs it 's the main place where we have ecoli transgressions no we haven 't_''_545.88 we have and we haven 't had any recorded outbreaks of waterborne disease either from our networks but we do get the occasional ecoli transmission on our network and those rates are higher than experienced Dave Dave in him some may wish to comment on a lot of money on doing that kind of work the transcriptions reported you will see them reported in the quarterly or the to monthly report but normally the low-end week or no we retest 24 hours later and I 've gone so they are a little blood but what a safety plan says we will move very very quickly on even the little blue constantly in the reticulation and they could be where someone 's dug through a reticulation one you 'll always get some you so just to reinforce it minor this creep thank you thank you ref Vicki and then Aaron ref yeah Thank You Helen I refer to item five point four two point five on page 13 where it says since the counter the earthquakes and until December 2017 the cities of some water supply had a provisionally secured status and complied with the drinking water standards without the need for treatment twenty second rule was 2017 the annual compliance report was received from the drinking water Assessor confirming that the Christchurch water supply was compliant with the drinking water standards at that time that changed obviously in December when the director-general issued a loss of secure water status I guess my question is we were quite happy with the water supply at that time the reason is because we 2011 I think we were raising all of our below ground well heads to above ground well heads we very had a very very extensive monitoring program over that quality of water coming out of all of our well heads as well as in the reticulation so we 've got a of our well heads and so we were and you were we were advising and we were putting money into looking after the breakage in our reticulation we were looking at upgrading now well it 's certainly well it 's our reservoirs because of because a lot of our big concrete reservoirs hand correct you actually replace quite a significant amount of them so we were put in our effort our concerns at that time reticulation end and on reservoirs yes and that 's really where we were put in our efforts so we also just going back to the other question we had no concern about the water the quality of water coming out of our well heads and our upgrade program as you said with that report that came from the drinking had been shared with the medical officer of Health so we had an improvement program that incorporated the slow afraid of our well it and that improvement program was agreed by all parties as at the end of June really yeah thank you things change obviously from the second report from have locked off Thank You the 5.44 in terms of the current review of the three water sector being led by the Department of Internal Affairs who I rang this morning just because having read all their data what concerned me was that they were actually putting the cost of drinking water wastewater and stormwater from the small local authorities who face a massive bill on to urban areas so I 'm just wondering in terms of the model then they 've provided of Christchurch being linked with these possibilities do we know anything about the cost of for example two thirds of the South Island in terms of bringing its drinking water wastewater and storm water up to speed and which they would like to put on to the good people of Christchurch cost has been quite a large barrier now there has been some work done by the water managers group that 's gone up to the chief executives group I 'm not sure whether it 's gone on to the mural group looking at the tenebra costs but I can come into that so I hadn 't gone to the mural forum included in each council 's long-term plan not all councils have budgeted for an increased cost over and above their general maintenance so I haven 't even budgeted to get there not look because they don 't know what the standard is gonna be right so it varies across the various councils right okay great thank you Erin yeah thanks thanks now just a little bit of a follow on from Vicky 's point around that regional usage because when we look at the recommendations that have gone to government following heavily up north and like perhaps if we had no concerns about our water supply Pauline that race that no one 's ever been sick from Christchurch 's potable water supply the and it was confirmed by Alistair Humphreys we 're kind of like this feels like throwing the baby out in for the drinking water by putting the whole country in the same basket and when you look at on page a wool 5.4 for the maps the people one of the top half of the South Island or even the one that covers most of Canterbury if lowest common denominator in which case would end up being chlorinated because out and are filled they 're pulling from wells and the day of transgressions all the time or various areas around Canterbury does that then force us into chloride chlorination rather than staying independent drinking the best drinking water in the world and not treating it like other parts of the country so one is the Department of Internal Affairs review of the delivery of three water services across the country and there are there is no doubt that there are problems with the delivery of those services and the quality of those services across the country particularly in small centers so that is one piece of work and then the related piece of work is the Ministry of Health work looking at the response to the level of North inquiry stage to report and its that we that is talking about setting up an independent drinking regulator so it 's a regulator not a delivery model and that that regulator would be the one setting what the drinking water standards would be now I 'm pretty sure risk-based approach and that something is prescriptive as chlorination is likely to be in the context of that risk-based approach so it would depend on what the issues are for each supplier and it wouldn 't it wouldn 't be a blanket requirement to do any one thing for every supplier in the country but currently that is one of the recommendations is to chlorinate the whole country there is a recommendation for mandatory chlorination but they do also discuss the what the threshold should be for any exemptions and if you look at the cabinet paper in response to that inquiry which is we have to look for what the government thinking is they are asking for further advice on that so there they 're not saying okay we 're going to do this tell us how we should do it they 're saying give us further advice on the issue of mandatory chlorination so if you 're going to go independent then that flies in the face of 5.44 because if you win across even just all of Canterbury which is one of the models or the two is pretty close then there 's no point in treating them separately when they 're all the same so at the moment around the country we already have shared services models and council control organizations that deliver numerous water supplies they don 't all use the same treatment for the same source and community so for some source waters and communities there will be one set of treatment processes for a different source water a different reticulation in a different community they will use another approach because the the type of treatment that you use in the system of barriers that you need depends on the quality of your source water and then the quality of your articulation so just because you have one organization delivering multiple community supplies doesn 't mean that you do exactly the same treatment system for those supplies so the governance and management arrangements are different to the technical treatment arrangements and you 're just my final question then is if this model is to come in or something similar to because I know it 's being discussed that mirror forum and so on and democracy will the people actually have the option to have a sound not just a consultation but will there be an actual vote where the people of Christchurch can say you know what we want to be completely independent drink our own water tree their own water the way we want to treat it or not and that 's a question for the Honourable Nanaia Mahuta because I was concerned about it I think it 's important that we understand what 's going on okay we 'll be opportunity to talk about the conversation you had with internal affairs during debate if you wanted to I 'll come to a question from deal my questions following on I 've got similar concerns and the the in 5.43 you mentioned that in this report it states that the principle of public ownership of existing infrastructure will underpin the reforms that the local government will and that local government will continue to be involved in the considerations of the new models but then in 5.44 it says current examples in New Zealand of water Care in Auckland and Wellington water which accompanies have independent board so but the worry that I have in the question that I have is this or do you see what they 're proposing and what you 've written in these two points is it actually a company will dictate to councils what 's going to happen and then their councils and public people we have to pay for it I think there are lots of conversations that will be taking place between local government and central government before any of this do you think from I mean that 's I 'm reading between lines of what 's been written and I don 't think that 's fair to ask our staff what government might be thinking and what the implications of that will be but the helens right and it needs to be a whole lot of conversations with central government they may well come and dictate what happens they may not it 's quite revolting but I think asking our staff know I mean I 'm just asking because it 's being written in this report what it 's doing is quoting the minister and the so this is judge these paragraphs really are just stating the the situation as it currently stands obviously there 's some decision-making that needs to occur within government we would hope that local government would have some influence over that decision-making to what extent that 'll be the case remains to be seen but some I mean certainly the minister has made some comments not least at the recent local government New Zealand conference here in Christchurch that suggests quite strongly whatever you might mean so you are and there are two different conversations of course one of which is and officials two officials conversation and the other of which is a political conversation absolutely indeed there any further questions on the reporters it 's in front of us today and then I 'll come to Yanni yep Mike that 's pump station here so that was for developing new wheels so it 's quite a little more work in developing a new will then there is a remediating an existing room so is there a point time with that zone can be at a hundred percent yes the northwest rest of the city and do I have a timetable for when it 's likely to be no I don 't we don 't sell further modeling work and particularly around that step testing of the conversations to see if we can deliver more water from the secure pumping stations so until we 've done that modeling work we can 't really see out the timelines for it we should Thank You Yanni will come to your questions oh great thank you received responses back on so I 'll get to those in a minute but a very high level I 've also circulated a paper that was written post earthquake and I was it was basically looking at having smaller water supply zones and I just wondered as the stuff could just give us some sense of our current water supply strategy and how the work is related to the strategic approach that we 're taking as a city in reference to our water supply strategy in this report I don 't see reference to the document report that was written by staff and I think a consultant post from that wider strategic point of view how the work that is being proposed and is being done to that thank you that 's the first question downstream effect of from well hits really this the week that Helens doing is around well hits and we 're now looking at reticulation particularly if you have a look at the report that got presented giving the European or the Dutch in the German experience showing the low levels of were leakage from their network compared to our own we believe that if we go down that track might lead us into an ability to isolate two zones and also better measure flow going in and out of those zones so that we can get a far more accurate that 's a piece of work that 's been done at the moment it 's quite difficult for us to come up however with a strategic document when there 's so much unknown up in the air with central government now we believe that there may be a report back to cabinet in August there might be another one in September and there main decisions we don 't think happen till the middle of next year potentially but we are doing some work around that and around our strategy around zoning around our reticulation around you will have recognized we 're doing able to work around pushes owns as well which all feed in to that same picture so there wasn 't work being done on that however we 're not in a position really to recommend anything because there was we 're such in a state of flux at the moment so just in terms of the work that we 're currently doing have we looked at where it 's logical if we wanted to go smaller water supply zones installing the equipment at the same time rather than having to come back and spend more money on contractors and consultants for the durmitor doesn 't really affect the way we zone manager our supply and as Helen says we 're doing quite a lot of modeling through our network and the zones change depending on the time of the day and the time of the year and basically you 've got lot of water from a tool maybe five or even longer than that true in the day households pull a lot of water during early morning at night and so the zones shifting we 're doing a lot of modeling around exactly where that water flows but I couldn 't guarantee anyone who and where they got their water from but the management of the zones is almost on the well heads at the stage to the water supply strategy is it was supposed to be reviewed in 2013 I don 't believe it has can you just advise where the current review is that if it 's been commenced if it 's what the time frame is for that we do have a draft a working draft of the integrated water strategy which takes into combines the west water strategy the water supply strategy and the surface water strategy that we currently have as three separate documents that draft has been on hold well we 've been working with my Tahu over the storm water consent now that the storm water consent is back on track if you like with Environment Canterbury we 've picked up that draft and we 're arranging workshops with the local area groups and that will come up to Council as part of that we will then have a water supply implementation plan and we 've begun work on that we 'd be doing quite a lot of work obviously around earthquake damage that we 've had and Satre flux see as Helen says the comprehensive storm water consent it 's probably been entrained for the last four years so that 's a significant piece of work as has the new regional land and water plan which has also had quite a big impact not only on our storm water consent but the way we will manage all of our surface water issue so there has been work been going on in the background but yes it hasn 't really surfaced at this point at a council level because basically we 're still pulling all the threads together to actually give you that integrated approach and we believe an integrated approach is the right way to go because they have all got into relationships questions that I put through to the briefing as well I are you able just to respond to those or did would you like me to go through them again so you 've got them so there are questions that have been put through as written questions is that right Johnny yes correct yep and you received a response to those so just I 'll just go through there pretty quick but was just I know that someone in Y met counsels obviously have water supplies signed offers secured by the DWA and I was just wondering what examination we 've given to there 's any thing that we can learn from what they 're doing with consultants in contractors in looking at the experience but certainly we are looking at Napier where they have a similar secured groundwater supply and have not been coordinating that supplier in the past so yes we are learning from other territorial authorities have any sense of that we 're being treated the same as they have in terms of the assessment by the engineers in terms of the standard of our well heads have a very similar interpretation you will appreciate we got the peer-reviewed and there was slightly changed but we did look at that so we believe that engineers right across the country are really interpreting the drinking water standards to the same a reasonably same level which is a marked shift from where it was probably 12 months ago it 's also obviously a shift where we could do work in an improvement plan and that was fine there was an improvement plan as was raised by earlier in the discussion but that 's now we have to deliver that plan and that 's really what Helens doing and you have fast track through the LTP okay just two final questions one is what confidence can we have in city care doing further work given that they were involved in the ongoing maintenance of the well heads that is part of the reason why we got to this situation analysis of maybe the situation however we do are working very closely with City care and partnership to make sure that what we have got in our maintenance contracts gets delivered systems that we are now looking at about doing regular monitoring of all the chlorination all the temporary works the water staff are working in close partnership with City care at the moment to deliver the outcome that we were expecting to maintain so we are looking and ensuring that we 're getting what we are asking to be delivered to a quality that we are being delivered so the final question was in regards to just the social and the community initiatives have we done any more work on the distribution of water filters filling containers from service centers at libraries and also and that in a location of collection points for non-chlorinated but I just don 't see much consideration of the social and health impacts around the chlorination in our communities and I just wondered if there 's been any progress in regards to those those issues that have previously being raised but I haven 't seen much progress we have we have expended the information available to the general public so the website has been upgraded and expended we now have a map that shows clearly the city and we 're getting we 're getting very high counts of people going to see that map and we 're also distributing that information through social media so there is certainly anecdotally a lot of social connection across the city where people are going to collect their water from someone else 's house if they 're close to a pump station that still has chlorine and they have friends who do not so I think that as we reduce the chlorine levels across the city there is much less of a problem with that and certainly the number of taste and odor complaints has dropped dramatically so right so it 's unclear we are not going to do any work around providing a location for people to get untreated you can drive up showing frustrated that this is reportedly being raised have been told that this has been worked on and we don 't see any progress the issues of supplying that but we are still working on some of it you did also raise the issue about filters and I might just ask Ross because we have to be maintained and so that 's one of the real issues about getting that information as part of our network as well so that you actually just because you put a filter and doesn 't necessarily mean it 's going to and so there are certain quantity of water because we did look at that at one stage of putting filters in and we did provide you with a memo about filters into some of our libraries but the costs and the maintenance and the need to get industrial size filters was just going to be pretty thank you thank you very much y 'all_''_2319.26 need that 's everything from you that 's great thank you very much Sarah if your able to comment on the we 'll have a look at that I have two comments one is that we are looking at minimizing chemical treatment so that is an alternative chemical treatment rather than having either no treatment or something like altra violet which has no residual so that would put a residual and to the reticulation and copper and silver levels are controlled through the New are required for disinfection now that they 're below the maximum acceptable values so it would comply with that but we would also need to look at making sure that any any new and innovative treatment that isn 't listed and the drinking water standards is accepted by the drinking water Assessor in the vehicle officer of health and that that might be quite a process as well as looking at the costs and silver it 's a bit to the rapport and so we 've caught by the end of the month hopefully 24% of the it would be at least 2013 and so when we do when we do the percentages for you what we 're doing is we 're looking at what it would be looking over a whole year yes so in the wintertime it 'll be the traitor because you 'll favor those those conversations and so in 5% sort of to start with anyway its Creed and so we 'll have a number of pumps where we installed what turned out to be relatively expensive temporary chlorination equipment that has ended up being used of them less than four months and I 'm wondering how much we 've ended up spending on temporary equipment that actually hasn 't been used for very long so that equipment isn 't being discarded so that equipment has been cleaned down and end health for if it may be needed over the summer period or if it may be needed in another application okay but at this point we 've had coronation and some of the pumps for a very short period of time and when as ref was pointing out earlier the risk they she hadn 't_``_2482.069 changed at all since since that the paperwork had changed that 's correct so temporary chlorination has been an expensive exercise and there 's no evidence that we 've got an improved public health outcomes from that 's right thank you any further questions Jimmy conservation campaign because based on information but I didn 't see any the incentive scheme whether can encourage people and fully understand a moment is a kind of extraordinary period whether each one right where they need to serve in their water consumption so and campaign will be over the summer what we 're doing is saying that we if we want to continue with works through the summer period we will need an effective water conservation campaign and we 're going to start by doing a survey to determine what the appetite for a water conservation campaign would be and what types of measures people would be happy to roll out across the city so we 'd like to do that work first and then put in place a water pencil conservation campaign over that summer period thank you sarah vacuum of the city who won 't see as much of a reason to do it because they 'll have an uncorrelated water supply in sochi the framing around it will be I think quite important it 's you know for the good of the city because many people will be yeah and chlorinated by then that 's correct the sad news for the people who will be uncorrelated live in if the demand goes up right across the city pushing framing that really clearly will be really important in the information I saw just in addition to that around there messaging and that is that Christchurch sees itself is quite an environmentally friendly place yeah last summer on the first weekend of December we used the most water in the world per person and we need to be we 're not I don 't think we 're aware enough of that we don 't look at that we don 't look at how much water then it 's like 650 liters of water for every single person in the city and the day there 's an incredible amount when it 's when it 's drinking water quality this is leading to a question yeah okay let 's move on we 're done with questions yep okay great so can I have a mover for these of Vicki right so you want to move what 's in front of us with an additional motion attached as well thank you so make it very clear to departments returning the face that the council is totally opposed to being a water company or authority which goes beyond Christchurch City and means that water is not a required to pay for the cost of remediation drinking water storm water or wastewater for rural and small urban authorities in South Island do we ask them me to write a liter page I 've actually invited if I may speak now yep so we 've got a mover for this Vicki we 've got a second a deal okay so Vicki or indicating you 'd like to engage in debate easily just in relation to and I realized I 've got a short time so I just want to focus on that part that is around five point four four and five point five five and by the way for sex which talks about changes in the way in which the three waters are merged and if you read through the Internal Affairs Department documents that sit with it and the minister speeches it is absolutely clear that they are faced with major issues in relation to the quality of drinking water storm water and wastewater and local authorities across the country especially small local authorities and when you read their papers it looks as though let 's solve authorities and actually making sure that the cities pay for the rural wastewater stormwater and drinking water where they have very few staff very few resources and in the South Island especially around Canterbury very major problems so we are sorting out our water making sure that all aspects of it are at the highest possible standard and then post October this year there are two things coming to cabinet one is the regulatory and then there is this structure that is being created if you look at our budget from last year 40 percent of our topics goes into water wastewater stormwater so if you take that out of the Christchurch City Council you actually disinfect a huge chunk of what we do of our capex it 's slightly less its 28 percent in overall of our budget thirty four point two five percent this year goes into those three waters there is a massive chunk of this council no matter what happens in water the people of Christchurch who have a very strong emotional attachment to all aspects of water need to be able to go to a not our regional authority not a standalone thing no company nothing it needs to be a directly elected authority to which they can go and tell the fact that they are angry or happy or whatever so what we are getting into with this suggestion and and I mean the two suggestions that you 've got in front of you are four and these are not definite yet but I think we need to be very clear about where we stand I spoke to the Department of Internal Affairs this morning and have invited him to come and speak to all councillors because we haven 't all had the same information at the same time so he 's organizing that through the Mia 's Department now and I think that 's really important but if we are going to take you can you know that what 's coming at the smaller rural authorities who have had massive issues with water who have major lakes to to sort out the point of what this is and you don 't need to read between the lines it 's actually in the lines city so bad news Christ dude ratepayers because you 've got an earthquake and the government promised that they would bring you back up to speed and they forgot to do that and then you 've got an issue of small rural authorities who can 't actually deal with this problem and so bad news Christchurch residents and ratepayers you get to pay for that as well well no I 'm sorry that 's not okay the cost of actually fixing the drinking water and throughout New Zealand as I understand it is about the cost of transmission County so the government actually needs to decide which is more important water or roading and so I don 't think it 's fair for them to say Christchurch City ratepayers you 've just fixed your own water at quite major cost and now good news you fit and get to fix kaikoura riscos nelson melbourne who know he 's so one way Mac as well that we know have major problems so I think we need to be very clear about this and I know this is only part of the at the moment I just want to focus on and I think we need to make it absolutely clear to the Department of Internal Affairs that they not need to start looking for other alternatives one simple one would be that they could actually take the GST on rates which I don 't even think is I think it 's marginally legal and actually apply that to sorting out water storm water and waste water throughout the country but they have not considered those options they 've only considered these sort of options so I think we need to be very clear upfront that we 're standing up with people of Christchurch in terms of what we 're prepared to pay and what we 're prepared to do and just so that there 's no ambiguity about it whatsoever thank you thank you I support Vicky 's comments wholeheartedly Thank You Helen for your in team for your update and in the recommendation where it talks about best endeavors undertaking that work there I was at the minister 's or attended the minister 's speech rather at the LG NZ solution must put our context she said that herself in the context of having been to the UK coming back here but in New Zealand whether it she didn 't specify whether it was a New Zealand wide or local context but one thing about our context is that we big on as self-determination which Vicki has just touched on and to me that extends to every ta in the country so context for me is the question and with regard to our Alpine feedwater our very good testing regime I had a conversation with a long-standing councillor of a tube 's 24 years did you ever have any outbreaks you see the worst I think we had a mouse somewhere in the system and Rickett him but it wasn 't a big drama it was quickly overcome so we haven 't had any health outbreaks from our water system we 've had the odd eco like transgression one thing we do have in terms of context do two is a good functional relationship with our regional council one of the factors identified in Havelock North inquiries that set behind been prevented if some of those relationships were better and they 'd be more proactive for me this is looming larger than it 's about us being or becoming even more risk-averse as a country is it about chlorinating the water or is it about becoming more risk-averse so I 'm fully behind what pickiest put is putting forward today I 'll pick up revs point that something changed between August and December but it wasn 't the water it was the goal posts goal posts on wheels and they started shifting out of everyone 's reach I 'm looking forward with my colleagues to becoming chlorine-free again I 'd like to thank Helen Helen again for all the work thank you Dion and then Pauline deal I just wanted to echo what would see by councillor buck as well my my real concern or not actually I 'll come back to the concern that I just wanted to say thank you to the work that is being done as well echo in the words bloom was saying and I think we should be celebrating some of that work that pretty difficult from some of these reports if you read them how complex some of the workers but I am concerned that the goal posts will continue to move and I am concerned that in this report we have two paragraphs that actually talk about specifically what 's going to happen next and we have no control over there under the work we 're doing at the moment so my concern is that we 're doing all this work at the moment and actually the goal posts will further change and then the goalposts will further change when we have to start paying for what the public starts having to pay for work that somebody independent tells us to do and in the city perm rate payers and right throughout the whole country don 't actually have any control over there and that 's a big concern and which is why I support the the the additional amendment that 's been put forward because we do need to say that people who pay this pay this work to be done actually should have some sort of say in this because is going to be difficult and we do have good different circumstances here around the supply of our water which comes from under the ground I mean I find it ridiculous how much water you know and on the west coast they get six meters of water a year you could just open your mouth when it rains and you get all the water you want but they 'll be put under the same rules and regulations that we do here and other places I mean you could just go down to a river and get some water and drink it and they 're gonna start sort of regulating rivers so I mean it 's it 's it 's going to be a very interesting time moving forward but thank you for the work that you have done and I do think that moving forward we are going to as a council have to have conversations because in this report it does explicitly say that that 12 month time frame in the January resolution will probably be not be able to be met so I think we are going to manage that and what we actually do and what we say to our communities Pauline and then Sarah make the deadline come hell or high water hell and high water I 'd also like to congratulate having on this amazing report and s Dion has said it 's incredibly complex we 've been all over this many many months now and it 's still very difficult to get your head around the many facets of this situation in its ever-changing I 'm almost those goal posts but look you know basically you know we 've chosen my teachers counselors chosen to be proactive in you 've jumped in and are upgrading program and our response to the learnings from heavily north so we 've chosen to treat this as a ruining situation and you know I think it 's big ups for that we 've opted to spend millions and millions of dollars none of that has been wasted no matter what happens in the future so it 's a very fine balancing act knowingly we 're in how to spend that money into congratulations again for handling it very month our 24 percent of our water will have no chlorine in it I mean that 's fantastic in a reduction of the dose by heart which is awesome we 're also looking at we 're running a parallel program with short-term to keep their chlorine out in a long term to ensure that our infrastructures robust in best practice and I love what you said Helen about we 're planning in we 've doing at the same time we see the report on the Dutch practices which have been hailed as best practice if we follow down their path which I hope that we do we could be facing some increased costs for delivery but I certainly will not be supporting any government mandate for price to be financially supporting other TAS near creating three waters we 're doing all we can ourselves spending millions of dollars to assure ourselves and our residents that we believe our systems are secure and the government should and could look for other ways to support our surrounding two years rather than leaning on us to support them we won 't be the losing control we 've had youth quakes floods fire and now the chlorination all costing millions of not billions of their rate payer dollars because this is significant for Christchurch and our water is our number one priority and I still believe that because we 're blessed with that would pure groundwater not everyone has the opportunity to have ground water to drink a lot of places have to drink surface water which is far riskier in sometimes recycled and treated water so we ask be sure and also we 're special because we have the expertise in the world to demonstrate the safety of our drinking water and we do need to drill down to the excuse the pun and to their tune public ownership what does that really mean and what are the risks that belie that so Christchurch in this council I believe is ready to stand firm and protect our pure resource of our deep equal for drinking water and to be able to access that and it 's pure state untreated it is frustrating for us waiting for the government reports and announcements and requirements however like mama chicken and communed Helen and who team for managing this and to plan and do at the same time in ensuring that the money we 're spending and to address Aaron 's sure about a high water consumption we do have to remind ourselves that we are the Garden City and we do make a lot of beer and we do drink more beer in the summer beer for it is why we do use more water in the summer so the conservation cool for residents will be a very interesting one if it 's gardeners they need to start now by looking at mulching so you don 't need so we need to get on to that pronto so I will also be supporting the additional amendment thank you so I 've got Sarah Erin and Phil Sarah thank you unacceptable that our water supply would be amalgamated with other regions and disingenuous too so that will be publicly owned when it 's clear that it wouldn 't be democratically governed but right here right now in Christchurch I have a real issue with the amount the the tempra coronation for such a short timeframe when it 's clear that there 's been no public measurable public health benefit for there and when those many millions of dollars could have been spent and steered in that time and energy focused on actually repairing the infrastructure that needed it to start with I think that 's and would have been a much better place for our time and energy and staff resources a rate payers money to be spent would have been getting interest rate into that work rather than spending months looking at how to temporary chlorinate when much of it has only been used for such a short amount of time we need to keep the chlorine out of our water there has been no increased public health risk nothing had changed we need to spend that money on getting our infrastructure up to standard not just good enough to get rid of the chlorine but we needed it to be good enough to meet any new standards that the government has and it includes every tick ulation system which is a key component have the aquifer and we completely overreacted in a room and then Phil Aaron oh I first you 'd like to thank and congratulate the Crusaders for winning on the weekend even though they were drinking chlorinated water and just to clarify one thing a year beer takes 61 to 180 liters of water to make one liter of beer so that could mean that everyone in Christ is just drinking approximately 5 litres of beer a day in summer just saying that 's Ireland I just want to raise one point based on the addition that 's been made and there is around the minister that is leading the charge on this or in charge of this water across the whole country so not a great model and in my book and they 've chlorinate across the whole country and England so not the best model to look at I 'd be a lot happier if she went to the Netherlands and then finally just that people should get a vote if there is going to be permanent chlorination any parts in New Zealand that don 't already have it vote otherwise there is no mandate to permanently chlorinate their water I believe in the democracy it 's such a massive change to to our country and our way of life especially in this city that the people should get about not a consultation thank you I think thank you and I 'm gonna support the amendments the additional recommendations there I think it is important to send a signal to the DIA into government and in fact yeah I can 't the future company approach just isn 't on clearly that there is an indication about that it could be and would remain public ownership and this government I 'm sure would intend to do there it doesn 't mean that something that might would be in public ownership in the future by whether an amalgamated authority wouldn 't be would not be privatized later on by another government so however I thought I think that the important parts to this report that the developing information which we had received in terms of the of the of the different treatments that are going to be available and that 's and we 're going to get further advice to around some of the other treatments and like Kate a leader I 'll be certainly very interested as I indicated to look at the ultraviolet treatment and how effective and cost-effective that will be I think it 's bit clear from this report that unfed be up chlorine isn 't the only tool in the toolbox it 's one barrier it isn 't totally effective and so we are going to have to look at other other options and they will come to us so there I think it is fear at the stage to flag their era era position to future water companies and having to pay for the costs for wider regions would infect our council currently paying a huge amount of available project funding is for keeping a deal thank you very much support Vicky 's amendment I think it 's a very good addition but first of all I 'd like to thank Helen and Dave and their team for the work that they 've done this report but I 'm I guess that the key thing to its residents well before we were required to add chlorine and change the well here to do other things to that so I do want to congratulate our team and our staff for doing it for many many years with regards to the the the slide show that was the three waters review which was a New Zealand government and um internal affairs on page 28 requires answering some tough questions these some of these Christians how do we assure communities and visitors we were actually doing it before we were lumbered with the cost of chlorination how much will it cost to meet national directions and community aspirations for fresh water again we were doing that you could argue that it 's been expensive it 's over a third of air rights go into the three waters but water is absolutely crucial the other part of that question how do we meet national directions well that 's costing our ratepayers of fortune at the moment but there are very two very different things how do we meet increasing community expectations relating to drinking water well the expectation of and obviously drinkable we were meeting those we 've been meeting those for many many years and our staffs testing regime as well and truly above what was required by the national standard leading into this so how do we how can you raise an expectation when it is really simple expectation of clean and safe drinking water the other question how can community how can commute communities with small or declining rates waste fund renew renewals of aging infrastructure and this is around drinking water it 's not a question for the ratepayers of Christchurch who are being stretched at five point five percent of rates at the moment there is a question that those communities must ask their elected members and their officials and then government that 's not a Christian for the great powers of Christchurch so as I said I will be absolutely supporting this and I hope this is see they 're very clear message to those an eternal affairs and the government thank you okay and finally coming to mic thank you well I voted against a chlorinated our water back and generally a try and get the ghetto water back to being untreated as as quickly as possible you know it 's not surprising but it is I guess disappointing to hear that there 's actually been no public health benefit from the temporary chlorination of our drinking water and it has come at great expense at a time where you know we see what 's happening with central government where that they are hidden all our money needs to be put in to our drinking water infrastructure to make sure that we do get an exemption you know the alarm bells have been ringing for some time with what 's happening centrally I mean those bells are getting louder and louder it 's absolutely shocking to see the prospect that the ratepayers of Christchurch may have to start being responsible for other regions around cephalo South Island it 's absolutely abhorrent and I will oppose it and I support this resolution thank you Yanni 's indicated that he 'd like to speak to this as well yawning yeah absolutely and I just had a question for the mover and the second day really strongly support the amendment I do wonder whether we should be also directing this to the mural forum and to local government New Zealand and I just wondered whether we could include those two parties to it so would you start in some wording that reflects that yep thank you I just I 'll just talk to the amendment and the substantive at the same time it was moved by Vicky seconded by D on the whole look so I 'm just going to put it as one motion that 's great so just in regards to the the amendment first and it 's one resolution but the amendment that was put forward as part of that I do think it is really important to point out that you know this this has been as others have said this has been a response to the Havelock North inquiry and in some ways it has felt like it 's been forced on us but I think one of the points that the mayor made in the previous debate which I had a lot of sympathy for was the fact that our water we are the ones that now have the decision about when we wish to remove it and I think that 's a really important point if we 've been forced to do it by the medical officer of Health then that would have as I understand it being largely out of our control and we could have been facing possibly a lot longer timeframe for when we get to make that get to remove chlorine from our water so I think you know number of cancers have referred to in the debate that this was forced on us I think actually we did make the decision ourselves based on you know it was a pretty limited choice but the medical officer Health had indicated that they would serve notice on us if we didn 't make that decision has been some advantages to us making that decision and that we get to control when we remove chlorine from our work and and then we see possibly what the consequences are in regards to the amendment it 's really important that although there 's been a lot of reference is a move in New Zealand to basically do the same thing to water that was done to electricity in fact the local government whose own funding review discussion document believe it was from 2015 and I quote says that basically examples in New Zealand of unit waste water and waste management being provided under corporate and the corporate structures but these institutional structures have not been adopted uniformly across councils there it goes on to say that they believe that public utility models mean there 's clear separation between policy and regulatory functions and service delivery and that that model contrasts with the more traditional models of service delivery within local authorities which tend to compromise the effect of services or insufficient charges soft budget constraints weak efficiency and senators in low accountability and then it goes on to say that the gains for clear accountability for service delivery and performance of the utility drives cost savings and improvements in service quality and that those gains have been extensively documented following the corporatization of the former electricity departments in power boards so what we can see is from 2015 privatize and corporatized water supply it 's a gold rush and I think what 's playing out in terms of Havelock model has been that 's really served as ammunition to further that they 're aggressive charge towards privatizing and corporate izing our water and for anyone to think that the electricity reforms have had any benefit for local people local consumers you when we 've seen costs go through the roof we 've seen huge chief executive pay packets on what is effectively monopolies delivering a basic service to people that should be a fundamental right so I think we should be really concerned and we need to make sure and be as proactive as possible in making our opposition to this no and just finally I do want to commend the staff for the work they 've done around the well heads and the in the pump stations but you know I do think we 're missing the big strategic piece of work around what we do in terms of water supply we have a water supply strategy really conservation programs were supposed to be part of that adequately they seem to be a soft touch in terms of the budget cuts and so what we see through the LTP and the annual plan is that you know water conservation measures are not adopted in terms of our strategy because that something that is not seen as a budget priority now we 're in a situation where we 're having to go back and ready to start ramping up those sorts of campaigns again and personally I think we need to urgently review that water supply strategy the fact that we haven 't reviewed it in ten years I think is a concern particularly post-earthquake where we want to have a greater resilience in our communities so I welcome the report today very happy to support the amendment it 's not that 's not a pleasant position for us to be in as a city but the sooner we progress the sooner we can take whoring out of our work thank you thank you I think just one thing I want to make clear around the coronation is that it was a proactive move from Council we only breathing down our necks we didn 't have a concern about the water supply it was a strategic decision knowing that if we did this for 12 months we could address any particular well heads that were of concern but we were very clear we were only going to do this for 12 months and I think the one thing missing in this report is that fact and there 's an assumption actually that we may continue the chlorination beyond 12 months I certainly don 't have that in the conversation and not just assume we 're gonna move to conservation or switching off different pump stations it 's good work to be doing you know the well heads do need to be the best they can be and it 's difficult to talk about that because we haven 't had the report back here the Robertson report so it 's difficult to know what the situation was that led to some of these issues so I support the work that is being done but I do want to make clear that I don 't support chlorinating water supply past agnostic about that that 's yeah I prefer to see a proposal before I make a decision on it but I 'm happy to support it today so just to wrap up I mean I 'd certainly like to thank staff for what 's a very detailed report and what clearly is a very large volume of work that some of that 's going on to lead to the outcomes that we 've talked about this morning maximizing the delivery of untreated water it 's great to see the amount of chlorine in the water reduced and the amount of on chlorinated water coming into the network also been reduced and planned to be further reduced listening some numbers it 's clear that this is a major and program of work and I 'm pleased to see that you are doing everything that you possibly can to look at different ways of speeding up the work program with a clear focus on reducing and then removing the chlorine from the water supply as soon as possible I guess these are exactly the conversations that we hope to be having looking at reducing and removing chlorine and I 'd reiterate the point that 's been made the original council resolution allows for chlorination of the water for 12 months I 'm pretty confident that we would not be looking at extending that 12-month chlorination period I certainly my view is the chlorine was in there for 12 months we do what we need to do within the 12 months and then the chlorine comes out I 'm reasonably confident that that would be the view that we would take at that time and therefore that 's the context in which we 're working but we certainly look forward to the upcoming reports which have been signaled this morning the UV treatment is certainly an area of interest and could well be quite a large part of the the solution to all of this and again it 's good that you 're you 're looking at all different ways of dealing with this and not just going straight to continued chlorination as the way that we we need to deal with now only additional resolutions that have been put by Vicky seconded has been talked about you know broadly for some time and yannis made the point that this conversation really predates have a lot of north and wraping water up in a CCO or some other body which isn 't necessarily governed by a democratically elected people current government has got a commitment the water supply under whatever model would remain in public ownership but of course once you 've created a CCO or some other vehicle it 's very easy under a different set of policies from a government which may not share that view for that CCO then to subject to privatization which would then see control of the the water supply further removed from the people and of course ownership of water is something that I imagine would form quite a big part of that debate as well particularly in New Zealand with the the particular constitutional arrangements the Treaty of Wieck and Waitangi and so on that we 've got here we 're very familiar as a as a territorial authority of what the cost of assuming the networks and the the infrastructure of a small rural significant contribution from Christchurch City Council in to waste water schemes in particular at the moment on Banks Peninsula and like a number of other small rural authorities who have either chosen to under invest or probably more likely haven 't had the ability because of small populations to adequately invest in those water supply wastewater stormwater infrastructures the the city as a whole with Banks Peninsula included of course is now bearing the cost of waste water improvements for lyttelton harbour waste water improvements for a koala harbour and I think it would be untenable for the people of the city to be expected to pay for those sort of infrastructure improvements across the whole of the north of the South Island or the whole of Canterbury or whatever it may be so I 'm also supportive of the additional resolutions that have been put as a result of the discussions that we 've had today we we 're in a position where we 've got some significant expenses of sitting in dealing with what we need to do ourselves to look after our own residents within Christchurch City us and because of needing to look to support other rural authorities with small populations and and the lack of ability to pay for what we know is expensive infrastructure certainly isn 't something that I would support so I 'm certainly pleased to support all of these resolutions today so I 'll put Pauline alright so I will now put the motion all those in favor please say ally against that 's Kerry thank you and thanks to staff for detailed answers to questions in the detail report we will now break for morning tea so let _"

    "text": "now move into public participation and we 'll start this morning with a public participation item from Genevieve Robinson regarding construction at Littleton port and hectors dolphins so genevieve if you 'd like to come forward to the table please thank you for joining us this morning you 're very welcome you 've got five minutes to present to us this morning thank you yep if the green lights on the microphone is working I believe our PC has not done due diligence and investigating alternative construction methods or alternative Wharf locations for this project you have not demanded more transparent actions for the welfare of endangered species that hector 's dolphin is considered endangered at a national and international level while their main threats around fishing activities construction activities also have been identified as another threat hector 's are regularly recorded within the harbor area with around 10 to 20 individuals there at any one time past studies information you have shows clear avoidance reactions to pile-driving activity within the Inner Harbor professor Stephen Dawson of Otago University is an underwater acoustics and hector 's dolphin biology expert he from recent LPC based piling sources this shows a decrease in the rate of dolphin echolocation detections was evident on days with piling computer days without the dolphins are displaced into areas of the harbour the FI putting them more at risk of other threats the pile-driving noise levels could cause temporary hearing damage to hector 's if they remain at close range to off construct marine scientist dr. Elizabeth Luton considers the current self-regulating threshold of a hundred and forty six decibels used by LPC for their current land-based piling very large and causes hearing damage as an absolute minimum requirement LPC should be constantly measuring noise levels not making assumptions set the piling will be under that level throughout pile driving operations of 2015 and 16 Littleton port company use Marine Mammal observers to monitor the area surrounding pile-driving LPC says they do this again they will do this again from the new booth design however this there is no indication at what stage of the piling this monitoring will commence there is a different standard of care being applied to this particular project which puts the port alone has little ability to effectively protect dolphins and virtually none from behavioral impacts as for each dolphins spotted I 've above the water and other lies below this is fact during previous Wharf construction using rammed piles hit two sightings were recorded within 300 metres shutdown zone during pile driving LPC project director Jared Peterson advised that on the 27th of July he still had no idea who the trained to mammal observers would be and who would be training them though he did believe their poor thron would be initiating this at some stage he believes there is no urgency in obtaining relevant documents for peer review or opinion and their observers would only be used during sea based piling currently more than 330 land-based piles have been rammed into rocks of the entrance of the Inner Harbor and I used land-based very lightly what 's again a photograph I took on Monday as you can see from the photograph the piles are exceptionally close to water level offering basically no land between piling and water itself mr. Peterson also advised that noise levels of the current land-based 's decibels but was unable to accurately tell me what level as New Zealand has no underwater noise regulations except for the voluntary code of seismic surveys LPC is applying his own untested data in an environment that needs special attention last year LPC contracted quorum to conduct an assessment of the effects of marine mammals for Lyttelton port companies channel deepening project authored by Deanna Clement with an assessment the heap does Dolphin Peninsula population is listed between two and six thousand individuals well research published by scientists published and scientific journals by Otago University indicates a more realistic population above 1,000 that 's slightly different with such inflated information informing passport risk management they can be little confidence of impact and mitigation accuracy therefore the real issue we need to consider here is the noise pollution to itself the pile driving and the piles itself Dawson and Luna s 'en offer the only research and recorded recordings offered by rammed piling noise pollution in the area during previous consent processing last year marine scientist Eva Luna s 'en approached politics might Abbott for advice on using screw piles the piledriver technology was not available in New Zealand Mr Abbott did say screw piles would be viable if smaller well this brings us to the new birth design James would also politic offers conflicting information he said that while pipe piles right screw piling would be quieter engineering viability in the situation was the issue that allows us to the end of the five minutes I will give you I have requested all relevant information from LPC 14 days ago I 've also done a little boy man I have no information on the design the poll learnings or calculations or tech geotech information I 've requested a civil engineer with 50 years experience in wolf design has requested this information and is going to do a peer review for me for free however with that the information I am able to advance us further it 's not up to me or others to conduct this vital research it 's up to LPC and it 's up to you guys as shareholders by manipulating this design to fit within the scope of the port recovery plan I 'm sorry actions we ask for transparency expert advice peer review Marine Mammal observers now not in two months time [Music] procedures in place and the postponement of piling if necessary until next winter thank you very much so and thank you very much indeed for the presentation now there are a number of documents that have been uploaded to the hub for councillors so we 've heard the presentation this morning we 've got a number of supporting documents that are available and have been available for councillors which is their QA document yeah yep that 's all yep that 's also been uploaded for the councillors as well I 'm sorry you don 't get any credibility unless you 're published in the scientific journal all right so I note that comment I also want to acknowledge the letter from World Animal Protection and which has also been circulated I think the most sensible thing to do with the information that you 've provided us this morning the written information and what we 've heard verbally this morning got Paul Monroe the chief executive of CC HL who 's actually like to refer the matters that you 've raised to Paul so that he can refer those on to LPC and so that we can get some info information back from LP so you addressing the issues that you 've raised and obviously that 's something that would then be considered by councillors but allow us to get the information back from the port addressing the matters you 've raised there some new information that you 've raised in global presentation but it certainly would be good you know we need a level of confidence around these things and I think to refer to c c HL so that we can get that level of confidence back from LPC or ask for the questions as we need and is the way to go so thank you very much indeed for taking the time to present to us this morning thank you joined us this morning by AV link Yanni good morning great our second item of public participation this morning we 've got the Selwyn 2 tspoon problem-solving team now this item will take the form of a presentation from present once the presentation of occurs occurred so we 've got a five-minute presentation first and then I 'll be very pleased to present some certificates following on from that so if the students would like to come up to the front Thank You Pauline yeah did you want to make some introductory comments now you 've been you 've arranged all of these 17 project but these girls were the New Zealand future problem-solving winners and the title of the problem was it is let 's bike Christchurch and it involves a unique promotion idea which they pitched to our committee earlier this year and they 'll talk to us about it today we absolutely loved it and we 've expressed a strong desire for the City Council to work with them in any way that we can to keep this project up and running so without further ado alright so you 've got five minutes to present to us and then we will present the certificates so yeah welcome and we 're certainly looking forward to hearing from you this morning we want to increase the usage of 's like cracks two designs that look like this in a local cafes in cycle ways once you find your bike you can take a picture that it uploaded to social media using the hashtag it 's like Christchurch we wanted to get a community let 's people the community involved with our project so we decided to contact local schools around the cycle lace to decorate these bikes they did a wonderful job with creating them and we had a strict criteria that we want to be able to follow and they 'll throw them very well we also got aspect to Island school to speak in the assembly and short presentation so last year we represented sow in house go in the future problem-solving national competition in Auckland and in this year we represented New Zealand in their future problem-solving international conference in came out in third place we also been working on designing the website is nucleus day 's mission about our project and why we decided to do it videos that link to the precious to the council and of course how do you work with but we really launched a meeting in September and we have also created a PSA a public service announcement video what they have our IT technician Jimmy this video helps with my idea and get people a good idea of what we want to achieve on behalf of the lips like pastures team I want to say we would like to think that ite committee for all their help and support throughout this project now we will show you a PSA all right well we 're trying to get video to work there any questions that some counselors might like to ask the the Selwyn house team [Music] [Music] [Music] great bless some have a look at the video which is now working did you know then amazing the cycle network is under construction is part of the earthquake recovery program car seat is now crisscross with dozens of kilometers of cycle lanes shared path and designated cycle ways we can now bike around Christchurch safely and quickly [Music] something that should hear you add to that on your bike Saren High School is partner with the class you should yourself with the side and upload it to social media using the hashtag weight spike 5 shapes doing some awesome [Music] [Applause] so thanks for the excellent presentation this morning and thanks for showing us that particularly excellent video as well as some this great stuff so congratulations on the work that you 've been doing promoting cycling in Christchurch but also congratulations on winning the New Zealand stage of the future problem-solving competition and also well done for being placed third at the International future problem-solving competition in Wisconsin I think that 's that 's a huge achievement by anybody 's standards so well down there so that 's great and even better that you 've come here to tell us all about it this morning your projects got the potential to have much broader benefits than just for yourselves and for the school we 're obviously creating the the major cycleways Network in Christchurch and one of the reasons we 're doing that is to make it safe for school students to get safely to and from school but also there 's a recreation benefit to having those you 've come up with this project to encourage children and families and people in general to get out there and really use and enjoy the cycle ways and of course everything that you 're doing is promoting the fact that the cycle ways are there and encouraging people to use them so what I 've got now is some certificates that I 'd like to present to you to really recognize the the great achievement that that you 've got here so we 'll present the certificate so I will invite you to come forward one at a time and then there 'll be an opportunity for a group photograph at the end if that 's what you 'd like to do all right so I 'll call you up one at a time okay so I 've called you up one at a time so first of all clear we claimed I am a next Sophie Hodgson and next Lucy Maynard [Applause] Maya how song [Applause] read MacUser Bonnie Smith Phoebe Donald [Applause] last of the students are certainly not least cape girlie we 've got a certificate we can get our warden at the bet to the cycleways yes [Applause] fantastic thank you thank you very much indeed okay so that into the public participation section of the meeting we 've got one deputation still to come but before we and I will move the deputation next so I 'd like to invite one McCandlish to the table please so wrong good morning thank you for joining us we 've got a paper on the agenda that what you 're presenting potentially relates to so we 're treating this as a deputation to the meeting that means you 've got ten minutes but that would include time that you might want to leave for any questions so maximum of 10 minutes including questions clearly we 've got some literature which has just been distributed now and so you have 10 minutes to present to us this morning thank you very much about the venture question of chlorine in the water supply my name 's Ron McCandless I 'm the CEO of a company whose American technology that offers a far better alternative to treating water than chlorine in it which all go through the very first item is a picture of the Royal Washington DC which was a mess of presentation with over 400,000 gallons of water there in the form of reflection pools and fountains it is entirely treated by this disc aromatic system and is maintained since 2004 in sparkling condition the second picture is in the machinery room for the War Memorial and it shows descaler medic water treatment and also [Music] on the wall there are two copper silver ionization units that are used to disinfect the water the second third photo is over an installation in Taiwan showing that there 's quite a bit of flexibility with the system there 's actually three two hundred gallon a minute units the intended working into a manifold and the same can be done with the copper silver ionisers the next piece of paper is from a company called carefree clear water limited who actually manufacture systems they and it 's actually still used today in the international space station so it 's got to be good because there 's no types of and zinc buyer side the positively charged ions form electrostatic bonds with the negatively charged sites on the micro organism cell walls distorting permeability and preventing the proper intake of nutrients this couple will protein denaturalization causes cell lysis indeed bacteria were killed rather than really suppressed ions provide residual protection and prevention of any recontamination once the ionization is 100% effective in all water temperatures prevents corrosion types of piping as an excellent biofilm penetration was extremely low residual effects and as affected throughout the entire system of plumbing including the low flow areas this is an addition to the environmental safety automation of an economic benefits documented improvement over the last two decades this is not new this is well proven technology then there is some notes and quotes from some professional papers the one in particular here which is extremely powerful its experience of the first 16 hospitals using copper saw violin ization for Legionella control and implications for the evaluation of other disinfection modalities this is the world recognized paper written by Jenna t-step who 's a PhD and Victor oh you who is a medical doctor I work over the whole thing but the conclusions from this study represents the final step in a proposed four-step evaluation processor for disinfection systems that includes demonstrated efficacy of Legionella eradication anecdotal experiences in preventing Legionnaires disease in individual hospitals control studies and individual hospitals and validation and confirmatory reports from multiple hospitals during a prolonged period of time between five and 11 years copper silver ionization is now the only disinfection modality to have fulfilled all four evaluation criteria of the 16 hospitals responded to the questionnaire the hospitals were in 8 different states the mean number of beds was 435 these are not small hospital and 56% of them performed transplant surgery all of the 16 hospitals originally surveyed in 1995 responded to the follow-up survey in 2000 almost all using copper silver ionization for Legionella disinfection the duration of system operation ranged from 5 to 11 years with a mean of 7 years 94 percent 15 out of the 16 continued to perform routine environmental monitoring for Legionella at various intervals kissing was performed quarterly in four of the hospitals every six months and for the hospitals on Legionella is it Legionella is like the canary in the coalmine as far as pathogens in are consumed on page three no cases of possible acquired Legionnaires disease were diagnosed after the installation of the proper silver ionization system in 94 percent of 15 out of 16 of the hospitals one Hospital did report a case of hospital-acquired Legionnaires disease soon after installation basically before the system had settled in now our discussion disinfection and modalities currently in use for Legionella control and hospital water distribution systems include copper silver ionization thermal eradication which is super heating flash and type of chlorination wiper coronations has proven disappointing as a long-term solution due to the high expense the pipe corrosion the introduction of carcinogenic byproducts is at the drinking water and difficulty in maintaining a high concentration two to four parts per million of chlorine needed to sustain efficacy in the past few years carcinogenic byproducts from chlorination and increases in birth defects and spontaneous abortion have raised concerns from federal agencies and consumer interest groups a meta-analysis of ten case control studies and two cohort studies concluded that the significant spontaneous abortions have also been linked to the consumption of chlorinated water although ozonation instantaneous heating systems and ultraviolet light will conceptually attractive solutions and field trials pages about wage successes controlled studies of five years or longer have been reported for any of the three methods controlled studies have supported the biologically plausible concept that the single most important factor in decrease in the incidence of hospital-acquired Legionella disease is the eradication of the reservoir for this microorganism the uniform finding of disappearance of hospital-acquired Legionnaires disease in 16 diverse hospitals catering to different patient populations and different geographic areas confirms the primary importance of the reservoir and the causation of Legionnaires disease in fact there are no cases of hospital-acquired Legionnaires disease during the four years from 1990 and 1999 to 2002 seventy-five percent or 12 of the 16 of the surveyed hospitals reported the failure of previous attempts to control Legionella by other methods now that brings us to the end of the ten minutes so thank you ask you just to quickly wrap up that would we 'll be great thank you okay the four-hour of healthcare engineers confirming what we 've learned this is very good table we 're looking at all the different forms of disinfection water once again copper silver and I said ionization is very highly regarded and the least the other papers in here are from large American companies that are independent of those papers I 've just quoted they have worked with disk aromatic for decades and have found the the water treatment systems to be absolutely first but do what they 're supposed to do all right thank you very much indeed for providing this information and for taking the time to present to us this morning unfortunately that doesn 't allow time for questions but what I am going to do is to bring the water paper that 's on our agenda up the agenda so that we discuss that next we 've got the literature that you 've provided thanks very much indeed for taking the time to present this morning thank you thank you _"

to stand right thanks Chris so Syria you tell us bringing bling which is scientistic so every year the bike to the Future Awards are awarded to partnership between NZTA and award which we handily won for the unicycle route which is absolutely fantastic and then the other category winners October that 's gonna be held again this year that one and the revolutionary award which is fantastic and we had a bit to do with it too which is great and then and then we also won the supreme award for the unicycle route as well to obese bike project in the country which is just amazing really fantastic and it 's very clear from talking to the transport professionals and advocates and other elected members in Palmerston North eight people well other places might be doing one or two really cool individual things which is really good so I just call out quickly and you know team who have done amazing work and work on Isaac 's JC city key joint been shared W speak opus and a couple of staff members who were integral to the project that are no longer working for Council Sir John Hannah and Jimmy D Oney who he be involved in driving it as well really really cool yeah the front desk so we can signature information do you want like you 've got a video as well [Music] [Music] great news that 's lovely thank you very much to David they look awesome and right we 're going to go on to why Cora Drake was a little scared to come to come she have a CDHP meeting so agenda and making room for me and so I 'm happy to take most of the report is read and just highlight obviously the part a as well as a couple of other smaller things so the part a was regarding the tea kiosk and an ugly part there were four there were four proposals for for the use of us three were deemed non camera three were deemed commercial and one was was classified as non commercial we put a note on this to go to you guys that basically said we wanted some greater clarity from staff around what is commercial and what is non-commercial because we felt there was one proposal from the existing tier that could have some more they does have some non-commercial benefit and we just kind of wanted to be able to compare apples with apples and get some clarity about about how those two pull out was the leave granted to cap to the community board in the district licensing committee for a lawyer to appear on their behalf around the through certain fire fury road liquor store so we 're still just waiting to hear a little bit more about this as well as that I wanted also to mention the Rose trap Rose Chapel Historic Trust so that 's going out you know say sorry I 'm having trouble finding the notes that 's been less advertised soon anyway for therefore the use of their building and I think you can book at marriage sorry I said what are you oh okay um okay well that 's that 's my report here thank you very much indeed Jake other any questions from anyone here not a question but it 's an it point out just on the oh just on the screen behind Vicky 's here um it was um we had the opening of the recognition aircraft it 's like way over the holidays as well and I 've got to say that once those def adore bowels are out it there are lots of people using it all the time it 's really high amenity it 's safe and once that whole route is complete oh but I would think that would be our next winner that 's next year 's entry I think I went for a bike it 's Mike right down it 's pretty cool right yeah it 's not quite as beautiful with the one I reckon but it 's perfect it 's actually stunning it 's really stunning yes yeah Pauline can I just add to that to that it 's actually they no idea to run the cycle wave down is immediately between the truth actually came in there but later on and it was a really good idea but the tricky thing is to go to do that without damaging the roots so the whole way that they 've done there has been fair test and something like 3,600 of porous pavers that kind of another 150 new trees with a currently being planted and they 've actually planted more difficult all versus well so I think it is arguably most feared and that 's a wonderful so they really are starting to to keep the runs on the board with these cycle ways in as I see it the only everyone that 's open is going to make it more easy for everyone to see what an incredible vision this is for the city once we get the thirteen connected cycle a race finished its one project it 's an incredible visionary project a name that 's just going to be wonderful but little by little it 's starting to appear and as as Serie C Christchurch is being quite well we speak did around the country for heading this vision and people looking to us and we 're very lucky that if we 're at at starting gauges we are because we 're able to react see state in CTA funding which can be up to 50% sometimes more and it 's a huge help so we were actually ready to go with all those announcements came out and so you know what just went in here to other things to other things I just want to really quickly point out were a lot of fun and also there was a joint community board seminar yesterday about an alcohol licensing so that information is valuable Jake can I just pick you up on the liquor licensing thing does that mean that community boards can now appear at liquor licensing hearings not to my understanding nine not okay okay but you can have a legal representation I think they 've been giving delegations right sorry thanks Vicky Jake I was gonna ask you a similar question but when the board go to the Imperial Authority I is the board looking at making a submission or actually supplying evidence to lose that Kate let 's come up as being a really hip I can comment so the hearings the chair the hearings panel at that previous hearing gave leave for the community board to actually engage and provide evidences it wasn 't expected that they would do it beforehand but that 's what happened and so there was a workshop yesterday on the roles responsibilities of community boards and thus particularly these hearings so you get some clarification of that and it may to community boards around providing submissions as opposed to supporting other of a community Thank You Carlene and I 'm glad the points been raised because in fact I was at the workshop and it seemed to seem to me that there was a lack of clarity where some on the distinction between at the stage whether we can we give evidence or make a submission so I just raise even a side of Claire I know we don 't make the same mistake for yeah okay I 've got clean any temple all right just just sorry I apologize I couldn 't make the workshop but there 's a because your is a clear difference between making a submission and evidence because when you put an evidence you 've got to be prepared for cross-examination so I think when we get advice whether it 's community water counselors or whatever it 's all about preparation if you 're going to step over the line from submission to evidence so I 'm not telling you how to suck eggs but I mean that 's a different thanks man you 're snows well yeah it 's it 's really clear that council delegated to community boards the ability to sickly to be heard at the initial district licensing airing when it goes to are up for appeal the community board can also sick leave what we 've done in this case in terms of Phillips Taylor 's actually sort of led with the council so we 're just having one we 're representing both the community board and kaolin but it is kind of different I think we need to be really careful that the community board is not there as a party it 's there as a special wets official recognition on behalf of the council the director or authority and it does need to be some clarity and some I think needed guidelines around just that process that is quite unclear even the legislation itself around things like deadlines for when information needs to be provided who you should provide the information one of the key questions that camera our community board at the initial district licensing hearing well shouldn 't we have legal representation and we lost some from having some really guidelines around how community people it 's clear involved then hopefully that workshop yesterday which I wasn 't that there 's a good start and was progressing some really okay thank you thanks for that I 'll put the motion to receive the community board report and then if you want to we 'll deal with the tea kiosk as well is everybody okay with it okay so I 'll just put the sorry Dion moves and Sarah seconds I 'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed to carried and would you like my number for a number fourteen now the tea kiosk which was your problem it seems that the staff and the community border on the same site that same stuck I mean this this kind of just I 'll just introduce it that came to the community board we had a discussion about what community use was and this recommendation is just saying can we look at the the items that were there are they community use and then bring that to the community board or back to the will come back to a further recommendation to the council so this is really just a passing it through so the staff can give advice and then it goes back to the community board to discuss and then will come back to us right so the news new recommendation is that the council issue were closed RFP process to both requests for information applicants this to include a definition of what constitutes a community use with relevant relevant evaluation attributes in order to allow effective comparison you 've got it all there yeah okay right moved deal soothing dead zero no debate put those have have to say aye those opposed to carry thank you I discipline project to be around to get it okay thank you um and there we 'll move on to finding one re here would seem welcome so this reports on page 29 good morning well thank you again for the chance to present our update for the month now there 's just a couple of things I 'll touch on then I 'll hand over to Aaron to talk through a couple of the really kind and give you a video to finish off today first of all you 'll see on page one of our report we 've obviously exercised our community board delegations we 've approved the two toilets at the rota cow who at rotor reserve and Erin will talk about that shortly we 've put some no stopping restrictions and on Helmut Lang and obviously look today discretionary response fund as well there 's just a couple of things to just note for your attention firstly the jelly Park recreational sport center that 's construction still underway all the redevelopment Lea and a follow up from our last meeting was that our staff would send around some information to you after Jimmy 's request out on that timeline so that 's all going to plan I was obviously got the Jeffrey 's air reserve replacement suction tank coming up shortly as well and I hope that said our meeting on the 20th of August they had alongside some work around the Glenn Dobie residents association a request so we 're working through that as well we 've had quite a which has been really good you will see and decision surfaces been just the highlight of a couple of them that of the air and you touch on the monarch butterfly stuff shortly which was quite interesting as I mentioned in our last meeting we had the community service awards as well about it two days before we presented last time again we 've just formally put that into the report for you it was a really fantastic occasion and we 've had really good feedback since so we 're really delighted with their I might pass over to Erin there to talk about the low key yeah thank you so that like vertical toilets so this is a very it 's an increasingly popular reserved half of it is what was the Maori council just to the jetski Lake about 18 months ago the issue still we 're around public kind of misbehaved here in a way there 's a little bit of anti-social behaviour and what have you this past summer it 's just kind of exploded in popularity on a really nice day because of the recreational community with because it 's a it 's a lake it 's fresh water the the the quality is absolutely superb it 's a very safe place for families to go and you know enjoy a little bit of water recreation there so there 's a lot of other in clothes that they use that area the the recreational Reserve has now got proposed a toilets to be installed so it 's from about that health aspect that the facilities he 'd be improved currently they 're just it 's just all too loose little theater so there 's two sites there are about 700 metres of that so therefore there needs to be the two toilets then they the staff are asking that the toilets be connected to the main services for electricity I mean so therefore there 's a lot of there 's a high cost for the civil works construction we 've asked that staff go back and get firmer numbers on those estimates when they came hopefully they 'll come back soon in the meantime with us that this coming spring and summer that adequate measures recreation groups and that type of thing as best as possible yeah so one of the public forums I mentioned earlier was around monarch butterflies and you probably think what on earth is someone coming I want to talk about monarch butterflies about but we had Vicki still come along and present to us on a lot of work she 's doing in her own capacity around I guess their ability to can to maintain that population and some of our parts and what she 'd done is a bit of research around up and and literally going on the mornings and Counting and the evenings as well and she determined that this quite a few issues particularly in Boone side Park around their ability to be sustainable and so we 've referred that part staff to work with her on but we just thought would bring it to your attention a really high level it was quite a fascinating one and in terms of rodents and that type of stuff but you 'll see on the left of that presentation up via these metal sheet bandings that they 've do the same at the inside so quite a cost-effective measure and to sort of mitigate something but it 's just one of those points I guess where we 've got someone actively involved in the community giving up their time to do it and it was kind of adding real value to to what we do so we wanted to bring it to your attention so Erin will finish off by talking about the group of the month and then we can take questions Chinese Church it was about 25 in the congregation since then though they 've grown the the groups now based it to xx Greer 's road and brunoise so it 's opposite Jerry Bromley 's electorate office the physical location of the the church is actually popular in work ward now find the representation review however most of the congregation do come from and the organization played a significant role in the aftermath of the 2011 earthquake they took on responsibility of looking after me needs of families in of the victims and the CTV building who came from overseas they provided accommodation food and at the church the photo on the right is actually a displaced boulder from the port hills which local council staff and sira staff organized to meet a little bit to the church it 's now placed on the corner of the site and as a memorial for the victims of the earthquake and just boy there 's also a time capsule buried and that 's due to be lifted I guess it 's called I think it 's October 20 39 the church provides a variety of activities and programs not just to the Chinese community people of the community but also a weekly community English language class there 's a weekly older adults education program with about 60 people attending each week there 's those angels ages 15 to 19 years old and there 's also a Christmas and a car park which is a delivery of goodie bags at Christmas plan to the local community that 's coming up in a video next the there 's a variety of youth activities tuition and peer support this is a Friday night youth program leadership program basic basketball group are starting in this past year is targeted at young people who don 't have an interest in sport or recreation but are keen on computers and arts so they created the Creative Media Group who this video that we 're gonna show you [Music] Christmas on the car park this year was great we 've done it a few years and it 's our chance to take the message the true message of Christmas outside the walls of the church share with our neighbors and it was just great to see the joy and the kids faces and their parents and it was just wonderful [Music] laughter house as a ninja the same time one way again SEC mentor Tsuyoshi way finish up here man Ichi anchor cha this is or Rancho Hightower Finch a night for some alfalfa juice another balance of human itchy after why L feel itchy that a salty dimension being so South India Christmas in the carpet is really brings the merry vector to the Christmas like Merry Christmas and I think kids really show that they 're so joyful you see them lining thing goes on you know they 're really enjoying it and the bouncy castle just seeing the joy in the kids face I mean that 's Christmas in the car park for me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you that 's lovely these live in a shop just picking up on the combined very informative thank you very much to the staff for coming along it was a excellent ximena the the tech way for Phil our board was I guess around the successful objection to the application of an off license at record Street the last year so now the community members that were very involved in that process of now gone to other areas of the city and helping support other members of the community around there so my takeaway from the vicinity last night was probably for boards to stay within the 204 section 204 and speak Tov the legislation and support the community and instead of submitting evidence Oh instead of bringing evidence just making a submission in support of the community keeps things relatively dry and then you support the other communities that the the solution okay thank you very much indeed very full report and just out of time now so thank you very much indeed um Aaron 's going to move it and refs going to see conduct yeah put that we received report those in favor please say aye those opposed carried thank you very much you dated below is stunning thank you in big spatula is it a good thing or a bad thing okay we 'll talk loudly right yes yep this is on page five of your workspace where his winter gone but this morning we have got her and well it 's a report with lots of things that have gone on over the last month and a variety of issues but no pates in it so I want to bring up this morning and just highlight some things so far Wow heroic restoration Papa Bravo anchora wolf re working group and the air our service center so if we start with the WHA heroic restoration and the out peacock will reserve it 's quite a challenging hitting there but this is an amazing project that goes Corrections to restore a carved wire on now the water are is that that that up there that 's got to treat two things on the side of it and then over the stoppers as a plant that sort of provides a roof to it but it 's an amazing carving and the original waha row was created as part of a turning point to doesn 't care to be white AHA means to celebrate the millennium so there was one there but it was deteriorating and disrepair so this has been repaired over the last three or four years and it was rededicated on on the 26th of July but the important part about it was that it was done with the wrister with them with the with the prisoner who Department of Corrections who worked on this many thousands of hours to do it and who is very proud of his work that he 's done now that that is an entrance to a cultural garden and it contains plants of cultural value particularly medicinal plants and back in two thousand and two thousand when this was originally 20 years though the gardens have absolutely flourished was planted by the community with land care assistance and angela has been involved throughout this long period of time so it 's great to see that come to fruition so the next one is the APA wolf know the aircar wolf features and a lot of fun a lot of photographs as you can see they 're beautiful part and historic wolf and things but we have have a few issues around it that everybody wants to be honest at the same time and that we have also got commercial users recreational users in the public using it so there 's been an issue a few issues with with things on earth that shouldn 't be there so we 've been having a bit of a tidy up and there 's been fish crates and things that we 've been asked to remove from it and we 've also implementing some floats smoke-free signage and print and preparation for the cruise ship season historically tourists get off the boat and they light up immediately so we would just like to them light up as soon as they get off it so we 're looking at also smoke-free signs around the other areas of the town as well so that was really triggered by a recent highlighting of it through your council process and we we looked at what we had in a car are and where we should implement that the next one is about Armistice Day the hundredth anniversary now this beautiful War Memorial is owned by the community it 's one of a few in New Zealand it 's managed by a particular committee a reserve a War Memorial Committee of dedicated people we have restored it and it cost about nine hundred thousand dollars to repair it following the earthquakes we found the funding ourselves and did that repair with the project manager and so Armistice Day is coming up on the 11th 11th and November and we they asked us for some funding and we have provided them with some funding and we 've also written and we 'll run it with 1,000 or 1,500 and we are underwriting it for a further thousand dollars to have you have a look at it is the center of the town magnificent maintained beautifully duplicatable star garden standards it 's just an amazing setting in the town and this is a good story as well this is you know we listen to the radio at the moment and there was so many poor stories about the council and I feel like hiding under the table this is one of those stories where we had a lot of trouble of getting this group over the line they were continually too satisfied what was with what was going on and suddenly something happened and we found the right people for that team to work with and council and they now have got a sound working relationship between the Christchurch City Council and the community just how they should be happening each respecting each other and getting on with the job and they 've had a couple of working bees already it is an old cemetery there are 86 identified broken him stones her appear in restoration not owned by families now because those families are well gone but it may cost planning for a memorial entrance and are going for counsel consent so that 's a good story a great story about another partnership that has just gone so well from a disorganized I mean from a disgruntled group to something that 's positive and a good story to tell and the last one is reopening of a super center occur I 'll soon sinning and this is amazing story to its we 're going to get our service center back for us so this is out before my every post office it was built in 1914 and was and as a replacement of an earlier building ant building built in 1856 so it was it 's just a large domestic building but the interior still has original decorative plaster and moldings and plaster on the walls and it 's got a polished wall of polished architraves windows and door frames so it is a magnificent tile building just alongside the wall more oil the woman whales on the left over the other side of the road is the the museum and the the old bank building so it 's the that that area the service center moves back to it on tomorrow the third and the opening ceremony is on the 8th of August from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. so there are some reasons or not reasons businesses that will go into that building echo a district promotions I think is going into one of the rooms civil defense of might ask local civil defense team in Decorah might have some space here as well and new zealand proposed are just working through the proposal at the moment to go into the the right hand side there the no knots on the writers in the middle of the building but now the colors look a bit different but they are based on the on the colors that the building was it was early on pages earlier on so it 's got a clock there in the middle up the steps there an old clock that has been nurtured and managed over the years and this back up and ticking away so we 're very pleased to have our service center opened again and it has some new moderns a about to drive I won 't have to drive to town council staff might not have to drive out to our are either they 'll just link up and and meet with us as appropriate so we look forward to using it and having our first meeting in there later in the year so that 's and the highlights that I 've just a few things that were picked out everything of course is important in this but I just love for community to hear the lovely stories that we do here at these mornings that come and we should be looking at how we can get our our community involved and some of these students that are going on thanks very much Pam so any questions Queen um thank you just over eight point three Pam smoke-free I can what a smoke-free and public places policy this already includes the precincts around our facilities yes that 's already there with relation to the the service center is and the museum what 's the wharf and the library I 'm sure we can work with smoke-free Canterbury and the other that we 've had a lot of success um along with the cycling actually we are recognized nationally for our extension over our smoke-free and public places policy in the way we 're going about it so if you would like us to set up some yeah we 'd love it we 'd love that discussion the issue that we have got is that what a cruise ship person what a tourist as you know what smoke-free so we need to perhaps convey that in the appropriate communicate with the cruise lines so when you know a cruise ship berths passengers receiver you know super all that announcements so that could be just part of you know the understanding where they come in into christchurch Littleton I thought that you know these policies exist okay thank you and thank you very much and date I had one question okay sorry any one six six point three it 's reported that one of the dictation asked that last instructions only what people removed I wasn 't quite clear from pears presentation but that is being done and also just wanted to whether that 's assistant counsel management yoni I think that this was a recommendation that the board made and that was up to the council to implement it and it wasn 't the the one that I was referring to in my presentation here this morning this is a much larger issue that we have got with the M with the black cat and the users of the wharf so it 's it 's going through a process and the board has recommended that all of those structures that are not well those structures that are illegal that haven 't been consented be removed from the wharf we haven 't actually heard back from black cat how they received that information but that was the decision that was made and we need to work through that now okay so we just clarify is that is it up to the community forward to take that sort of enforcement action or decision or is that something that council management should be doing that 's council we 're not doing into council doing it council staff for addressing it so and our council it I 'm not aware of a time frame but it is it is being in full I 'm aware that it 's being enforced right very last question Phil because we 're no it 's so quick you may have well if you 're gonna say this to Vicki but I just want to thank Pam and the board especially for the support and your communities while our heritage buildings just so much edge to the quaintness and I 'm sorry we can 't come to the opening I think we 've got other meetings on p.m. but clearly your book and it 's just when you go to their Corral it just it stands out so that 's thank you it 's great on the boards for half in the community thank you so we 've moved ten milliseconds at the end I 'll put the report those are they listen I I supposed to carried and welcome to your emails might been warm welcome blank on today just to remind people to wear their red and black tomorrow yes so to but tomorrow 's at work days putting the challenge out there and now I 'd like to invite this okay so bear with Ward t5 good morning Lee Antigone forth thank you in council catalyst the first one obviously is a delicate Umbridge safety concerns the community came to us the recent Association etc and said this from big concerns about safety and accidents that 's Nexus and just recently so we 're actually working with them and we have an on-site meeting with an engineer plant so it 's something we 're looking at at the moment well the new broken clock towers you probably know it 's hence kept holding the roundup for quite a long time and we now actually sing some action which is great the faces you can see the top to our face they 've been taken out and they have to be repaired so I guess it 's a pretty old type of system so it 'll take a while but there has been some damage found in the actual sound building itself and that 's been repaired so it looks like it 's about a year-long job behind excuse me the Brighton Pier fixed and I just must tell you that in the first month it was open after it was opened again we had eight thousand plus people in the first month and the numbers are building up again which is great to see something positive happening again the tree removal set New Brighton Park this has been an ongoing issue for quite a while we had an it we had a councillor Burris come down just recently and had a look at the trees and I think I mentioned at a previous meeting are quite concerned about 30-odd trees coming down and this stage there the arborist seemed to think there could be up to a hundred that need to come down I think we 've scaled there back now to the most urgent ones which is about nine but it 's a big concern because a lot of the trees that is dying are on the other side of the walkway and they 've died not from salt intrusion through the ground but they 're the water 's coming in on particularly high tides and into obviously concede damage to the East Ridge that 's erosion and it 's obviously a big issue but it 's a concern we 're leading blues in trees further own with the in the salt water because you know so what is just as I said it 's just sitting there for up to a week after a big event I 'd so we 'd love to work forward that one it 's just going ongoing saga and we don 't seem to be getting anywhere with it this one is this is the fall short this is a combined thing with them it 's got B see a landscape public out and they 're getting together to try to find out what they can do we 'll come up some ideas what they can do with their particular area as you know it 's always been bit untidy it 's where we have the Anzac Day so the idea is to see what they can do and see what improvements can be made the community board will some of the members are working with that as well oh event I 've definitely really chilly Sunday one of the few cold days we have down here but it it was a cracker day as far as people coming along and Glen was there and Joan I picked all the community board and councils were there great turnout as you can see there we had that but we 've got a picnic on the other side of the road there 's been a steady stream of people coming to the regenerate hub a lot of people are not going because they think nothing 's going to happen and that 's quite sad really and I 'm having to kind of almost knock on doors and convince people to come along I think it 's because it 's been so long winded there 's bill despondency in the area but again at the same time there are people coming along so and that 's why I think you know going on a bit further than that the community needs some quick wins you know this is not a lot of hoping out there at the moment which is is quite sad other one here is um obviously the issue of sounds sure and as you probably all know rum you know this case is the where people can 't build and there 's still people there who haven 't been able to build and still with a lot of money tied up in their sections and consenting and all this stuff and can 't build and I don 't know how you 'd feel but if you had a lot of money tied up and you don 't know how you can get out of the out of this position because you cannot build you cannot sell your section and your 300,000 down so there was a case as you know ever and reckless last week wheat for the person who was trying to build but it didn 't really set an example which was probably disappointing so look at something I think it 's a council the community board counsel and Rison 's have got to work together and get some of these things fixed there 's too many half-finished projects or projects that aren 't going anywhere at the why I think the numbers are down at the regenerate they could be a lot more because you know one of the things you 've got to do out there is give people some hope and we 're not we 're not doing that we 're not getting projects finished people want to know they 've got a future for the families themselves and also hope so there 's a two most important things future and hope if we can give them a better that will move forward but until we get something sorted out East Ridge South Pride and South Shore building we 're going to have this fleshing it 's not the right way to move forward so I 'm not sure the right way forward I don 't know what it is but we have to work together somehow and hit at least some of these issues solved otherwise we 're going to be coming back to this meeting all the time talking about the same things it 's about it thank you thank you sorry not Sara thank you thanks Tim I 'm just wondering if 's always I mean across the city there 's a never-ending list of things that need doing but you know we 've opened Toyota Kiwi to the piers but as you 've got your brand new playground the hot water problems are on the way yes we 're not celebrating that enough if you think that people know we 're not doing anything for the year I cannot speak highly enough about those they 're wonderful they are but it 's but those things up like pluses but when you start playing with people 's lives livelihoods yeah that 's the difference because the message you 're saying is that people feel like we 're not doing anything no no I 'm probably okay no Creek there yeah there is great things happening in the yeah Paul look at the polls the schools you know there is some great things happening I 'm not talking about that those are pluses but there are some minuses and minuses are yeah so don 't get me wrong with people are very thankful for those and there was hope on that respect but things actually actually affect like loans insurance it 's a different issue to what you 're talking about yeah very very grateful and very thankful you won 't get anybody who will say anything against those things I think maybe I mean is the regeneration stuff that actually that those sort of coastal hazards issues a district plan getting that sorted it was a coastal business business where seem to be loggerheads over the east region South Brighton and in South Shore and we 've got this building issue no no it 's our prawns house you 'll probably have the most issues at the moment yeah so no she 's already cooled off I 'm not really referring to the whole East I 'm referring to a particular area but there is a process that 's going on there so we 've got the but a but a methodology has been devised by the community for the community and what the community around how we engage on these really tough issues because they 're not easy you know and I don 't think that these are there 's a the future and the the whole approach around adaptive management means shared knowledge shared understanding and a shared vision for the future but also a really powerful capacity within a community to adapt and change direction because we don 't actually know what the future holds and it 's a vulnerable environment on both sides of the estuary although I 'd rather be on your side than on the other side maturity I mean the reasons themselves most of lived day-to-day and this is what 's affecting them at day to day and you know I know we 're talking about the future I totally understand that and I know that 's what we 're working towards but you know I 'm talking at grain level I 'm talking with the residents all the time this is what I 'm hearing now and I 'd if I talk to them a lot to you it 's not I just don 't feel like they 're moving forward I mean let aside what you said before about the good things that are happening but the people that are fakes do we insurance industry to decide the future of [Music] coastally environment or environments and Christchurch no but but do we have to work with the insurance industry yes we do we do because they are going to be doing their own assessments they are going to be determining what is vulnerable they are going to be determining what they 're going to charge by way of excesses and what they 're going to charge for premiums and they are going to decide not to cover some things so we need to we need to be quite collaborative in the space the reinsurance have been looking at this for a very very long time to be honest they 're probably never heard of Christchurch before September 2010 but they do now and they 're very aware of multiple hazards so it 's not just one hazard it 's multiple hazards in heaven conversations with communities that are already still stressed but cause of the effects of the earthquakes which are still not resolved is a very very tricky thing to do which is why we 've gone for a co designed collaboration be I hope a template for the rest of New Zealand for dealing with coastal environments but you know we 're on a journey and we 're when when where where are we way down the track but not very far down the track so I 'm extremely hopeful that the model that we 've developed will actually really help develop understanding about those environments but how you build communities that are capable of acceptance of the need to change when that change occurs and that may be many many many years in the future and another generation but we have to set it up now for those decision-making environments to exist is we 've got a temporary bunt fixing protecting people and South Shore well insurance companies don 't recognise temporary as a real fix so that 's one of the issues we 've got as well yep and these are the issues which we 'll be able to be resolved over over time as we look at the different components I mean you know as well as I do that the entire history environment is not the same certainly this but is different on the on the beach side with an accreting Beach so there are there are multiple issues that need to be resolved down there and it 's not just a one-size-fits-all solution I think you know because we the people don 't have been living with it for so long it 's just a shift frustration of it 's been getting harder and harder and yeah I think since we 're getting done and this one I 'm quite disappointed that there should be more people going to this regenerate hug they are going but because they think nothing 's gonna happen that 's a terrible attitude to have in this one unfortunately some people have yeah no but at Sierra 's point was writers that it 's communication communication and and I do understand that there is some communication really to be lifted in the next week or so so to really drive things help people understand the environment that they 're living in and the challenges of resolving some of those issues for the future it is a hard area but I 'm not but we 're absolutely with them and we don 't want to have the insurance industry make decisions for the future we want to work with the insurance industry but primarily we want to work with communities so that they understand they have to be addictive living in their environment could happen okay and I 'm quite clear you know I said before there are some great things happening in our side of town the antastic folks and don 't get me wrong but you know we 've good things we 've also got some bad things try to keep it in balance here but you cannot forget that there 's with the good things there 's also some brief difficulties for people yep so it 's not I 'm not doing a moan I 'm not saying there are issues out there and there 's some great things happening and I 'm also trying to say that that we do hear those we 're very aware of them and we really do want to enable communities to take control of what our major decisions that are going to it 's not just in your area but on the other side of the history as well and then all around the banks for lunch worth so I 'm in actually New Zealand yeah I 'm sorry but I 've kind of overdone it but just that 's because the wheels turn so slowly but there 's so much investigative needs to be done I know in Studies on this area for years so it 's about conveying that to the people which is being done but you can 't see it yet yes there is work and we 've all been briefed on work that 's been done and that is going to be going out into the community for them to be looking at and the next couple of weeks so no confusion in the community yes he founded up the regeneration strategy and you know regenerate Christchurch is leading the work the advantage of a regeneration strategy is that we have the the ability to change aspects of our district plan through a regeneration plan so it is a better approach it is a way more engaged Environment Court so that 's it 's a much better planning environment for actually dealing with challenging issues where we 're looking to the future and not just looking at the present-day environment thank you thanks very much thank you sorry dear I just the impetus ones might one hello is that okay yep I mean sorry I forgot that you were there and it 's um well several people have so I just want to just mr. price I think the idea of setting up local spaces where people can go and get information is a really positive so as they 're sitting up local shops or pop-up shops pop-up spaces in communities where people can go is actually really cool that I think we should be considering doing more of it but it 's whatever that 's not I think that 's that 's why they 've got their you know it was I just wasn 't ready good idea yes okay regenerate Karachi which has done that right um spread and Kashmir community board you noticed in the report that we need to the need to get with the community a few events and activities taking them by surprise the gay host Road bridge we 've just got a bit of a discrepancy between the residents experience and the engineer 's report on that so we have to that 's why we 're having the on-site meeting and with the Aven site girls and surely boys owning while the ministries come out with the interim zone the preference is still for certainty so it 's a little bit like what we 've been talking about over the South that 's true in South New Brighton residents want certainty impermanence in a difficult situation so you could you could say really that that you know that lack of certainty isn 't confined to to one place people want to know post-quake with a stand and anything that 's basically I think true for for many over the so moved by Glenn 's thickened up by Aaron I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's Carrie now we have sprayed in Kashmir community board here at at I just wanted talked about the Manik butterflies we 've had the same person in our ward commenting about the number of butterflies that have been killed and we 've given the project two hundred and fifty dollars from our off the ground fund to ring the relevant trees with steel to stop the rats getting up and killing the butterflies we have like other places do significant trees in various perhaps of our ward that house the butterflies over winter and it 's been quite apparent that they 're not there this winter I just want to comment briefly before we start on the the grants it 's just it 's just the difference between a small award and a smaller board area sorry and the row here of the larger boards is that our grants took up a page this year and it used to be several pages and we do miss those projects in those areas and those suburbs that we have lost and but we still contribute for instance to amps Christchurch South community gardens trust who 's over the way in central now but whose work benefits our more redrawing of the bear the board areas become more import we are in the middle of the of the long standing river bank stabilization program and the water engineers came to see us again as they always do to present brilliantly as they always do on the changes that are going to be occurring further down the history of our in terms of our bank stabilization it is remarkable some of the transistors are occurring to the history the widening of the river is a really apparent and some of our areas now and it demonstrates how the rivers were deliberately narrowed and how that has contributed to the flooding that has occurred in recent years and the widening of the river gives it much more natural appearance when we walked from the service center at beacon them over to look at the river the river was tumbling down between its banks and looked very that doesn 't look as natural as it 's going to look because of the rocks that they have put in to stabilize the banks but growth of the of the plantings will make super city you almost felt as though you could have peace occasion it not me of course but in the kayak and have a race down the river and the outward appearance of the river is much more natural and we 're seeing that we were all really seeing the benefits of it it 's a pity that we can 't even make them wider in some areas some of our rivers of course drains instead of being a natural looking river it 'll be interesting to see if and when they do changes for instance and the spreads and domain it would be interesting to see it looking with reference to it some the banks and the spray-tanned domain it goes anywhere near there but it 's a pleasure to help the drainage guys during the presentation on this and a consultation and the community generally speaking responds really well with the drainage guys respond they also consult with us on their plantings have board favors and native tree plantings and especially the noble tree if we can get a tote roll packet Aaron we will and we have and apropos of that we often see far too often actually contractors putting in random trees and random places on their riverbanks they just appear and they 've got no there 's no design or seeming intent and one Cypress appears down he 's got near the edge grow preserve the edge grow preserve is recent than the low Kashmir residents Association has recently become the criteria P of the Ashgrove reserve and now restoring the native plantings in it and doing such a good job and there are three calorie in there for God 's sake and so they 're working really hard in there and all of a sudden the Cypress appears and they asked why and we had a great response from the arborist who really as head the Cypress removed but I don 't know why those random plantings occur well we launched on July the 4th the age-friendly sprayed in Kashmir project when I hear the word say Trinity I want to whisk my head gently on the DS and have a quiet doze that 's what the senior emanates from Wellington and the senior change it I made an introductory remarks that referred to the fact that this generation that is aging now are the generation that invented sex drugs and rock and roll and and this is a generation that was a generation when generations weren 't talked about in the and when this group were born and post-world War two generations weren 't remarked on teenagers didn 't exist generations now exist ad infinitum and this generation isn 't going to tolerate the patronizing crap that gets delivered to older people I have great hope that this generation makes a nuisance of it and as they have done before and I 'm hoping that they 'll lead the way for the aging generations to come of which you are all members and that they will cause a bit of a stir in our neighborhood to ensure that aging is not treated the way it has been in the past and just treated as inevitable and bold and it 's actually and I can tell you from firsthand experience so we did have we had Diane Turner from the senior citizens office and to the audience but I 'm hoping that an ends they did a great job and it was great to have them there but I am hoping that the group when it 's convened and starts at work starts to think adventurously and was excitement about the aging and just that part there yesterday at and there were people there from here the housing network had case level Smith speaking about the aging and rental properties and the decline and homeownership from the beginning of the century 2000 to now is startling and its most startling in the 40 to 45 days period so the housing issues thank God the Christchurch City Council of all local bodies leads in talking about housing and social housing and I 'm really personally very grateful for them and the spreadin commit cashmere we used to have for instance in the Benton Barrington Park but the staff recognized and the staff recognized this before we elected members probably that no longer look like an event that was led by the community and was an amaz supporter of community development they recognized that they that becoming increasingly commercial and there was no longer groups of people in enjoying community so they 've that we 've we 've can that particular event but ask the community to think of events that they appear about and that would support community development in their area and to support that the community development staff have a get go get set go workshop to talk to community groups about community development and about event management and we 've had considerable success in the for instance the rally community in developing the the project around the basketball lights and and making the Hoenn atheist a much larger event and the rugby league has become involved and including the Pacific Festival and the schools in that area have become involved and the sports in that area have become involved because the the cultural event that 's held for schools is too expensive for them it 's too expensive for them so they are developing their own program around you know Fiesta and the community development team and our Ward working to support their energy and drive that 's coming from the community and I actually must get to go to one of those and workshops myself and actually learn something about it too weird the community board pamphlet is being developed after melds Ned for six years I think and will be going out with us with the second rates notice and will no doubt after people have sat down quietly on receiving their rates notice and might become more conscious in terms of reading something will no doubt be taken up with interest by the people who receive it and the and the final thing on the same day is the citizens sorry as the age-friendly we presented to Jeremy agar of the Summit Road Society in their ears a very large tick for 45,000 for predator-free and we were absolutely delighted jeremy had a tear in his eye he has worked so hard on this project it was led by him the Summit Road Society was originally a bit thoughtful about the effort it might take and whether they could find the financing for it it requires really good statistical collecting but on their the weekend after Jeremy got took over 200 people at a workshop it 's in Martin 's school on how to become predator free it 's a triumph in our area I know it 's a triumph elsewhere in Canterbury but an area we 've taken this issue on at a personal level and we are thrilled with the results thrilled with the Summit Road society very proud of Jeremy 's work in the work that he 's put into the Summit Road society and the wider community everywhere on predator-free and there are some of the kids as well we 've got some t-shirts for a separate prize on how on drawing designer to design a t-shirt and they 've got a separate prizes on the designs of their t-shirts and about predator-free so and said it the most this is interesting to me you 'd like to make that and then just note yen and we didn 't take time you know at the time we only took our time we didn 't take up time no no we 're all natural you stopped it did on two minutes thank you but congratulations to with the community about how they can take control of things that sir it 's it 's wonderful so really congratulations very much felt willing Karen look thank you for your afford and you 've touched on I guess some quite high level strategic issues term if it comes to older people and short of housing began affordable and it 's just how and preps and you City acknowledge them counsel of a strong history in their social we Algeria I 'm just wondering well it considering how in fact we have all this joined up the work that our Housing Committee do and Jim was at the seminar yesterday to and and that the group that the age friendly group in Kashmir and then of course what we really need is that as the case they will said this how in fact we make sure that the silos its central government level are broken down so every government department is involved with this issue but pret set something for future exploration so we actually become strategic about this it was first brought to my attention as the ebony Park not actually 100% confirm that it was red because you brought us those questions about water the same woman came in the outboard area and she is very firm that it is red because they wings are left and the bodies are gone even even though I know she gave us bonus but even though staff come because if they have so do they think it is really and the other thing is we need to get the feedback on we know the rings are actually working and because seems to be that it 's citywide it is so you 've got some rating you 've got Emily Park in Boone side part just the three that have been noted no more bacon and plaques got a huge Manik butterfly dreams no the rest don 't recognize the wood boundaries no what I 'm saying is that and it could actually be it could actually be an aftermath it 's equate as well because we did have a huge rich explosion of population in the CBD and then probably moving outwards there used to be a really big tree and Terrace Road it was a big tree he was monarchs on it I don 't know if they still do you think Pauline we should get a staff members just hanging around doing nothing and no I do I 'm just trying to work out with the chief executive as is there a committee that this can get a report back to so that I mean this work there 's a working group going on so there 's a working group but then Council so it is being addressed ok would be the environment we could have a monarch yes year please quit yeah ok so so is it possible to arrange a briefing for the for the SE committee just on we 're the programs up to been involved in this issue and so and we 'd be good to take him to those people who already have some knowledge liya yeah currently there is a series of group with and council that is addressing this yeah so we 'll just get an update report through to a tee and then we can refer it to all of the yep okay thank you hey Frank you thank you thank you very much thank you we 've moving right along so it 's been moved by term seconded by Phil I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's careful okay and the next one is the poppin ariannus community board go the Crusaders just quietly okay so I 'll make very good riddle at yep thank you very much for having us along today I will look at the Swami thank you not a lot actually I just want to say that I think that the fenders and why Mary here would board has set a very high bar would be presentations today but quite clearly has too much time on their hands and possibly too much budget so yeah look there 's a lot happening in the community at the moment with community groups and youth agencies in the area one organization that we have a lot to do with and has a lot to do with us is the Papa new youth development which continues to provide brilliant programs order ho the Belfast community Network and North City and py Jesus standout youth facility in Christchurch and it was built in partnership which of course is really important and it strengthens the the organization and those involved it was a partnership 11 years ago between the Christchurch City Council and the Anglican Church and they provide within PYD for the youth in the area a craft room radio station a climbing wall basketball courts computer Suites PlayStation room and recording studios so it 's a really fantastic facility for the youth in our area and they 're very well connected as well and well respected and trusted because that 's a really important part of the relationship they have a new program at PYD it 's group PR k which is ascend into new heights and it offers breakfast and mentoring sessions along with the life skills program called legacy and it operates out of case Brook Intermediate School and it also works together with some reasonably high-profile sports people which is a great connection to have two of the things happening in our ward at the moment is sand albans park and pavilion project the pavilion is ahead well but the project is overall behind but only because of the wet weather and what the effect is on the on the grass growing and I mean you could canoe out there at one stage last month but the pavilion is just about done and we 've got a board visit to the pavilion this Friday and this was put together the program was developed the building was was signed off after talking to groups in the area and finding out what they needed in the building and that was a really good process I think the board kind of went yeah we need changing rooms here we need a kitchen but actually when we talked to the groups it was clear that space could be better utilized so that was a really good project or process as well don 't talk to me about color right just moving on drawing a discreet veil over these sand all that sparkly and color scheme will move to the next image which really we 're still getting that wealth not still youth and our Ward as well and I have to say that in my Norrish the Deputy Chair has really picked up you know the mantle on on the youth and our she understood I vote for Paula oh yeah right so she is very proactive in the area of youth engagement and we 're seeing this with these two that came to see us Travis Baldwin and Kaylin Lewis talked about what a huge difference in their lives this project made going on the spirit of adventure trophy and I think it was Travis 's mum was there and and she said that she saw a really amazing positive change in Travis came back from it just did she say it 's keeping his room tidy I think the space that they had on the on the boat was so small that they had to we really had to keep it tight but you know these young people come and talk to us they put together a presentation and they look us straight in the eye and I think most of the board would agree that this is one on the board is hearing that feedback from the young people in our ward a lot of planting going on in the ward at the moment this is the Matariki dawn planting that was on the 15th of July Alton irui her and yeah again very wet I mean it 's been a wet last few weeks actually and then we had some more planting at the carpenter high Creek and that was with the University of Florida students which got a bit of media coverage as well and another planting day on the 25th and that 's board member John stringer on the top right there he went along to represent the board who worked with the student army on this that 's it so a couple of things just I wanted to raise before we finish there are two main but support going on and the water at the moment as far as consultation goes the first one is the Prem third Street downstream effects management plant project now unless it 's been sent to all submitters and look I have to say we have found that there matters so we 're just following up where that gap is and why that happened we received 407 submissions in total and on August the 6th which is next Monday the community board is giving the submitters and we 'll hear from submitters who said they 'd like to be heard the process here is that there is an independent engineering expert dr. Shane Turner he 's going to attend the meeting on Monday he will then draft a report which will be referred to you as councillors and will then proceed to a council decision but that decision will be consulted on again within the community something that we 're making very clear in all of our communications at the moment is that we are something above and beyond what is normally required for a project like this and that 's because we know how important this project is to everyone in the ward and how controversial it is let 's be frank that 's it 's getting a bit of coverage and there are we 're not going to please everyone on this we know that but we condition and the designation for the road does make clear that the board or the council has to consider mitigation for this project so it 's actually part of the designation so we think that that is proceeding the way it should at the moment the other one is the bus thank you the bus priority on maintenance Road and that is quite I don 't to use the word thought it is a controversial part of one of the controversial consultations in our ward at the moment as well there 's been some reports on removal of parking and things like that and as you will know that 's often an issue that sort of gets people going but that 's about all at the moment we are finding that there is a huge pressure on our ward staff they are all working extremely hard helping with the newsletter helping with the inquiries that we 're getting and the engagement that we 're getting from members of the community we have made clear as a board that if there are concerns or issues around workload that that needs to it comes to these important consultations and engage with the community and so we want to make sure that that doesn 't happen any more than it is at the moment and I just had a question which is in relation to a different consultation so I 'm really pleased to see that the community boards engaging at the same time as they can on the changes to the bus route which was part of a successful campaign I think by the retirement village and their to get the bus rerouted with the changes that are happening in the area to ensure that older people could catch the bus and staff could catch the bus to blitzer it 's good but why they know but no bus stops signs outside the shops that I go to I 'm down on this road cherlene currently yeah surely you 're not going to take the parking outside that little bit of shops and put a bus stop here ie that is part of the process in the suggestion at the moment but that is not but that 's our consultation yes so for the bus stop we didn 't we were presented with that as the consultation or the the project that they will consult a lot but it 's it 's our part of the project I understand that in the community board to be perfectly honest the community board was unaware that there would be that number of parks or indeed any parts removed from there we do have a little bit of good well we have much concern actually about this consultation we feel that it is we are consulting whether you can at the same time but it seems confused and in my opinion anyway and some of the community aren 't aware of who 's consulting on which button to whom they send their information to as far as the loss of the parking goes and I think the councillors might like to speak on the so know that Mike Davidson 's being engaged with the businesses down there we 've been back through the presentation that we had at the community board and I have checked with the staff we do not recall being told that from outside those shops and eight car parks equates to the entire length of those shops just about so I 've been down here as well but I mean we the community board will have delegation over there so we 're not going to just go along with you hang on hang on oh but this is what this is what I 'm confused about was the community board did the community board actually sign off on the poll to build himself not not so cannot anyone tell me why that was the case because it 's the community boards role to sign off on the consultation that we didn 't delegate or the kind we don 't have the power to delegate that to he can as I understood it from the joint committees point public transport committees perspective it was agreed that it would be excellent to consult the community at the same time that doesn 't mean that you delegate the decision-making to someone else so who decided the who decided what went out to the public as far as the location of the bus stops the we didn 't see the final concentrations your briefing from 18 Oh nobody 's and and we were not as early as his said we were not made aware that there was going to be carpark losses outside those businesses we knew that the obese and can fat loss is possibly on Road and it was not brought to our attention in especially not debt number so there seems to have been some sort of a glitch to you well we 're we have delegation and Christine 's going to follow this up from a staff perspective it 's video perspective today I think what is really important here to and I 'm so glad you phrased it that it came to us essentially signed and sealed and ready to go and actually signed and sealed without the full information so when we as board members enter as our counselors engage with residents either face-to-face or via email it is very embarrassing to be informed of something of which we are unaware by the people who are affected by it so yeah there 's certainly a problem in the process staff perspective but we will be from I just saw I saw the signs yeah it is a shopping area that I go to frequently one very good coffee at Martha 's cafe and two I often buy flowers at the flower shop you 're right and not that I eat fish and chips very often but they 're very good as well so I 'm just saying it 's a very handy little shopping center but it is completely dependent on parking there are several issues that have come out of this that raise concerns and we are following them okay well that 's my submission thank you um Europe so Tim if I could just Channel Yanni for a couple of minutes well I 'll do a minutes rather than a couple and we frequently get and seen through consultations is a heads up so we get an email saying hey we 're about to go and consult on this this is what the documents are and we don 't get to sign them off as a board I know yo knees been asking and we 've been can it come to us to sign off before it goes out for consultation but usually it doesn 't at least we get it heats up at fair enough heat of time for us to say hey doesn 't mean I have you with us there are some things that wouldn 't go to a community board for sign off this but there are other things that would and this is one that would because it 's absolutely crystal clear it 's the decision-making sits with the keyboard and they should have signed off landscape plans for what we do some of the things that our community for delegating and they don 't come to us first I not I mean if we have to look at what all of them are so anyway Phil don 't LeeAnn I 've raised this issue a number of times but I think it 's time it 's really time that we 've got purification about the process of signing off all the consultations where they go in especially when if for example it 's a community board project whatever the residents survey it 's gotta be so careful when we go out for consultation we do a lot of it so I 'm just surprised that with us when you ask for going to consultation and you ask for submissions there 's another standard to say and if you would like your submission heard or if you would like to be heard but now it seems that this wasn 't done and we 're going out for sending a letter out to say if you 'd like to be here know know what it was was it was it was always communicated that you would be able to speak to your submission the letter is just to confirm the date that time and would you like to book because when you 've got 407 submissions and at the moment I think we 're sitting at around 25 or 30 people coming in to talk we need to essentially have an RSVP system so it was always made clear and all of the collateral and information about the process that people would be able to speak to their submission but surely we would doubling up staff time and the fact of it the trouble I mean and that this is where I 'll go back to signing off on consultation documents the original consultation document didn 't sit out and see that a timeline but it didn 't see it out you know we 're doing this because we 're required to by resource consent condition you know there 's going to be an independent report done office that person 's going to be sitting in on the hearings are we talking about two different things are you talking about Cranford Street yeah so he 's talking about the least of the winter mutters after the submissions were this is Ferg Cranford Street CNC down story that 's what I 'm talking about I beg your pardon sorry yes correct but the dough stream yep the original consultation document didn 't set out what was actually why didn 't set out the why what why are we doing at this particular way right you know that these are independent expert being appointed and blah blah what the Lisa has done has actually set process which wasn 't done in the original consultation document which is good you know that the explanation letter as exact but I think also too because this is such a long process and you 'll all be aware how long the cncs been going we need to be regularly re engaging with your community as well because you can 't send something out 6 7 8 9 months ago and then assume that it 's on people 's radar as that date approaches so that is why having an email tree as well and constantly sending updates I mean the implications for the downstream effects won 't be implemented until there 's been a you know sort of a 30% increase in traffic or something like that as a result of the downstream effects taking place so we 're talking 2020 and beyond so it 's not something that 's going to happen overnight it 's something that 's going to be know that was respect we need to also be ready to implement it or even be implementing it prior to it becoming a problem because the last in an area where the traffic has increased 30% yeah I was quoting from people 's consent but I may be wrong yeah yeah it has to be in before the arterial opens yes mr. ocean yes so we won 't wait for the problem to present itself we have to have it in place before the problem becomes apparent you know that we 're not being active and putting it in place but yeah I thought there were more layers to it there no you 're right there are because there are varying levels of mitigation the example I yeah anyway so um so who Pauline my second dude so I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carrot thank you thank you [Music] right so could we have the horse walk home be restaurant news aboard urinating oh sorry accurately in capsules and I 'll talk about error and you name a waipuna later on anyway gives us great pleasure to present a community board report to you today and we have apart a Metis the recommendation that the not a party the first one is that we deploy the approval under the and under the reserve act to run to reclassify part of deep in pack which is a separate report coming later so I did try to seek guidance earlier in their own check before the meeting the end whether we asked questions and at this that this part of the meeting or or after the opportunity to come to the table when they 're better the reclassification of dentin parkas and is following in the area reports so that 's that 's are you happy with that yes am i heavy with the table now and then we 're going straight on to Denton Park yes so if you just deal with Denton Park at the end of at the end of your presentation that 's fine okay and in the approval of the reclassification so we 'll move on then to the and the next thing is the approval of heavy vehicle restrictions on various roads within their award that something that 's been an issue for quite a number V is actually is the but what we have now is the ability for for the police for example to actually pull over a moving vehicle and issue them with an instant infringement notices so prior to this and it hasn 't been the case you 've actually had the summons somebody to court so we 're very very pleased with that progress and the other thing I just wanted to clarify is the approval to construct two pedestrian pathways on Richmond drainage reserve to adjacent to and there 's a typo there it 's night 's stream school not Knight Street school so we 're very happy to project to progress with that and then Ministry of Education is actually paying for that which is what standing moving on the end of the part I we were going to talk about just like to take this opportunity again to actually think the the panel the hearings panel and the staff that supported the hearings panel on this process and and I 'm sure all the submitters that took part in that by the for or against were very very grateful for the efforts and out so I know I did thank them at the extraordinary meeting but it just take this opportunity now here today to to acknowledge the work of the penny and the staff supporting the penalty other significant term of the next year other significant projects and their board area of the streets and in communities funds projects which they 're um that being processed quite a lot of those are being processed near out there Gary so we 're that 's a work in progress and the other partnerships with community community and organizations is a New Zealand Institute of Sport get set go workshop so I understand that 's being around other boards as well taking part in that Gary so that something that them that we 're really really pleased to run to give people the opportunity and as over 60 students have attended and tailored version their workshops specifically aimed at preparing them for future careers and working in community support our community sport at least so that 's something that 's really really good moving on then to the upper bracket upper record and war memorial as the autist memorial hall so we 're still working with those communities to find resolutions and em way forwards on both of those and warm and Memorial Library and War Memorial Hall and the the very exciting infrastructure project update is NAR Pune why Sports Hub of course and you can see the exciting colored photos is set just a question and that I 'd like to ask if staff are in a both those some stained the the green stained and beams and are they coming from Jade stadium because they look very similar to the ones that were above the Paul Kelly 's team they 're not okay dokay just just look very similar so thanks for that John so the car parks all ready for use and the the tracks almost finished it 's all it needs us at the time of this report was the was the staggered lines if where you start so that the person on the outside of the track doesn 't have to run any different distance from the person on the inside lane so you 're all well aware of so of it the holes will domain sky skatepark update well that 's some that to work in progress but it 's jus to be completed in December but the exciting thing is the night 's dream car parts night 's dream skatepark update is not only coming on budget but two months early so just like to really congratulate the team on that and just let people know that if some they have problems with or sure they don 't say anything about that oh okay so anyway we 've been very very fortunate that we 've been able to actually achieve what we have and in night 's dream and it 's a wonderful thing and it 's actually opened now it is open now but it will be officially opened on Friday the 12th of October so because it 's been been done ahead of time we didn 't really want we didn 't really want to have it fenced off until then did we and the community didn 't so the barriers are down and people can use it so that 's um that 's a update unless there 's any questions on that that 's pretty straightforward I think and that we 're just wait until the contracts are lit for the next stage of harity key to Mehta folk so that we can set up with the contractor a way of communicating for the community to actually communicate with the contractor to run to answer any questions or resolve any outstanding issues on the way and forward with this difficult engineering work moving on the into the wicket racecourse race course alcohol Ben so that 's something that comes around every year and maybe one of these days it 'll become permanent the Templeton community submission writing workshop with council staff and the community you 've actually been working with the Templeton res it 's Association to help them with compiling written submissions on decision into the decision-making process including resource consent applications at a long-term plan and local projects so I think that 's a really good initiative from staff to actually get involved with the residents Association and help them to get the head around thinking about what might happen and when and district fault and Hoeven actually or you 've saying time 's up and I thought I was gonna have a little bit more yes thank you so that 's um that 's one year wonderful me that 's in the Rickett excuse me in the record area for children aged between 8 and 13 years to think positively about themselves they 're working with the university have came to Bri on that one so that 's um that 's a good news story the capsules graffiti program of course is ten years old so that 's an invitation to turn on reinventing and coming up on that and the community service the woods we did touch briefly on that at the last bit but here it is dad brother Jimmy is this the the information on the community service and youth awards that we held in the Rickett and racecourse tes and we were and we were entertained by the Iranian society with their excellent dancing on moving on to the hollow horn the event dance the next one yet next year and March next year as some of speak and other matters progress you know in the community playing and community board matters of interest I just like to briefly say that because it 's mentioned here about the area around the Eddington sale yards but it 's quite exciting that that the University of actually doing a study out they into fly-tipping in our ward and they 've asked their community board members for for area so it 'll be interesting in this they 're going to give the feedback of the spot at fly-tipping investigation to our board so then we 'll probably have a great feature and passing it on to the council as well as what they discover from that so in the others of course the the student volunteer army and that 's that 's a stag group and it 's really really pleased to see that that some that 's sort of gone viral cuz we started here in Christchurch as we know and at the time of the earthquakes but it 's it 's grown there too it 's not only students as other people involved in that as well and with the majorie Stoneman Douglas high school and the some of the survivors from that tragedy coming out here and and being involved with our student volunteer army and community and planting some trees and halls for Cory and recognition of that I 'm very very sad of beat so that 's and the other thing is of course the helpful hand and random facts is why why Pina which is why for water in Pune for spring is very very appropriate for our bare water and we 're very grateful to receive that at our last board meeting and we because we do have the headwaters of the of the Three Rivers starting from Springs and our Ward so when it couldn 't be more appropriate and it 's interesting to know that the Rickett and stream goes a lot of people don 't realize that the guys directly flows directly under the westfield more and then pops back out on the other side of Division Street yeah yeah yeah so anyway there we are I won 't ask is there any questions because that 's for you to the hollow home be this my understanding that this year when we organized committee members but you win date under where the home investment association they were not yet you know establish I suggest this time next year we should consider invite their cheer or their committee member as in part of the committee members know yes in a hobby area yep we can make that we can we can look at this it 's a support to realize that that committee is not lead by council it 's lead by the community so the community will decide who is on the committee in council staff if no involvement in it okay secondaries are because of coming for meeting on 24 that you like have me for a pool for some of the local walk you know a local roll pin for those that are the heavier recall you mentioned earlier yeah I just want to know there 's a party or party a because today I didn 't see this information that 's a yeah that 's part it 's not a part I it 's okay you should I think it 's effective as of already there are there I 'm not sure yeah because already yesterday I got a phone call you know from say me the CMAs street races this year contender heavy motor vehicle still pursue it 's allowed to JWA thank you yep it 's the wolf on there officially but my understanding currently little bit effective names or what I just saw which is already there brother some of the door has been for quite enough a few years actually it 's just being difficult to enforce with Aaron did you have a question yeah I just did around Mike on the property review process Commission come around all the boards and your boards opted to retain everything we opted to sell everything with the same paper are we dealing with it secretly yeah I can 't wait so could we I 'll put the emotion all those in favor say aye those opposed they no it 's Carrie and we 'll move on to the Denson Park paper did you want to make a comment about that or I was actually going 's no it 's alright okay yeah if you did you want to make a comment about it was a board resolution to receive the the hearings panels recommendation and with with with an addition and when that was some when that was put it was putting unanimously at the board so and I 'm just quite happy to and with the help of Sarah if need be to answer any questions I understand that there 's going to be another resolution added to this one which says that request staff to report back to the 13th of September 2018 council meeting on a process for progressing as quickly as possible the assessment of site options and the development of the proposed library service center and Southwest Leisure Centre and Hornby notwithstanding the earlier decision to approve Denton Park as the preferred location so that 's an amendment that is gonna come near is the process is that the process from here as made clear as quickly as possible because this has created an enormous delay in there do we need to revoke the earlier decision to you but actually to change reserved stages we could simply revoke the decision of the 21st 24th of August 2017 and request staff to report back on a new process to in terms of process Standing Orders says that any decision were in your recommendation to revoke an earlier require 75 rom must come from the chief executive with two days working days notice now we haven 't done that and we weren 't contemplating doing that right now we just felt that we should at least note the fact that there had been that early resolution when we come back to you there will probably be a recommendation that we revoke that can we request after report back or request the chief executive them to report back and it was at the six of September is that the appropriate date okay so yeah so if we request the chief executive to report report back on a proposal to revoke the decision of the 24th of August and to provide advice on our process so just the rest of the words and then get rid of the brackets yah but it 's got there are some questions so I 'm going to have to decide where the questions are directed to so it may well be staffed so it 's might be more appropriate rather than there was a council resolution all right so so has anyone got any questions of Mike and if not all will say thank you to you and then we 'll get I just want to know if a pale power of five should be including tegra3 the papacy kayo Carter undertake a loss to alert your Tecla investigation should be the first priority it 's on undo I know yeah how do we know it 's not undertaken just a initiate a subcontractor with the possible the consulting company it seems as soon as possible there 's nothing there 's nothing further that we can do from a governance perspective then ask for it to be done as soon as possible yeah yes because why I emphasize this one because a based on the possible location of a new facility to keep you active based on the last year even though this year you know the capital kind of policy talk so we need a defense counsel 18 I 'm just going to ask that we don 't go into the the decision-making area so if we just focus on what this is and it 's requesting that the geotech investigations happen as quickly as possible staff of going out to tinder because it 's not something that we 've got internal expertise in relation to it will be going out to get a contractor to do that work for us immediately so thank you alright so reef yeah just you said about the geo there were two things though one thing you said it was happening right now and then you said it was going out for tender yes the budget for they produce okay are we gonna make a decision on that when we get into the tender back in terms of how much it 's gonna cost to do the geotech normally that would be delegated to the that the project team you wouldn 't expect the council 's made that was only thinking where the remediation is decontamination this is just the geotechnical of a tissue that we need to actually go back and relook at all of those it says it that the development of the proposed library service Central and Letcher center yeah and my doesn 't say one site one doesn 't say one entity okay it was located to come back to us for a decision yes I made either which way everything comes back now for a decision thank you I 'll just question this is very eerie Yanni so your your image has now been restored so far away just it 's really a question of both the board and the staff but given you know that it 's really important every item to continuously improve how we make good decisions is it any preparing any consideration given to some sort of or review of this whole process to see what lessons we could learn from it as I understand it staff are getting together and working through the process that 's been followed and where it could be improved or any issues that might come out of it so there is a review underway I just whole process around us and the additional costs we know incurring I do think maybe if we could get a memo run wall so the listeners food prices on the way I think that would be really real thank you yep it will be done thank you all right good question investigation we go to the tender in the system I just want to know you know regarding high up are we we pub need to request for proposal to define clearly decrease the possible contractor follow our request so my question sir which area how big area how think we need to undertake this that you take an investigation and also that I was told about the community whether we consider to one of each penetrate in the great assistant to eat more kind of thoughtfully this I suggest should be considered as part of our request for proposal it 's a great question they we 're just in the process of going out for a proposal so it 's far too early to answer that at the moment so we will come back to you as soon as quickly as we can and we 're going out to the market for a proposal currently so yes you need to consider these Westar should be consider these factory yeah now that these are there any possible absolutely could because there is other stakeholders there we have got a BMX track there there is all other impacted party so yeah we 'd absolutely thank you it 's great thank you alright so do I have a mover in a second I do know I don 't I will have a counselor Jimmy chin would move and seconded by Sarah I will put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know it 's Carrie sorry what 's it or not that was it was it delay it was a delay yeah and in thank you Sarah for for cheering the hearings committee the feedback was extremely positive so we 're very very pleased so thank you for taking on that role right thank you very much pop you review the property review okay right okay so did you want to just briefly introduce this one or a pretty straightforward I said yeah well I was just asking you 're wastin do we owe because I know that Aaron 's got a question for you so we could go straight to the question if you like yeah okay for Aaron faraway times now yes so just there 's a lot of properties there you guys and some of them I can understand why you need to keep them one that stood out for me was Maine South Road the old service center because it 's quite an eyesore for the public these days and there to be a lot better developed and to thinking it 's worth several million dollars why did that one not make the list of any well because the way it was derived originally its own deemed to be it would have to go through the kremlin disposal process it 's also part of it so it was a previous quarry bacon up stage and some of the buildings of society but we are we have seen the signal that we do want the demolition of debt service into building and done ASAP so 's some other issue need to be resolved before the final and I don 't know whether we 'd want to talk about them just yet like for example look the open Street yard you know you but there 's also been armed plans to put a road link these through here as well so be some unresolved transport planning issues associated with it and just to clarify to the crown I think it 's quite a long list with few dividends the dividend to come as things evolved so much difficult for the community in [Music] deal the properties on eschaton Road are they occupied at the moment just two of them champagne tennis because there 's one two three four five six seven eight reasoning Hawaii lifestyle blocks around there one of them is not owned by the council 's there right that 's got people in there that are very comfortable with their abode and their location and very and haven 't_''_8780.47 got any issue tennis you have to do what 's the noise from yeah so something that leads on to the next question I had land should not be used for the land is not to be used for permanent residential use yeah I mean is that is that still the case because I mean there 's four million dollars worth of land that we 're sitting on what land of the property that we 're sitting on there just in market again I mean it just seems like these these properties on there that aren 't been used at the council owned actually I will not utilizing them in some way or I yeah they just seem like a Peter or he 'd would love to live their career what 's to I think it is still the existing council Wizards I mean so the ones where there are habitable houses and we 're tentative they 're on a temporary basis not permanent the value is somewhat affected if we 're going to if the council is going to control news so they might be valuable as lifestyle blocks if you can somehow so that therefore significantly properties being additional well so what is the underlying land use at the moment what about the under the old district name which was one of the most newly seats of the rules learning you could have in fact it couldn 't handle that noise restriction you couldn 't have you start out to change to it could your next-door neighbor could complain a bit on the rule five I just like yes I mean when was the decision of the last when was the decision made for or their previous resolution made the previous resolution was made when it was before the before the district plan review in fact it was before the earthquakes so how long have we own these properties it 'd probably be probably close to ten years oh it 's like she just I actually think we should actually look at that resolution and look at these properties in a little bit more detail than just say keep them because there 's there 's quite a lot of capital wound up there annoyed there are our people are in currently I mean I 'm an electric can 't use it at all my live index to a petrolhead place that would sound I don 't know how we can if he was in the airport idea but I think there 's these ones it there you know these properties that Heskett sroe probably need a little bit more closer look than just letting them like because I say you could keep those properties potentially for some linked link to affect motorsport we 've got a regional motorsport a true opponent I was one of the ones on a different side to my I think previous counsel the one before that the properties was a long-term strategy to hold them for some activity that 's linked to thick motorsport okay so does the board support rather than just retaining the following properties was fees for future strategic purpose actually maybe for these specific properties actually start a process of actually looking more in detail over those the purpose of having them in their category is that we do look at them in the future make the exact decisions you 're talking about yeah but I mean there 's this it just I mean that is just sitting on the land I actually think proactive and actually within maybe resolution within this so we should be a bit more proactive on these specific properties because there is it just seems of all of them that actually this there 's a bit more use it can be I 've just been told that only two of them have been used there 's five properties there I think what you might be suggesting dinners because that 's the intent is to look at these as you 're saying you want and prioritized we do these ones sooner rather than later yeah I think so I think I mean they just seems logical that they 're sitting there and not being utilized we the reason that resolution three offers us can you just lift that up a wee bit rather than just limit that to an alternative public view so no well I 'm gonna there no tilt into public use gets around us but an alternative strategic or public use you know like because it may well not necessarily be in our interest to be the owner so no I was going to ask the same I know that there was a debate at the time as to whether building halls was appropriate way of memorializing as an you know the issue arises when a building comes to the end of its life and this one 's been damaged and closed by the earthquake so it 's not serving the purpose that it was built for and it 's not serving any purpose and I mean has it actually better off an hour ownership doing that or is it better off in the communities ownership where they could you know sort of develop it and I understood that there was some interest in the alleged community but next week I 'll be meeting with the receptor community group that 's driving and the proposal for the August but I mean that may invoke them putting up a proposal where they become the owners but but why would we make a decision now to hold us and our ownership the exactly because we we don 't want to prove discussions with with with the community mr. Watson and I have been talking that any way he can we just um clarify something in terms of the prices but the first precipitous decision we had last month is do we want it to keep property surplus and sell them now that is a bit rid of the process where does at the underlying designation we 're absolutely obliged I thinking in then you 've got the seeking group of properties which is let 's hold these for strategic purpose to be worked on over the future and then these those two properties there in the third group which is we think these would be suitable for community uses or community uses and other public uses let 's work and come up with a proposal if I 'm poking out properly around maybe the altars and the Heskett roads properties I think the category therein is good what I 'm hearing is you want to prioritize those and have them looked at sooner rather than later you know sorry I don 't think it needs being meet the resolutions are mended but what what it is is a message to staff community board that we cranked on the first we can get out if we can get that you know assertion that I suppose then we 'll have to follow it up and uh sigh I hope the community will follow that up yeah but I mean this is asking us to delegate authority to the community board to make the decision for retention for alternative views whereas I mean the community board might say no we better own hurt not gonna we 're not going to put a proposal back to council you true you know but you could yeah you know and I mean the question is is I mean oh I 've got I 've got no philosophical objection to the community board making making a decision but but I I kind of don 't want them to feel constrained around the delegated authority and that we would be probably prepared to consider you know selling it as we have done with other facilities I mean we 've either provided funding or we 've provided a facility to a community group who 've taken it over and so these that resolution for relates only to the three so it 's only related to the third group of properties which is to look for alternate uses that 's varied to paragraph two sees support retention of the following property subject to the conditions in resolution 3 and then resolution 3 sees retention of the properties set out and resolutions 1 and 2 above so it doesn 't make sense to mount just if if it really is one unto above this Y which that should just be one just be title well I don 't agree with that because these are whole lot more properties that should be in there know that resolution 3 should actually only say retention of the property set out so the grossest outline theorem three and four relates to the two properties and resolution there is no intention to give delegations or make decisions on the others apart from hold them for the purpose of being looking at more review in the future and those decisions will come back through the Community Council this is what I got confused because three C 's retention of the properties set out in resolutions one we want you to go through a process of this for some of the properties and one or shall we I mean correct but that the decisions and one what are we going to do with those properly strategically they 're not to go out and look for alternate public uses so the community board have seen in terms of the two properties and two we think they 're suitable for alternate public uses we want you to go out and look at those and they 've got to meet those criteria and bring back some decisions on future public uses the the properties in the first category and not hey we want to look for alternate public uses they require so much higher strategic decisions do we want to hold them do we want to sell them those sort of things so that would be a separate line of work that 's a separate line of work and end at a highest pratik level whereas the ones in I definitely go out and find another public use we want to keep those in Council ownership and we want to saying properties are money if then keep them and council ownership for a future strategic purpose yeah yes yeah so the workers to identify that strategic purpose or not there 's there 's need to be identified so what these sides would not think these but he shall be a soul will be used for another public purpose until we really have a good feeling of what we want to do with them so I could been working with a community where they actually go let 's sell them we 've got some other ideas we want to use for them yeah it 's not a final decision tonight but I think those properties retention where delegation to the community board I think if you look at in terms there 's a list of properties and one is we don 't want them to let 's Elton the other one is we want to use them for public uses and the other one is we 're not retaining it I think there is a way for you don 't need to change the delegation the resolution is recommended there if hurdle it needs to be addressed and for sites such as if your concern is a used example that board like the side they want to retain the your host school but counsel might choose to have a different approach in fact it comes into play because there is no budget set aside apart for demolition so the pause won 't help that delegation because there is no funding established you 'll have to come back and Council for the final decision after the funding and it was the same pretty sure the Heskett swerd we don 't contain I have to scrimp and save to find any money be we have in there because there 's no allocation and long-term plan for the maintenance of this Haskett Road property that becomes the key restriction and leave the recommendation as is and the board 's recommendations we passed the County Council consideration I 'm just I mean I 'm not wondering you know you 've been very helpful thank you for that I 'm I 'm just I 'm thinking that there was a pretty strong submission as I recall front of me in relation to the author 's Memorial Hall that I 'm hearing from the community board chair that there are an active conversation with the community rather than including us on a resolution that states that we want to approve the retention of it for a future strategic purpose when we have money on budget just to demolish it I would I 'd much rather just say provide further advice on you also take it out of there provide further advice on your Tunis Memorial Hall five to four pound road once the discussions have been had with the local community that says if you go the three that we 're teaching of the public properties and as long as for public use it can be rationalized set us satisfy satisfies a clearly identified need and the supported by us and robust does in this case and that is that is what 's happening now is that community you 're trying to put together a sound robust business case if they can 't then it will come back and we may we may and start considering other what I 've been told is that the expression yeah cleric therel resolution one and is not what the report was mean saying it was only mean three is only meant to apply to well we were quite happy with it at a community board to accept the staff recommendation without change because we 'd had workshops we had workshop on it we 've been visited all the sites we had this before this report was written when it did come to us we were comfortable and as a majority is to adopt the staff recommendation without change well here but I 'm gonna move an amendment then because I 'm I just think that classifying it as approving the retention of it for a future strategic purpose today is not necessary when we 're having conversations with the community and I think it would show good faith to the community that we highlighted the authoress Memorial Hall that we see that we wanted further advice once the once the local community had had an opportunity to provide some important I mean it just I just think it would send think this one yeah thanks yeah well probably I had perceived through through the discussions appealed is with us thing to come back to the business plan through the board I mean anybody council remembering that the board is hint made a recommendation get demolished it came to council and yeah so they 've had seven months of of research and having a look at it the only question I have put to them they who put it on hold the council does December December last year company for presented is the issue particular so this is why why do we want to include it on a resolution approving the retention of it when we haven 't had that at the time the council resolved at that time to do it in black on this process which was doing what this is with this would anyone diamond does if I was to just cross it out okay sure okay your zappiti move yes and seconded by Vicki right any discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried thank you tea and coffee outside do people want a griever grab a coffee it will take take ten minutes you well in the meeting the same way right so the next item as the chief executives report I 'm just gonna take it as read I was going to talk about the awards but we 've already done that so all right Yani I know that you 're the heir yeah okay yeah I just I had some questions on those like that far away just I just wondered will still not have any date for the review of the Moshe issue the drinking water fizzes any update on a lightly fed back for that report by Robertson that 's Christian I don 't see that in my report there you asking got something outside of my report you a date at the moment right okay this in question was in relation to the properties in my next reference to a letting donut on page 120 under the intervention pulse it books about the problem ooh quiet and one of the issues one of the questions and the polymers that says understand if there 's any crisis strategically to think about potential transit users properties are demolished this was raised as part of discussions over the Cape Fear River briefing took a break from that we had his community boards in Danish and what sort of property disposal prices so I just want to understand if there is any report coming back to us around future use options is the most just thinking what 's happened in the woods done for example or something shrine of wood and traditionally produces we always look at those things but some of the properties will be related to work around land drainage and we required for that so it really depends on the specific use or not over that period of time so there 's not planned to be any report coming back on individual properties I think that 's a real gap and I think we should think about some sort of crisis at least particularly you know not just not long if he 's getting a different number of properties on the property disposal less that have come through the community or properties are acquired we 've got potential cycleways going through the designs and lens that bends for the river and yet you don 't seem to have any any connection to the properties that have been acquired and linda morris yes so as i say will consider all those things with individual properties but is a mini limit abolished as part of a bigger program such as the lane drainage program sorry I just I understand why we require there anything else because this works that we 're doing on those properties in terms of interchange well they might be it depends on the individual properties okay I just wonder if we get a memory with the processes for consideration before they 're demolished and if the board what community have potential uses the thing that was around whether there 's any sort of excitement going on of the properties issues that came up with return demolitions that they 'd like the same velocity inhabited much with though was to go and go lane for rather than being used with the values we 've always considered those things as well Ellis it starts on page 118 the Christmas service related to three wonders and websites related to compliance at the top rate I 'm just really concerned about the necessary lender trades for their increased by 22% over the last year and it was potholes written that in sweeping can you just give us an understanding of what the organization is doing in response that huge increase and when we sort of expect to see here stabilized in terms of the increase not not going up as much or hopefully reducing significantly so as you 're we 're and we 've been doing some work around our maintenance contracts insuring that the responses and proactive in terms of the things around potholes so again through the CSR process outlook to repair those as soon as possible and had some good feedback on some of those I think some of those is also about just increase awareness and increased ability for people to put on CSR 's so we 're likely to continue to see more of those over a period of time before they level off sorry yeah you go developed that I think it 's a a is the smart met but you can actually make an actually longer than see all the CSR type requests I just think that 's a fantastic resource and it 's valuable for us as elected members to see it as clusters of requests coming in and and so I think it 's only since that solve at the moment but I just want to pass them by an appreciation for the staff that have developed that I get to really support oh you think and I agree that it helped us helpful for us in to really focus on perhaps our contracts in particular areas or to identify we need to put some extra effort any other questions from the Qi particular from glean like it 's a question thank you for the information on the comprehensive stormwater Network discharge consent Kanan Carlene which the EU tight trust is taking an interest in a perspective but my question is about the midges just what are those information that ensuring the new plan Mitch control measures are ready for the start of next sorry to get the detail of it no yes I understand rather than new it 's about and you know a new year in terms of addressing that and it was reasonably successful at the end of last season so we were looking to do that earlier and more comprehensively good well I 'd like to move it Oh Jimmy regarding to the kt11 5 engagement in consultation here patita emphasized the council the 14 project consultation states were some of the Finnish but my view is because we have launched multi culture strategy for more than one year but my view is quite a few other projects still not yet engaged with lost mode as multi-protocol or service information second further this time I 'm quite happy the kind of the councillor heritage the strategy they have a focus on engaged with those culture group leaders where Tanaka so this made other even I 'm quite happy whether this one can be the kind of role model no the other party might consider just one kind integrate all those that commit leaders come to feed a very good suggestion things a bit oh great thank you don 't think so you know I just want to make the point in Colleen 's refer to the opening of the woods mill and just how significant that is given the time that has taken I think it 's probably at least 15 years that 's been going for certainly well pre-earthquake there were attempts to restore it and I I take them hits off the developers where to go and there were quite a few failures but as I think it 's a good example with the Hagen and what was big money it was 900,000 it has really worked out I understand that all of the apartments and that mr. King has built have all been sold and it was good to be at their opening let 's bring down to have a look at it over the weekend all right well I 'll move that we receive the report is there a seconder for that felt I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's carried and now we 'll move thought that I would highlight the Marjory Stoneman Douglas students buzz up to Christchurch as well I know that one of the community boards did too but it was an exceptionally powerful occasion I thought it was a great opportunity to have young students who 've been through you know a disaster meeting up with a group of students who who who didn 't so much live through the disaster and the role that they 're in today but but showed the longevity of a movement that had purpose and it 's the student volunteer army so they both organizations mutual it was faster but you know I just thought it was incredibly powerful and I went to their leadership summit where they had a number of presentations and then they cooked all of the adults out of the room and the two groups have worked hard on developing that the the model that enables a movement to keep going beyond the you know that were the immediate aftermath of disaster so I 've invited the student volunteer army to come and present to the symposium that the government 's pleased with that approach and I think that 's going to be a very powerful legacy that they will leave not only our city and not the city of Charak employer but also you know the world in terms of young people and their capacity to step up after disaster strikes so it was a pretty pretty powerful and moving occasion as as as I both identified in the report so I 'm happy to answer any questions Jonnie have you got any questions for me I just I just only had one big comment really and it was just to say you know I was really disappointed I couldn 't be there for rooster mantova students for that is in Lemon Grove High School in the USA booked through metal detectors in school every day with found placement a tassel 24 simmer and also I 've got a personal connection to Florida that 's where my grandparents were from so I just really wanted to say thank you for hosting them I wanted to acknowledge near to go work for her role and bringing that together and while being and in yourself went out of your way to make them feel welcome and I just really appreciate appreciate that so that was only points to making the caste report yeah no thank you for that Yanni it was it was that and it was all of that it was it was incredibly amazing and Nancy Gilbert who 's our honorary consul and Florida she 's she 's had that role for I don 't know about nine months and I think she 's achieved more then I then I think that any honorary consul in the world has achieved in terms of making a very real and meaningful connection between Florida and and Christchurch New Zealand it 's just yeah it 's been outstanding so um Vicki very brief question their symposium you mentioned and I seem to remember reading somewhere the number of people that could go to it wasn 't very high well there are a number of workshops that are being worked on as well it 's just the venue yeah going to be able to be watched yes always directly as I understand it will the end of November but there 'll be a lot more details that there 's still invitations going out to speakers and sorting out the final process and we 've got a couple of workshops that we 're working on at the moment as well alright would someone like to move Thank You Erin thank you I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye there 's a pose they know right it 's carried the people would laugh and Yony because it 's like you 're saying no timings the timings everything so that 's alright that 's a delayed yes thank you the next item on the agenda agenda is external membership on Council hearings panels which we asked for a report back on so we 're going back to the other here we go so this is a delegation to myself acting on advice in terms of any external membership to Council hearings panels other than those under the RMA on a case-by-case merit basis where matters of significance to manaphy nowhere have been identified are being considered this came up as a result of ago you 're happy to move move by term second about Aaron I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much the outline yeah no this sorry all sorry to interrupt mr. regards to that voting I 'm just saying if I don 't want something voted against I 'll just express it but otherwise I 'll just remain silent and just take it home that won 't be in favor unless they express otherwise cause right is that okay I was just gonna say regards to voting I 'll just only somebody who did something I just say anything okay just thank you okay so the the next paper is the outline under the greater crash eh regeneration each proposed part revocation so I 'm just I 'm just trying to find which paper it 's on it 's on the first one it 's not yeah yeah okay I 've got it unto me who have we got what 's this one gonna be Ivan Thompson Ivan Ivan perfect timing come and grab a seat I know what it means what it means is that regenerate Christchurch developing their chakra Aven River corridor regeneration plan rather than well yeah the outline proposes partial revocation it says evocation and here revocation of existing provisions of the loop and the crash essential recovery plan that could have fit the achievement of outcomes and the regeneration plan oh sorry this is this outline proposes partial replication of existing provisions of the loop in the central city recovery plan that could affect achievement of outcomes and the attacker open river corridor regeneration plan so it 's that tiny little bit of the even proton baroque Aven river corridor that sits within the forever news so it 's all it 's talking about as just that little portion of land that that sits within the sea CRP boundaries which is within the forever news okay so it 's just that tiny but it 's the urban loop do we need a map you know what I mean they 're even loop yeah turn so just because for me I 've been bit you know going on about how important the of the city 's life to add a city park to our armory if you like of for events at Citrus Headley Parker 's up to the point of almost being overused we have an opportunity how will their to fit this or our process in our site and that okay the current situation is that the central crisis recovery plan has Appendix 1 which is the regulatory framework for the central city and that regulatory framework is now in our district plan but it is all that area zoned residential so the actual recovery plan itself used the old zoning so is living for or for a or something in our new plan that is central city residential now in order for the regeneration for the of Tokoro Haven regeneration or the corridor plan to keep momentum in the city in that part of the Central City we need to change the plan and we can 't change the plan and totally we broke that part of the Christchurch central recovery plan in the loop and you are not quite sure about the lit there 's a in the clarification on what part of the loop needs to be revoked I actually I 'm personally I don 't think the live probably needs to be touched for this particular process that probably we can address that issue later on as because it 's basically done but you come a bit but near the recovery of the central city we will the crisis injury recovery plan needs to amend in order to facilitate that corridor through into the Aven loop yeah I 'm so and clean thanks Ivan and look we 're we 're regeneration Christchurch regenerate cruisers have been doing their consultation and I 'm just wondering what other opportunities that might still be for example we had a presentation in our committee yesterday Kate Jews around on world peace of discernment she remind us that LC Locke and the previously being apart as you 'll recall and there 's no longer known no longer the year so it 's in Kate 's ado stirred that perhaps around the part of that Haven Luke there might be a pic scope for a part with a peace walk so just area is this still still scope within regeneration Croatians plans for us to be able to include some of these ideas that have come to this council table I believe so this is the first stage the an outline simply sits out the process it doesn 't set out the outcomes now some of you may remember we did the Cranford regeneration plan that is that was preceded by an outline and what the outline did was said right you 've got to this is the process by which you will do the regenerate your planets timeframes engagement that kind of thing so this is the same thing it doesn 't actually deal with outcome so what the outline says this is a process this is the issue right now we the next stage is to do the replication and then there was more feedback sorter Maxo partners and that 's the appropriate time you could give that feedback clean take you in thank you are my questions in relation to an example the page 136 we 're at sears for example section 60 of their project requires RMA decision-makers plan or a recovery plan I 'm just curious over what whether there are any potential downsides to that or any detail that we need to be no that 's a very reason for doing this because if we generate Christ years produced a plan which say hit open space which is probably likely its inconsistent with the central crisis recovery plan so you can 't_''_12285.13 do that and so well they can 't amend well they can I 'm here but you can 't do a honey this what 's been revoked or amended this part of it so that what they do is consistent with theory with that recovery plan that the way I read this was that this was more of a belt belts and braces approach because they actually have the power under the regeneration to amend the Central City recovery plan and the plan itself but I think that they don 't want to do that because in a way it detracts from what they 're trying to do in terms of the the whole of the the vision for the corridor the assignment and plan I mean I I favor this approach I probably wanted to see whether it could go but further and sort of few other things out but I 've been persuaded that it 's probably better to deal with this as a standalone item and and resolve it and it 's it 'll be a relatively quick process I don 't think anyone will will take a particular objection to to freeing the SAP for the regeneration processes under the age it 's it 's just cortana it 's caught in a that there 's little vortex of previous remaining arrangements yeah suit to act for the wider corridor once no no once once I need just phone no no just the Central City recovery plan stops at the four avenues so it doesn 't go into the residential red zone at any other way shape or form down I just wanted to be clear so by doing this I actually I 'll start again the reason that we need to do this is because there 's a central city living and that would go against what region are trying but it would make it easier procedurally and clearer for the public I think as to what what needs to be done to regress the you know taro Haven corridor regeneration plan and to the seer into the Central City windows part of the central city yeah it 's just clearing the regular tree so you didn 't actually make it look reason seen about the routine of central city residential in this area for actually the points that who mentioned oh I get it that 's good raised yeah yeah yeah um Yanni did you have any questions no I 'm good thank you so moved by Dion Sikandar but um I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much thanks Ivan draft submission on the Christchurch casino license renewal application hmm yes you have it interest in the casino don 't say things like there even as a joke it 's not funny okay right sorry this is on the other sheet right okay so this hasn 't been to a committee or anything like like to introduce it then I 'm sure the staff can add to their spell I guess the casino being well known we it also has a a very big role really in terms of hospitality in Christchurch it 's quite central so but what when we had the workshop we decided we 'd really like him that was with compliance from staff to that we 'd like to see some additional conditions with the license that they have it 's not to say they 're not doing a good job and the things and in an orderly way but there are some some things that we thought could be improved one was that they be clear of messaging around the issue of problem gambling for people so that those negative effects of gambling can be avoided and also beer and we need two beer in mind and it was in the report that the in Christchurch we 've got a high proportion of our population who who need to see problem gambling services then throughout the rest of the country so what the other part with the submission to bigger contribution to the charitable trust which assists problem gambling and and the report shows that in fact when the casino started there was quite a significant amount of money I think was about two hundred thousand a year that has come back quite a lot and we understand that throughout New Zealand casinos do contribute more and we 're going to the recommendation was that we asked for either two point five percent of their profits or two hundred twenty-five thousand a year right whichever was that the greater so yeah and in the other part too was that that we as a council could have them closer links with the Trust 's and be more involved so that in fact there might be a counselor okay who who will be part of a forum that they already have so that in fact we can you know have these discussions around these issues and their council netway would be like what they are christchurch communities for the casino yes wonder sorry I wasn 't_''_12657.7 at the same a nice day and I just wonder if the 2.5% is actually their figures the tech their profit was an excess of 16 million the vortex 4217 the net profit for their kids casino is not provided within the skyline group but the group recorded a profit of 68 million for the 217 yeah I think we 're being quite conservative with our 225 and when Christchurch casino came into the city or was the first casino in the country so it wasn 't subject to these same walls I like the idea that that they have to give some money back to the community I don 't think it all needs to go on problem gambling I think that but but they should definitely provide money back to a community that needs it and I just think 225,000 is oh it 's low I mean at the moment they 're giving they started off at one hundred and ninety one thousand per year for the first five years and then they drop just do one hundred and forty-one thousand so this is probably the only chance we get for what another 25 years 15 years 15 ok still quite a long I just think 225 is very conservative are going to agree is what one counts are to Vicky and I guess now is a time to perhaps increase that percentage at least yeah keeps us in line with walkand 500k that 's what they will see queenstown wolf making profits the same a certain Auckland sorry the profits the same and all condors that no but proportionally Pearson Christ you know no it 's not about this isn 't about the problem problem gambling that 's this is actually about giving back giving back to the community and I think you 've got a better chance if you if you make it proportionate to you know the other the other institutions which is what I thought that you had done but um we 'd certainly provided a comparison of what the other casinos are required to put into the Charitable Trusts is it a percentage and will they very a lot of them have a percentage in a in a dollar figure the similar to what 's being proposed here with the greater required to go to the trust but throughout the country and we haven 't been able to find a clear rationale for why those differences exist so the only conclusion we could come to is that it 's somewhat arbitrary and Anders decided as part of I guess a negotiation with the community to establish a casino in the first place as councilor back seed as Christchurch was the first casino in the country and that negotiation of with the community if you like didn 't happen right did you I 'm just I 'm just reading it now back over again because did you make the point that that this that we were the first cab off the rank of as it were and that before subsequent licenses have enabled you know that conversation to occur no that 's not specifically made but the that 's a good point though yeah it 's quite a strong point and and I actually also like the the language that Vicki just used which is social license you know because there is you know I mean gambling is going to occur and society whether it 's legal or not it but this is this is this is legalized gambling so and one of the quid pro quos as the returned to both the problem that it creates and also to the community the community parts the social license in my views so I just think that if we just make that a little bit stronger as they 're not hearing submissions are they or are they yes they are and in the recommendation the second recommendation is that the council delegate look uh nothing sort of but I mean I you know I don 't want to give myself each too weird but what about saying delegated authority to the MIR in the chair of the social community I 'm very happy that you speak to it yeah because I mean I just think that if you want something then you 've got to present a really powerful case and and the language is important and the history is important as well so which means that we don 't really need if we 're going to be heard in person then we don 't need to adjust it we does this have to be M by its next week 's okay well look why don 't you just delegate the final version to me and Phil yep yep coming up going to things quickly with the young the time framing the dollar amount immense it could be that this is just a suggestion when you do speak that it could be a dollar amount that increases over time and it could be as part of the license but the other thing is with the inconsistency around the country of the different amounts of the lake of clarity over why there does do we want to write to the government and ask for a national sort of directive on that I I think that would be fine but it won 't solve this no no no so Julia only because they don 't give didn 't either licenses came up yeah it 's not good if there 's an additional I survived it 's not high on the list no I wasn 't inside yeah given that all the casinos will need to go through this process at some point who will oversee all of those are in your process here but getting some sort of consistent approach every Chanel and things like that would be really good yes and asking for that to happen so I 'm happy with what you 've suggested Lian but I wonder if we couldn 't just alter that dollar forget but let the minimum for Gabi yeah no no no prob but but those figures should be 2.5 and 500 yeah two point five and five hundred or five hundred thousand whichever is the greater yeah which is what the documents yeah questions is that post tax now presuming they pay income tax they they pay income tax is a consolidated group the casino is part of the skyline corporation so all of them pay income tax in the requirements in the conditions are net profit so after Tech 's business and they do pay taxes anybody laughter you use a gambling leave in the gambling maybe that 's it so that the top of each machine as well so yeah yeah I understand it and I understand the whole the double zeros is the this is the figure for Auckland alright so that five hundred seems yeah yeah over the season concrete for fifteen years as well I think it 's fine because you 're covered by the two point five percent so yeah alright that Wharf is done why would someone like to move this Phil would you like to move it seeking to Vicky I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that is carried [Applause] now have we got right there is no public excluded items for us to consider today so I would like to wait wait wait I was going to declare the meeting closed but just just just you know just I want to do it on the right note right I declare the meeting closed Saturday night you _"

you 're the heir Danny okay yeah I just I had some questions on this I like that far away just I just wondered we still not have any date for the review of the motor issue the drinking water fizzes any update on a lightly that back for that report by Bruce Robertson that 's the hostess question I don 't see that in my report so you asked him got something outside my report I give you a date at the moment okay this in question was in relation to the properties in no defense to letting ground on page 120 under the following intervention post-it books about the public move quiet and one of the issues well one of the questions and the polymers that says that will have been demolished I was just trying to understand if there 's any process strategically to think about potential principal discussions over the heath care of our briefing took a break from that we had his community Lords in Danish and what sort of a disposal process so I just want to understand if there is any report coming back to us around future use options for properties demolished just thinking what 's happened in the woods done for example with something that would and traditional uses we always look at those things but some of the properties will be related to our work around land drainage and we required for that so it really depends on the specific use or not over that period of time so there 's not plan to be any report coming back on individual properties I think that 's a real gap and I think we should think about some sort of crisis at least particularly you know just no longer if you 've got an area in the first number of properties on the property disposal less that have come through the community or the quite close to where possibly some of the properties are acquired we 've got potential cycleways going through yet you don 't seem to have any any connection to the properties that have been acquired and being demolished yes so as I say we 'll consider all those things with individual properties but as many of them had abolished as part of a bigger program such as the lane drainage program sorry I just I understand why we require them in saying that it was because there 's work that we 're doing on those properties in terms of land range well there might be it depends on the individual properties okay I just wonder if we get a memo with the processes for consideration before they 're demolished in it if the broad or what community have potential uses the that was around whether there 's any sort of real excitement going on of the properties issues that came up with return demolitions that they 'd like the same velocity and haven 't much with the was to go and go layin for rather than being used with a vet we 've always considered those things as well and a fun question my head was just around dozen bastards we needed to compliance to the top three I 'm just really concerned about the necessary lender trades for their increased by twenty two percent over last year and it was potholes Rotunda in sloping can you just give us an understanding of what the organization is doing in response that huge increase and when we sort of expect to see here stabilized in terms of the increase not not going up as much or hopefully reducing significantly so you sure we 're and we 've been doing some work around our maintenance contracts ensuring that the responses and in proactive in terms of the things around potholes again through the CSR process outlook to repair those as soon as possible and had some good feedback on some of those I think some of those is also about just increase awareness and increased ability for people to put on Caesars so we 're likely to continue to see more of those over a period of time before they level off you got hit I was just gonna commit the stuff that have developed that I think it 's we can actually log in and see all the CSR type requests I just think that 's a fantastic resource and it 's valuable for us as elected members to see leaders clusters of requests coming in and and so I think it 's only since that solve at the moment but I just want to pass them by an appreciation for the staff that have developed that I get to a really useful tool and I agree that it helped us helpful for us in to really focus on perhaps our contracts in particular areas or to identify we we need to put some extra effort any other questions of the QI particular from glean like it 's a question thank you for the information on the comprehensive stormwater Network discharge consent Kanan Carlene which the EU tight trust is taking an interest in a prospective but my question is about the midges just what are those information that ensuring the new plan Mitch control measures are ready for the start of next month what are the new measures of the site from I 'm sorry to get the than new it 's about and you know a new year and Tim 's of addressing that and it was reasonably successful at the end of last season so we were looking to do that who they are and more comprehensively good well I 'd like to move it Oh Jimmy regarding to the kt11 5 engagement and consultation here particular emphasized the council the 14 project for the consultation states were assembled to finish but my view is because we have launched the multicultural strategy for more than one year but my view is quite a few other projects still not yet engaged with lost mode as multi-protocol or so is information second father this time I 'm quite happy the kind of the council the heritage the strategy they have a focus on engaged with lost culture group leaders where Tanaka Saudis made other evening I 'm quite happy whether this one can be the kind of role model the other party might consider just one kind integrate all those that come in leaders come to feed a very good suggestion and the more we can integrate our thanks Lee you know I just want to make the point in Colleen 's refer to the opening of the woods mill and just how significant that is given the time that has taken I think it 's probably at least 15 years that 's been going for certainly well pre-earthquake there were attempts to restore it and I like taking hits off the developers where to go and with quite a few failures but as I think it 's a good example with the Haggard and what was big money was 900,000 it has really worked out I understand that all of the apartments and that mr. King has built have all been sold and it was good to be at their opening with a nice went down to have a look at it over the weekend it 's amazing all right well I 'll move that we receive the report is there a seconder for that felt I thought that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's carried _"

well because it was the way it was derived originally it 's some deemed to be would have to go through the Kremlin disposal process it 's also part of it stage and some of the buildings of society that we are we have seen the signal that we do what the demolition of debt service into building and done ASAP so that signals gone through but there 's also well there 's some other issues that need to be resolved before the final and I don 't know whether we 'd want to talk about them just you like for example look the open Street yard you know yeah but there 's also been armed plans to put a road these review as well so be some unresolved transport planning issues associated with it and just to clarify what Mike said about it his crown drive so council wouldn 't actually give me money from so we 'd have to attune it to the crown so I think it 's quite a sensible decision that would sit on a strategically until we I was all the transport water shoes it 's got some infrastructure on it and some of those issues before making decisions about quite a long list with a few dividends the diffidence become as things evolved so is on eschaton road are they occupied at the moment just two of them champagne tears because there 's one two three four five six seven eight reasoning white lifestyle blocks around there one of them is not owned by the council 's their rights a housing that 's got people in there that that are very comfortable with their abode and their location and very haven 't_''_210.04 got any issue tennis you have to do what 's the noise from yeah so something that leads on to the next question I had I mean that says in the report here that the land should not be used for the land is not to be used for permanent residential use yeah I mean is that is that still the case because I mean there 's four million dollars worth of land that we 're sitting on what land of the property that were sitting on there just stayed on in market again I mean it just seems like these these properties on there that aren 't been used at the council line actually I we 're not utilizing them in Peter or he 'd would love to live there what 's to I think it is still the existing council we do not put him in a prison so mean so the ones where there are habitable houses and where tenant that they 're on a temporary basis not permanent the value is somewhat affected if we 're going to if the council is going to control news so they might be valuable as lifestyle blocks if you can somehow so that therefore significantly well so what is the underlying land use at the moment what about the new district claim does anybody know the rule of five under the old district name which was one of the most newly seats of the rules learning you could have in fact it couldn 't handle that noise restriction you couldn 't have them start out to change to it cuz your next-door neighbor could complain a bit on the in size rule five I just like yes I mean when was the decision of the last when was the decision made for or their previous resolution made the previous resolution was review in fact it was before the earthquakes so how long have we own these properties it 'd probably be probably close to ten years like she does I actually think we should actually look at that resolution and look at these properties in a little bit more detail than just say keep them because there 's there 's quite a lot of capital wound up there annoyed there are our people are in currently I mean I 'm an electric can 't use it at all my live index to a petrolhead place that would sound right but um I just I do think I mean I don 't know how we can if he was in the airport idea but I think there 's these ones it they you know these properties that Heskett sroe probably need a little bit more closer look than just letting them like because I say you could keep those properties potentially for some linked link to affect motorsport we 've got a regional motorsport a true opponent I was one of the ones on a different side to my I think previous 's a long-term strategy to hold them for some activity that 's linked to Vic motorsport ok so does the board support rather than just retaining the following properties was a feast for future strategic purpose actually maybe for these specific properties actually start a process of actually looking more in detail over those because the purpose of having them in their category is that we do look at them in the future make the exact decisions you 're talking about yeah but I mean there 's this it just I mean that is just sitting on the land I actually think I 'd rather sort of to be a bit more proactive and actually within maybe resolution within this so we should be a bit more proactive on these specific properties because there is it just seems of all of them that actually this there 's a bit more use it can be I 've just been told that only two of them have been used there 's five properties there I think what you might be suggesting dinners because that 's the intent is to look at these these ones sooner rather than later yeah I think so I think I mean there just seems logical that they 're sitting there and not being utilized we the reason that resolution three offers us can you just lift that up a wee bit rather than just limit that to an alternative publicly so not well I 'm going up there no tilt into public use gets around us but an alternative strategic or public use you know like it because it may well not necessarily be in our interest to be the owner so no I was going to ask the same question about the your host Memorial Hall you know and I know that there was a debate at the time as to whether building halls was appropriate way of memorializing as an you know the issue arises when a building comes to the end of its life and this one 's been damaged and closed by the earthquake so it 's not serving the purpose that it was built for and it 's not serving any purpose and I mean as it actually better off and our communities ownership where they could you know sort of develop it and I understood that there was some interest in the alleged community but next week I 'll be meeting with the receptor community group that 's driving the proposal for deal just but I mean that may bother them putting up a proposal where they become the owners but but why would we make a decision now to hold it and now ownership exactly because we we don 't want to prove discussions with with the community mr. Watson and I have been talking about that anyway you can update through so three applies to both come here can we just um clarify something in terms of the prices the the first precipitous decision in four reports we had last month is do we want it to clear property surplus and sell them now that that is the truth of the process where does at the underlying designation we 're absolutely obliged I thinking in then you 've got the seeking worth of properties which is let 's hold these for strategic purpose to be worked on over the third group which is we think these would be suitable for community uses or community uses of public uses let 's work and come up with a if I 'm poking out properly around maybe do your toes tall and the Heskett rights properties I think the category therein is good what I 'm hearing is you want to prioritize those and have them looked at sooner rather than later you know sorry I don 't think it needs being meet the resolutions are mended but what it what it is as a message to staff community board that we cranked on the first ones is a priority and the Sun agency well if we can get any out if we can get that you know assertion that I suppose then we 'll have to follow it up and as I I hope the community will follow that up yeah but I mean that this is a is asking us to delegate authority to the community board to make the decision for retention for alternative views whereas I mean the community board might say no we better own it we back council new truth you know but you could you know and I mean the grecian is I don 't know I 've got I 've got no philosophical objection to the community board making making a decision but but I I kind of don 't want them to feel constrained around the delegated authority and that we would be probably prepared to consider you know selling out as we have done with other facilities I mean we 've either provided funding or we 've provided a facility to a community group who have taken it over and so that kind of discussion going on there that is that resolution for relates only to the properties and resolution to upon satisfaction of the issues and three so it 's only related to the third group of properties which is to look for alternate uses it 's varied to paragraph two sees support retention of the following property subject to the conditions in resolution 3 and then resolution 3 sees retention of the properties set out and resolutions 1 2 above so it doesn 't make sense to mount us if should just be one just be title well I don 't agree with it because these are whole lot more properties that should be in there know that resolution 3 should actually only say retention of the property see that so OCC outlined the eritrean fool relates to the two properties and resolution to there is no intention to give delegations or make decisions on the others apart from hold them for the purpose of being looking at more review in the future and those decisions will come back through the community board to Council this is where I got confused because three C 's retention of the properties set out and resolutions one and two yeah it should only be two but but we want you to go through a process of this for some of the properties and one core shall we I mean correct but that the decisions and one what are we going to do with those properly strategically they 're not to go out and look for alternate public uses so the community board of seen in terms of the two properties and two we you to go out and look those and they 've got to meet those criteria and bring back some decisions on future public uses the the properties in the first category are not hey we want to look for alternate public uses they require so much higher strategic decisions do we want to hold them do we want to sell them those sort of things so that would be a separate line of work that 's a separate line of work and end at a highest fatigue level whereas the ones in I definitely go out and find another public use we want to keep those in council ownership and we want to look at alternate public uses for and we 're not saying that with properties of money if then keep them and council ownership for a future strategic purpose yeah yes yeah so the workers to identify that strategic purpose or not there 's that she need to be identified so what these saying is we don 't think these properties should be a sole will be used for another public purpose until we really have a good they actually go on let 's sell them we 've got some other ideas we want to useful yeah it 's not a final decision tonight but I think those properties retention we 're delegation to the community boards I think if you look at in terms of these a list of properties and one is we don 't want them to let sell the other one is we want to use them for minute public uses and the other one is we 're not sure if I think there is a way for you don 't need to change the delegation the resolution and is recommended there if you look at number three e that is the key hurdle it needs to be addressed and for sites such as if your concern is an unused example that board might besides they want to retain the your house wall but council might choose to have a different approach in fact e comes into play because there is no budget set aside apart for demolition so the pause won 't have that delegation because there is no funding established you 'll after defunding and it was the same pretty sure the Heskett Road we don 't contain I have to scrimp and save to find any money B we have in there because there 's no allocation and long term plan for the maintenance of assessment Road property so that becomes the key restriction and leave the recommendation as is and the board 's recommendations and passed Council for consideration I 'm just I mean I 'm not wanting and you know you 've been very helpful thank you for there I 'm I 'm just I 'm thinking that there was a pretty strong submission as I recall and I don 't have any of the facts in front of me in relation to the autist Memorial Hall that I 'm hearing from the community board chair that there are an active conversation with the community rather than including us on a resolution that states that we want to approve the retention of it for a future strategic purpose when we have money on budget just to demolish it I would I 'd much rather just say provide further advice advice on your is Memorial Hall five to four pound road once the discussions have been had with the local community that says if you go to the tree that we 're teaching of these properties and as long as for public use it can be rationalized said it 's satisfy satisfies a clearly identified need and they 're supported by us and robust does in this case and that is that is what 's happening now is that community you 're trying to put together a sound robust business case if they can 't then it will come back and we may we may and start considering other options for this or this we 're it set because what I 've been told is that the expression yeah cleric plural resolution one end is not what the report was mean saying it was only mean three is only meant to apply to two we were quite happy with it at a community board to accept the staff recommendation without change because we 'd had workshops we had workshop on it we 've been visited all the sites we had us we were comfortable and as a majority is to adopt the staff recommendation were there change well but I 'm gonna move an amendment then because I 'm I just think that classifying it as approving the retention of it for a future strategic purpose today is not necessary when we 're having conversations with the community and I think it would show good faith to the community that we highlighted the author 's Memorial Hall that we said that we wanted further advice once the once the local community had had an opportunity to provide some unput I mean it 's just I just think that would seemed a very good message to the local community I think this thinkin 's fun yeah thanks yeah well probably I had perceived through through the discussions appealed is with us thing to come back to the business plan through the board I mean and they do really counsel remembering that the board is hint made a recommendation get demolished it came to council and that was yeah so they did seven months of of research and having a look at who put it on hold the council did December December last year company for presenter visa issue particular so this is why why do we want to include it on a resolution approving the retention of it when we haven 't had that meeting at the time the council resolved at that time to do it embark on this process which was doing what this is with this would anyone diamond does if I was to just cross it out okay delete me sure yeah okay your city to move yes and seconded by Vicki right any discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's Carrie _"

    "text": "and we 'll move on to the Denson Park paper did you want to make a comment about that or I was actually going to get the chair of the on I suppose it 's no it 's alright okay yeah if you did you want to make a comment about it then that was our board resolution to receive the the hearings panels recommendation and with with with an addition and when that was some when that was put it was putting unanimously at the board so and I 'm just quite happy to and with the help of Sarah if need be to answer any questions I understand that there 's going to be another resolution added to this one which says that request staff to report back to the 13th of September 2018 council meeting on a process for progressing as quickly as possible the assessment of site options and the development of the proposed library service center and Southwest Leisure Centre and Hornby notwithstanding the earlier decision to approve Denton Park as the preferred location is the process is that the process from here as made enormous delay in there do we need to revoke the earlier decision but actually we don 't need advice based on their decision not to change reserved stages we could simply revoke the decision of the 21st 24th of August 2017 and request staff to report back on a new process in terms of process Standing Orders says that any decision were in recommendation to revoke and earlier 75 ROM must come from the chief executive with two days working days notice now we haven 't done that and we weren 't contemplating doing that right now we just felt that we should at least note the fact that there had been that earlier resolution when we come back to you there will probably be a recommendation that we revoke that can we request after report back we 'll request the chief executive team to report back and it was at the six of September is that the appropriate date okay yeah so if we request the chief executive to report report back on a proposal to revoke the decision of the 24th of August and to provide advice on then get rid of the brackets yup with its got requests geotechnical investigations of car park so hang on there are some questions so I 'm going to have to so there was a council resolution all right so so there 's anyone 's got any questions of Mike and if not what will say thank you to you and then we 'll get I just want to know if a pair of five should be including paper three the papacy Hiawatha undertake a lost alert your Tecla investigation should be the first priority it 's on underway now okay how do we know it 's not undertaken just initiated a subcontractor with the possible the consulting company it 's easy as soon as possible there 's nothing there 's nothing further that we can do from a government perspective then ask for it to be done as soon as possible yeah yes because why I emphasize to this one life because the based on the possible location of this new facility to the pure actor based on the last year even though this year you know the capital times policy to so we need to count searching I 'm just going to ask that we don 't go into the the decision-making area so if we just focus on what this is and it 's requesting that the geotech investigations happen as quickly as possible staff of going out to tinder because it 's not something that we 've got internal expertise in relation to it will be going out to get a contractor to do that work for us immediately say thank you alright so reef yeah just following up what you said about the geotech there were two things though one thing you said it was happening right now and then you said it was going out for tender it 's going to come out the budget for the project okay are we gonna make a decision on that when we get the tender back in terms of how much it 's gonna cost to do the geotech normally that would be delegated to the that the project team you wouldn 't expect the council 's because it was a big number that was another thinking with assessment of the site okay options are you adjoint there was part of a tissue that we need to actually go back and relook at all of those things it says it that the development of the proposed Library Service Central and Letcher Center yeah and my doesn 't say one site one doesn 't say one into two okay it did come back to us for a decision yes I made either which way everything comes back now for a decision thank you I just question this is very eerie Yanni so your your image has now been restored so far away I just it 's really a question of both the board and the staff but you know it 's really important that we aim to continuously improve how we make good decisions is it any concerning any consideration given to some sort of review of this whole process to see what lessons we could learn from it as I understand it staff are getting together and working through the process that 's been followed and where could be improved or any issues that might come out of mean I guess reasons so they imply solve the whole process around us and the additional costs we know incurring I do think maybe if we could get him a run wall so the listen saloon prices is on the way I think that would be really real thank you it will be done thank you all right good one more question investigation we go to the tender in the system I just want to know you know regarding coyopa wee-wee pub need to request for proposal to define clearly repressor possible contractor follow our request so my question sir which area how big area how people we need to either take this that you 'll take investigation and also I was told about the community whether we consider to one apiece penetrating the great assistant to eat more kind of thoughts thoughtfully this I suggest should be considered as part of our request for proposal it 's a great question late we just in the process of going out for a proposal so it 's far too early to answer that at the moment so we will come back keen to move forward as quickly as we can and we 're going out to the market for a proposal currently sir yes you need to consider these Westar should be consider these factory yeah now that meets all the any possible absolutely could because there is other stakeholders there we have got a BMX track there there is other impacted party so yeah we 'd absolutely thank you it 's great thank you all right so do

    "text": "[Music] right so could we have the horse world Hornby restaurant commuter board oh sorry accurately in capsules and I 'll talk about error and you name a white pune later on but anyway gives us great pleasure to present a community board report to you today and we have a part a Metis the recommendations of the that we approved the parking restrictions and normally that 's not a part i the first one is that we deploying the approval under but the we on the different and under the reserve act to learn to reclassify part of deep and pack which is a separate report coming later so i did try to seek guidance earlier in iran check before the meeting the end whether we to ask questions and at this at this part of the meeting or or after the opportunity to come to the table I when they 're better the reclassification of Denton parkus and is following in the area reporters so that 's that 's are you happy with that yes am i heavy with the table now and then we 're going straight with Denton Park at the end of at the end of your presentation that 's fine okay and in the approval of the reclassification so we 'll move on then to the and the next thing is the approval of heavy vehicle restrictions on various roads within their Ward that something that 's been an issue for quite a number of years actually is the inability to actually put police and those heavy vehicle restrictions but what we have now is the ability for on for the police for example to actually pull over a moving vehicle and issued them with an instant infringement notices so prior to this and it hasn 't been the case you 've actually had the summons somebody to court so we 're very very pleased with that progress and the other thing I just wanted to clarify is the approval to construct two pedestrian pathways on Richmond drainage Reserve two adjacent to and there 's a typo there it 's night 's stream school not Knight Street School so we 're very happy to produce to progress with that and the Ministry of Education on the end of the part I we were going to talk about just like to take this opportunity again to actually think that the panel the hearings panel and the staff that supported the hearings panel on this process and and I 'm sure all the submitters that took part in that by the for or against were very very grateful for the efforts and the way that was and that process was some carried out so I know I did thank them at the extraordinary meeting but it just take this opportunity now here today to to acknowledge the work of the penny and the staff supporting the penalty other significant term of the next year other significant projects and their board area or the strict and in communities funds projects which they 're um that being processed quite a lot of those being processed they 're out there Gary so we 're that 's a work in progress and the other partnerships with community community and organizations as a New Zealand Institute of Sport get set go workshop so I understand that 's been around other boards something that them that we 're really really pleased to run to give people the opportunity and as over sixty students have attended and tailored version their workshops specifically aimed at preparing them for future careers and working in community support community sport at least so that 's something that 's really really good moving on the end to the American opera kitten war memorial library that 's a work in progress still and so as the autist memorial hall so we 're still working with those communities to find resolutions and ma for words on both of those and warm and Memorial Library and War Memorial Hall and the the very exciting infrastructure project update is now pune why sports hub of course and you can see and the exciting colored photos has set them just a question and that i 'd like to ask if staff are in a vase there is some stained the green stained beams and and are they coming from Jade stadium because they look very similar to the ones that were above the pool Kelley steamed they 're not okay dokay just just car parks are all ready for use and the the tracks almost finished it all it needs us at the time of this report was the was the staggered lines of where you start so that the person on the outside of the track doesn 't have to run any different distance from the person on the inside lanes like you 're well aware of the athletes that have been running on track for a bit the holes will domain sky a skatepark update well that 's um that 's a work in progress but it 's due to be completed in December but the exciting thing is the night stream Carper art night 's dream skatepark update is not only coming on budget but two months early so just like to really congratulate the team on that and just let people know that if some they have problems with all sure they don 't say anything about that oh okay so anyway we 've been very very fortunate that we 've been able to actually achieve what we have and in night 's dream and it 's a wonderful now but it will be officially opened on Friday the 12th of October so because it 's been being done ahead of time we didn 't really want we didn 't really want to have it fenced off until then did we and the community didn 't so the barriers are down and people can use it so that 's um that 's a good use very good news Dean 's Rickett and Road update unless there 's any questions on that that 's pretty straightforward I think and but we 're just waiting till the contracts a lit for the next stage of Hera Tiki to Metta Pope so that we can set up with the contractor a way of communicating for the community to actually communicate with the contractor to to answer any questions or resolve any outstanding issues on the way and forward with this difficult engineering work moving on then to the wicket racecourse racecourse alcohol Ben so that 's something that comes around every year and maybe one of these days it 'll become permanent the Templeton community submission writing workshop with council staff and residents association to help them with compiling written submissions on decision and to the decision making process including resource consent applications and a long-term plan and local projects so I think that 's a really good initiative from staff to actually get involved with the residents association and help them just get the head around thinking about what might happen and when they if they need to make submissions win them selves and district fault and Hoeven actually or you 've saying times up I thought I was gonna have a little bit more serious thank you so that 's um that 's one year wonderful me that 's in the Rickett excuse me in the rec area for children aged between eight and thirteen years to think positively about themselves they 're working that the university have came to Bri on that one so that 's um that 's a good news story and the capsules graffiti program of course is ten years old so there 's an invitation to tell them inventing and coming up on that and the community service the woods we did touch briefly on this the the information on the community service and youth awards that we held in the Rickett and racecourse tes and we were and we were entertained by the Iranian society with their excellent dancing I 'm moving on to the hollow horn the event down to the next one yet next year and March next year as some of the planning for that is underway and now as we speak and other matters progress you know in the community plane and community board and that is of interest I 'd just like to briefly say that because it 's mentioned here about the area around the old Eddington sale yards but it 's quite exciting that that the University of actually doing a study out they into fly-tipping home in our Ward and they 've asked their community board members for for area so it 'll be interesting and they they 're going to give the feedback to this for that fly-tipping investigation to our board so and will probably have a great feature and passing it on to the council as well as what they discover from that student volunteer army and that 's that 's a star group and it 's really really pleased to see that that Sun that 's sort of gone viral to started here in Christchurch as we know and at the time of the earthquakes but it 's it 's grown there too it 's not only students as other people involved in that as well and it was really moving to see the partnership with the with the majorie Stoneman Douglas high school and some of the survivors from that tragedy coming out here and and being involved with our student volunteer army and community and planting some trees and horse walk quarry and recognition of that very very Genevieve so that 's and the other thing is of course the helpful hand random facts this wife my wife penny which is some wife of water in Pune for spring is very very appropriate for our bare water and we 're very grateful to receive that at our last board meeting and we because we do have the headwaters of the of the three rivers starting from Springs and our Ward interesting to know that the Rickett and stream goes a lot of people don 't realize that the guys directly flows directly under the westfield war and then pops back out on the other side of Division Street yeah yeah yeah so anyway there we are I won 't ask is there any questions because that 's for you to ask me like a two questions first one regarding to the hollow home be this my understanding that this year when we organized committee members but you win date under where the hope in Western Association they were not yet you know establish I suggest this time next year we should consider invite their chair or their committee member as in part of the committee member no yes in a hobby area yep we can make that we can we afford to realize that that committee is not lead by counsel it 's lead by the community so the community will decide who is on the committee in council staff if no involvement in it okay secondaries are because of coming for meeting on 24 that you like have me know a local group in for those that are the heavy recall you mentioned earlier yeah I just want to know there 's a party or party a because today I didn 't see this information that 's area that 's part it 's not a part i it 's okay to be happy that when will be the tech in fact i think it 's effective as of already there are there I 'm not sure yeah because already yesterday I got a phone call you know from say me the CMAs street races this year contender heavy motor because they 're pursue it so now you JWA thank you yep the wolf on there officially but my understanding currently little bit effective names or just wanted to sort is already there brother so I 'm the dude already has been for quite enough a few years actually it 's just being difficult to enforcement that 's Aaron did you have a question yeah I just did around Mike on the property review process Commission come around all the boards and your boards opted to retain everything we opted dealing with it secretly yeah I can 't wait so could we I 'll put the emotion all those in favor say aye those opposed they no on it carry _"

    "text": "okay and the next one is the pulmonary and a community board go the Crusaders just quietly okay so I 'll make very good or inlet yep thank you very much for having us along today I look at the Swami thank you not a lot actually I just want to say that I think that the finish and why Mary here wood board has set a very high bar would be presentations today but quite clearly has too much time on their hands and possibly too much budget so [Laughter] yeah look there 's a lot happening in the community at the moment with community groups and youth agencies in the area one organization that we have a lot to do with and has a lot to do with us is the Papa new youth development which continues to provide brilliant programs and events and partnership with the local youth agencies to order ho the Belfast community network and North City and py Jesus standout youth facility in Christchurch and it was built in partnership which of course is really important and it strengthens the the organization and those Christchurch City Council and the Anglican Church and they provide within PYD for the youth in the area a craft room radio station a climbing wall basketball courts computer Suites PlayStation room and recording studios so it 's a really fantastic facility for the youth in our area and they 're very well connected as well and well respected and trusted because that 's a really important part of the relationship they have a new program at PYD it 's called PR k which is ascend into new heights and it offers breakfast and mentoring sessions along with the life skills program legacy that operates under case Brook Intermediate School and it also works together with some reasonably high-profile sports people too which is a great connection to have two of the things happening in our ward at the moment is well this is an extra one actually it 's this is our sand albans park and pavilion project the pavilion is ahead well that the project is overall behind but only because of the weather and what the effect is on the on the grass growing and I mean but the Pavilion is just about done and we 've got a board visit to the pavilion this Friday and this was put together the program was developed the building I was was signed off after talking to groups in the area and finding out what they needed in the building and that was a really good process I think the board kind of went yeah we need changing rooms here we need a kitchen but actually when we talk to the groups it was clear that space could be better utilized so that was a really good project or process as well don 't talk to me about color right just moving on drawing a discreet veil over these and almonds parking public and color scheme we 'll move to the next image which we 're still getting that Wells not still we always get some really cool stories coming back from youth and our ward as well I have to say that mi Norrish the Deputy Chair has really picked up you know the mantle on on the youth for now as she understood I vote for Paula area of youth engagement and we 're seeing this with these two that came to see it 's Travis Baldwin and Kalyn Lewis talked about what a huge difference in their lives this project made going on the spirit of adventure trophy and I think it was Travis 's mum was there and and she said that she saw a really amazing positive change in Travis when he came back from it just um did she say it 's keeping his room tidy I think the space that they had on the on the boat was so small that they had to we really had to keep it tight but you know these young people come and talk to us they put together a presentation and they look us straight in the eye and I think most of the board would agree that this is one of the the highlights of the work that we do on the board is hearing that feedback from the young people in our ward a lot of planting going on in the ward at the moment this is the Matariki dawn planting that was again very wet I mean it 's been a wet last few weeks actually and then we had some more planting at the Capitol Oak Creek and that was with the University of Florida students which got a bit of media coverage as well and another planting day on the 25th and that 's board member John stringer in the top right there he went along to represent the board who worked with the student army on this so a couple of things just wanted to raise before we finish there are two main bits of work going on in the water at the moment as far as consultation goes the first one is the Cranford Street downstream effects management plant project now unless it 's been sent to all submitters and look I have to say we have found that there are four or five submitters that have not received those letters so we 're just following up where that gap is and why that happened we received four hundred and seven submissions in total and on August the 6th which is next Monday the community board is giving they 'd like to be heard the process here is that there is an independent engineering expert dr. Shane TuneIn he 's going to attend the meeting on Monday he will then draft a report which will be referred to you as councillors and will then proceed to a council decision but that decision will be consulted on again within the community something that we 're making very clear in all of our communications at the moment is that we are consulting above and beyond what is normally required for a project like this and that 's because we know how important this project is to everyone in the ward and how controversial it is let 's be frank it 's it 's getting a bit of coverage and there are we 're not going to please everyone on this we know that but we 're not required to consult to this level the the condition and the designation for the road does make clear that the board or the council has to consider mitigation for this project so it 's actually part of the designation so we think that the other one is the bus thank you the bus priority on main or throat and that is quite I don 't to use the word fort it is a controversial part of or one of the controversial consultations in our ward at the moment as well there 's been some reports on removal of parking and things like that and as you will know that 's often an issue that sort of gets people going but that 's about all at the moment we are finding that there is a huge pressure on our ward staff they are all working extremely hard helping with the newsletter helping with the inquiries that we 're getting and the engagement that we 're getting from members of the community we have made clear as a board that if there are concerns or issues around workload that that needs to be communicated to us we cannot be dropping balls when it comes to these important consultations and engagement with the community and so we want to make sure that that doesn 't happen any more than it is at the moment and I different consultation so I 'm really pleased to see that the community boards engaging at the same time as they can on the changes to the bus route which was part of a successful campaign I think by the retirement village in there to get the bus rerouted with the changes that are happening in the area to ensure that older people could catch the bus and staff could catch the bus to use it 's there it 's good but why they no but no bus stops signs outside the shops that I go to I 'm down on this road cherlene currently yeah surely you 're not going to take the parking outside that little bit of shops and put a bus stop here ie that is part of the process in the suggestion at the moment but that is not the that 's our consultation yes so why did the Community Board choose that as the location for the bus stop we didn 't we were presented with that as the consultation or the the project that they were consulting on but it 's it 's our to be perfectly honest the community board was unaware that there would be that number of parks or indeed any parts removed from there we do have a little bit of good well we have much concern actually about this consultation we feel that it is we are consulting whether you can at the same time but it seems confused and my opinion anyway and some of the community aren 't aware of who 's consulting on which button to whom they send their information to as far as the loss of the parking goes and I think the councillors might like to speak on this I know that Mike Davidson 's been engaged with the businesses down there we 've been back through the presentation that we had at the community board and I have checked with the staff we do not recall being told that they were going to be up to eight car parts removed from outside those shorts and eight car parks equates to the entire length of those shops just about so I 've been telling you as well but I mean we the community going to go along with you know but this is what this is what I 'm confused about was the community board did the community board actually sign off on the point no so can anyone tell me why that was the case because it 's the community boards role to sign off on the consultation that we didn 't delegate or the we don 't have the power to delegate that to he can as I understood it from the joint committees point public transport committees perspective it was agreed that it would be excellent to consult the community at the same time that doesn 't mean that you delegate the decision-making to someone else so who decided the who decided what went out to the public as far as the location of the bus stops the engagement team because the community board we had a briefing we didn 't see the final consultation short briefing from 1800 and and we were not his seed we were not made aware that there was going to be carpark losses outside those businesses we knew that and it was not brought seems to have been some sort of well we we have delegation and Christine 's going to follow this up from a staff perspective it 's video perspective today I think what is really important here to and I 'm so glad you phrased it that it came to us essentially signed and sealed and ready to go and actually signed and sealed without the full information so when we as board members and as our counselors engage with residents either face-to-face or via email it is very embarrassing to be informed of something of which we are unaware by the people who are affected by it so yeah there 's certainly a problem and the process here and Christina I 'll be following up from a staff perspective but we will be from well I just saw I saw the signs yeah it is a shopping area that I go to frequently one very good coffee at Martha 's cafe and two I often buy flowers at the flower shop you 're right and not that I eat fish and chips very often but they 're very good as handy little shopping center but it is completely dependent on parking there are several issues that have come out of this that raised concerns and we are following them okay well that 's my submission thank you Europe so Tim I could just Channel Yanni for a couple of minutes well I 'll do a minutes rather than a couple and we frequently get and seen through consultations is a heads up so we get an email saying hey we 're about to go and consult on this this is what the documents are and we don 't get to sign them off as a board and our yannis been asking and we 've been asking as a board ralphie frequently now to say hey can it come to us for sign off before it goes out for consultation but usually it doesn 't at least we get it heeds up at fair enough heat of time for us to say hey does and we 're not happy with us please to gate things that wouldn 't go to a community board for sign-off first but there are other things 's absolutely crystal clear it 's the decision-making sits with the community board and they should have signed off landscape plans for what we do some of the things that are mutable delegations and they don 't come to us first I not focus I mean we have to look at what all of them are so anyway Phil Leanne I 've raised this issue a number of times but I think it 's time it 's really time that we 've got Cara fication about the process of signing off all the consultations where they go in especially when if for example it 's a community board project whatever the resident survey we did you know Christians about satisfaction etc so we 've gotta be so careful when we go out for consultation we do a lot of it so I 'm just surprised with this when you ask for going to consultation and you ask for submissions there 's another standard to say and if you would like your submission heard or if you would like to be heard but now it seems that this wasn 't done to say if you 'd like to be here know know what it was was it was it was always communicated that you would be able to speak to your submission the letter is just to confirm the date that time and would you like to book because when you 've got 407 submissions and at the moment I think we 're sitting at around 25 or 30 people coming and to talk we need to essentially have an RSVP system so it was always made clear and all of the collateral and information about the process that people would be able to speak to this semester but surely we would do should do that in one go because we 're doubling up staff time and the fact of it well the trouble I mean and that this is where I 'll go back to signing off on consultation documents the original consultation document didn 't sit out it sit out a timeline but it didn 't set out you know we 're doing this because we 're required to by a resource consent condition you know there 's going 's going to be sitting in on the hearings are we talking about two different things are you talking about Cranford Street yeah yeah so he 's talking about the least of the wind out to the submitters after the submissions were this is for Cranford Street CNC downstream that 's what I 'm talking about I beg your pardon sorry yes correct but the downstream yep the original consultation document didn 't set out what was actually why didn 't set out the why what why are we doing at this particular way right you know that there 's an independent expert being appointed and blow up like what the Lita has done has actually set all of that out so it 's actually explained the process which wasn 't done in the original consultation document which is good yeah you know that the explanation letter as excellent but I think also too because this is such a long process and you 'll all be aware how long the cncs been going we need to be regularly re engaging with your community as well because you can 't send assume that it 's on people 's radar as that date approaches so that is why having an email tree as well and constantly sending updates I mean the implications for the downstream effects won 't be implemented until there 's been a you know sort of a 30% increase in traffic or something like that as a result of the downstream effects taking place so we 're talking 2020 and beyond so it 's not something that 's going to happen overnight it 's something that 's going to be know but with respect we need to also be ready to implement it or even be implementing it prior to it becoming a problem because the last thing we want to be doing is putting something in in an area where the traffic has increased 30% I thought I was quoting from it was consent but I might have it wrong yeah do we lose them to begin before yeah it has to be in before the arterial opens yes mr. ocean yeah so we won 't wait for the problem to present itself we have to have it there were more layers to it there no you 're right there are because there are varying levels of mitigation the exact criteria anyway so um so who Pauline my second dude so I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carrot thank you thank you _"

    "text": "in Kashmir community board here at at oh um I just wanted to mention briefly apropos why Mary federal term when they talked about the Manik butterflies we 've had the same person in our ward commenting about the number of butterflies that have been killed and we 've given the project two hundred and fifty dollars from our off the ground fund to ring the relevant trees with steel to stop the rats getting up and killing the butterflies we have like other places do significant trees in various perhaps of our Ward that house the butterflies over winter and it 's been quite apparent that they 're not there this winter I just want to comment briefly before we start on the the grants it 's just it 's just the difference between a small award and a smaller board area sorry and the row here of the larger boards is that our grants took up a page this year and it used to be several pages and we do miss those projects in those areas and those suburbs that we have lost and but we still contribute over the way in central now but whose work and benefits our community too but we hope that if there 's any more redrawing of the boundaries ordinarius become more import we are in the middle of the of the long-standing river bank stabilization program and the water engineers came to see us again as they always do to present brilliantly as they always do on the changes that are going to be occurring further down the history of our in terms of our bank stabilization it is remarkable some of the changes are occurring to the history the widening of the river is a really apparent in some of our areas now and it demonstrates how the rivers were deliberately narrowed and how that has contributed to the flooding that has occurred in recent years and the widening of the river gives it much more natural appearance when we walked from the service center at beacon them over to look at the river the river was tumbling down between its banks and looked very that doesn 't look as natural as it 's going to look because of the but growth often of the plantings will make a difference but the river was tumbling down opposite the super City you almost felt as though you could have kitchen kitchen not me of course but in the kayak and have a race down the river and the outward appearance of the river is much more natural and we 're seeing that we were all really seeing the benefits of it it 's a pity that we can 't even make them wider in some areas some of our rivers of course drains instead of being a natural looking river it will be interesting to see if and when they do changes for instance and the spray-tanned domain it would be interesting to see it looking with reference to it some the banks and the spray-tanned domain it picked those anywhere near there but it 's a pleasure to have the drainage guys during the presentation on this and a consultation and the community generally speaking responds really well with the drainage guys respond they also consult with us on their plantings our board favors native tree plantings and especially the Ren we will and we have had support from the water engineers on this as well and every Power there we often see far too often actually contractors putting in random trees and random places on their riverbanks they just appear and they 've got no there 's no design or seeming intent and one Cypress appeared down at the heath got near the SPO reserve the Eskimo preserve his recent them the location where residents Association has recently become the continuity of the escrow reserve and they are restoring the native plantings in it and doing such a good job and there are three calorie ending of the God 's sake and so they 're working really hard in there and all of a sudden the Cypress appears and they asked why and we had a great response from the arborist who when his head the Cypress removed but I don 't know why those random plantings occur well we launched on July the fourth the age-friendly sprayed and Kashmir project when I hear the word sage really I want to risk my head gently on the DS and emanates from Wellington and the senior citizens office calls have age friendly I do hope we change it I made an introductory remarks that referred to the fact that this generation that is aging now are the generation that invented sex drugs and rock and roll and I 've often said that and this is a generation that was a generation when generations weren 't talked about in the and when this group were born in post-world War two generations weren 't remarked on teenagers didn 't exist generations now exist ad infinitum and this generation isn 't going to tolerate and crap that gets delivered to older people I have great hope that this generation makes a nuisance of itself as they have done before and I 'm hoping that they 'll lead the way for the aging generations to come of which you are all members and that they will cause a bit of a stir in our neighborhood to ensure that aging is not treated the way it has been in the past and just treated as inevitable and bold and it 's actually fun and I we had Diane Turner from the senior citizens office and Simon Templeton from Age Concern and Helene mountain are presenting to the audience but I 'm hoping that an ends they did a great job and it was great to have them there but I am hoping that the group when it 's convened and starts at work starts to think adventurously and was excitement about the aging and just apropos there yesterday at and there were people there from here the housing network had case level Smith speaking about the aging and rental properties and the decline in home ownership from the beginning of the century 2000 to now is startling and it 's most startling and the 40 to 45 90 billion so the housing issues thank God the Christchurch City Council of all local bodies leads in talking about housing and social housing and I 'm really personally very grateful for their and the spreading commit carry we used to have for instance an event in Barrington Park but the staff recognized and the staff recognized this before we elected members probably that no longer looked like an supporter of community development they recognized that they that they who participated in this bid we were becoming increasingly commercial and there was no longer groups of people and enjoying community development so they were that we 've we 've came that particular event but ask the community to think of events that they appear about and that would support community development in their area and to support that the community development staff have a get go get set go workshop to talk to community groups about community development and about event management and we 've had considerable success in the for instance the rally community in developing the the project around the basketball lights and and making the hoenn a fiesta a much larger event and the rugby league has become involved the person including the Pacific festival and the schools in that area have become involved and the schools in that area become involved because the the their cultural event that 's held for schools is too expensive for them it 's too expensive for them so they are developing their own program around una Fiesta and their energy and drive that 's coming from the community and we 've probably are finding it very very interesting and I actually must get to go to one of those and workshops myself and actually learn something about it too weird the community board pamphlet is being developed after melds Ned for six years I think and will be going out with us with the second rates notice and will no doubt after people have sat down quietly on receiving their rates notice and might become more conscious in terms of reading something will no doubt be taken up with interest by the people who receive it and the and the final thing on the same day is the citizens sorry as the age-friendly we presented to Jeremy agar of the Summit Road Society in their ears a very large check for 45,000 for predator-free and we were absolutely delighted Jeremy had a tear in his eye he has worked so hard on this project it was led by him the Summit Road society was originally a bit thoughtful about the effort it might take and whether they could collecting but on their the weekend after Jeremy got took the chip off us for 45,000 for predator-free there were over 200 people at a workshop it 's in Martin 's school on how to become predator-free it 's a triumph in our area I know it 's a triumph elsewhere in Canterbury but in our area we 've taken this issue on at a personal level and we are thrilled with the results thrilled with the Summit Road society very proud of Jeremy 's work and the work that he 's put into the Summit Road society and the wider community everywhere on predator-free and there are some of the kids as well we 've got some t-shirts for a separate prize on how on drawing designer to design a t-shirt and they 've got a separate prizes on the designs of their t-shirts and about predator-free so instead it must be statistics tell me you 'd like to make Danton oh and just note the end and we didn 't take up the time you know the time we only took out we didn 't take up time on two minutes thank you but congratulations to the board I just think going out and actually engaging with the community about how they can take control of things that sir it 's it 's wonderful so really congratulations very much felt willing Karen look thank you for your report and you 've touched on I guess some quite high level strategic issues turn if it comes to older people and short of housing began affordable and it 's just how and preps them and you City acknowledge them Council of a strong history in their social we Algeria I 'm just wondering well considering how in fact we have all this joined up the work that our Housing Committee do and Kim was at the seminar yesterday too and and that the group that the age friendly group in Kashmir and then of course what we really need is that as the case they will said this how in fact we make sure that the silos its central government level are broken down some every government department is involved with this issue but perhaps it 's something for future to my tensions the Eberly Park issue but it 's a start response they could not actually 100% confirm that it was read his you brought us those questions about what a big the same woman came in our board area and she is very firm that it is red because they wings are left and the bodies are gone even even though I know she gave us bonus but even though staff come back and see it 's not an airport so do they think it is Ritz and the other thing is we need to get the feedback on we know the Rings are actually working and because it seems to be that it 's citywide it is so you 've got super alien you 've got Emily Park in Boone side part just the three that have been noted know what bacon and packs got a huge monarch butterfly dreams no machine the rest don 't recognize the ward boundaries what I 'm saying is that and it could actually be it could actually be an aftermath of the quake as well because we did have a probably moving outwards there used to be a really big tree and the bee would Pegasus area around their way around Lake Terrace Road it was a bad tree he was monarchs on it I don 't know if they still do you think Pauline we should get a staff members just hanging around doing nothing and I 'm just trying to work out with the chief executive as is there a committee that this can get a report back to so that I mean this work there 's a working group going on so there 's a working group within Council so it is being addressed we could have a monarch yes yeah yeah okay so so is it possible to arrange a briefing for the for the AG committee just on we 're the programs up to involved in this and so and we 'd be good to take him to those people who already have some knowledge like yeah can do here is that there is a group with own council that is addressing this yeah so we 'll just get an update report through to a the community boards because it will be across the city yeah yep okay thank you hey trick yes thank you thank you very much it 's very thank you we 've moving right along so it 's been moved by term seconded by Phil I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's careful _"

    "text": "okay your emails might been warm welcome got my Brenham blink on today just to remind people to wear their red and black tomorrow yes so but tomorrow 's that work days so for everyone to wear really black so I 'm putting the challenge out there and now I 'd like to invite this ok still bear with Ward t5 good morning Lee and 4 thank you and councillors the first one obviously is a Deltan bridge safety concerns the community came to us and the recent Association excetera said this from big concerns about safety and accidents that 's Nexus and just recently so we 're actually working with them and we have an on-site meeting with an engineer plant so it 's something we 're looking at at the moment well the new broken clock tower as you probably know it 's head scaffolding around up quite a long time and we now actually sing some action which is great the faces you can see the clock tower face they 've been taken out and they have to be repaired so I guess it 's a pretty but there has been some damage found in the actual stone building itself and there 's been repaired so it looks like it 's about a year-long job behind that of course you know we 've just had the excuse me the Brighton Pier fixed and I just must tell you that and the first month that was open after it was opened again we had eight thousand plus people in the first month and the numbers are building up again which is great to see something positive happening again the tree removal set new brought in pack this has been an ongoing issue for quite a while we had an it we had a council arborist come down just recently and had a look at the trees and I think I mentioned at a previous meeting I was quite concerned about 30 odd trees coming down and this stays there the arborist seemed to think that could be up to a hundred that needs to come down I think move scaled their back now to the most urgent ones which is about nine but it 's a bit concern on the other side of the walkway and they 've died not from self intrusions through the ground but they 're the water 's coming in on particularly high tides and ponding around the tree roots so we 're now getting into obviously concede damage to the East Ridge that 's erosion and it 's obviously a big issue but it 's a concern we 're leading blues and trees further in with the ponding of the salt water because you know so what is just as I said it 's just sitting there for up to a week after a big event I 'd so we 'd love to work forward that one it 's just going ongoing saga and we don 't seem to be getting anywhere with it this one is this is the fall short this is a combined thing with them it 's got be see a landscape public out and they 're getting together to try to find out what they can do will come up some ideas what they can do with their particular area as you know it 's always been bit the idea is to see what they can do and see what improvements can be made the community board will some of the members are working with that as well oh this is the hub that look this was a great event I 've definitely a really chilly Sunday one of the few cold days we have down here but it it was a cracker day as far as people coming along and Glen was there and Joan perfect all the community board and councillors were there great turnout as you can see there we had that but we got a picnic on the other side of the road there 's been a steady stream of people coming to the regenerate hub a lot of people are not going because they think nothing 's going to happen and that 's quite sad really and I 'm having to kind of almost knock on doors and convince people to come along I think it 's because it 's been so long winded there 's been despondency in the area but again at the same time there are people coming along so a bit further than that the community needs some quick ones if you know there 's not a lot of hoping out there at the moment which is is quite sad to hear I believe I think oh yeah this other one here is some obviously the issue of South Shore and as you probably all know rum you know this case is the where people can 't build and there 's still people there who haven 't been able to build and still with a lot of money tied up in their sections and consenting and all this stuff and can 't build and I don 't know how you 'd feel but if you had a lot of money tied up and you don 't know how you can get out of the out of this position because you cannot build you cannot sell your section and your 300,000 down so there was a case as you know ever and Red Cliffs last week they 'd wait for their person who was trying to build but it didn 't really set an example which was disappointing so look board Council and resins have got to work together and get some of these things fixed there 's too many half-finished projects or projects that aren 't going anywhere at the moment and it 's affecting the community and this is why I think the numbers are down at the regenerate they could be a lot more because you know one of the things you 've got to do out there is give people with some hope and we 're not doing that we 're not getting projects finished people want to know they 've got a future for the families themselves and also hope so there are two most important things future and hope if we can give them a bit of that we 'll move forward but until we get something sorted out Easter itself bright and South Shore building we 're going to have this pleasure it 's not the right way to move forward so I 'm not sure the right way forward I 'm not sure what it is but we have to work together somehow and get at least some of these issues solved meeting all the time talking about the same things it 's about it thank you thank you sorry I 'm just wondering if there 's a communication issue here so I mean there 's always I mean across the city there 's a never-ending list of things that need doing but you know we 've opened Toyota Kiwi to the piers first you 've got your brand new playground the hot saltwater palms are on the way yes are we not celebrating that enough if you think that people know we 're not doing anything for the UN I cannot speak higher you know about those they 're wonderful they are after that but it 's but those things up like pluses but when you start playing with people 's lives livelihoods yeah that 's the difference because the message you 're saying is that people feel like we 're not doing anything no no I 'm probably okay no Creek there yeah there is great things happening in the yeah Paul look at the polls the schools you know there is some great things happening I 'm not talking the minuses are yeah so don 't get me wrong with people who thankful for those and there was hope in that respect but I 'm talking about the people that some of these things actually actually affect like loans insurances it 's a different issue to what you 're talking about yeah very very grateful and Bri think well you won 't get anybody who will say anything against those things I think maybe I mean is the regeneration stuff but actually the the those that are coastal hazards issues a district plan getting that sorted it was a coastal business we 're seem to be loggerheads over the ear streets in South Brighton and in South Shore and we 've got this building issue no no it 's our prawns house will probably have the most issues at the moment so I 'm not really referring to the whole each time referring to a particular area but there is a process that 's going on there so we 've got the but a methodology has been devised by the community for the community and what the community around 're not easy you know and I don 't think that these are there 's a magic solution that is going to solve for now and for the future and the the whole approach around adaptive management means shared knowledge shared understanding and a shared vision for the future but also a really powerful capacity within a community to adapt and change direction because we don 't actually know what the future holds and it 's a vulnerable environment on both sides of the eastery although I 'd rather be on your side than on the other side Eric I mean the reasons themselves mostly live day to day and this is what 's affecting them it day to day and you know I totally understand that and another thing we 're working towards but you know I 'm talking at grain level I 'm talking with the residents all the time what I 'm hearing now in ITIF I talk to them a lot it 's not like they 're moving forward and I mean let aside what you see before about the good things that are happening but to leave it to the insurance industry to decide the future of [Music] coastally environment or environments and christchurch but but do we have to work with the insurance industry yes we do we do because they are going to be doing their own assessments they are going to be determining what is vulnerable they are going to be determining what they 're going to charge by way of excesses and what they 're going to charge for premiums and they are going to decide not to cover some things so we need to we need to be quite collaborative in the space the reinsurers have been looking at this for a very very long time to be honest they probably had never heard of christchurch before September 2010 but they do now and they 're very aware of multiple hazards so it 's not just one hazard it 's multiple hazards in heaven conversations with communities that are already still stressed because of the effects of the earthquakes which are still not resolved is a very very tricky thing to do which is why we 've gone for a is going to be I hope a template for the rest of New Zealand for dealing with coastal environments but you know we 're on a journey and we 're when we 're a we way down the track but not very far down the track so I 'm extremely hopeful that the model that we 've developed will actually really help develop understanding about those environments but how you build communities that are capable of acceptance of the need to change when that change occurs and that may be many many many years in the future and another generation but we have to set it up now for those decision-making environments to exist we 've got a temporary bond fixing protecting people and South Shore well insurance companies don 't recognise temporary as a real fix so that 's one of the issues we 've got as well yep and these are the issues which we 'll be able to be resolved over over time as we look at the different components I mean you know as well as I do that the entire history environment is not the and certainly the sputters different on the on the beach side with an accreting Beach so there are there are multiple issues that need to be resolved down there and it 's not just a one-size-fits-all solution I think you know because we people down there been living with it for so long it 's just a shift frustration of it 's been getting harder and harder yeah I think since we getting done and this one I 'm quite disappointed that there should be more people going to this regenerate hug they are going but because they think nothing 's gonna happen that 's a terrible attitude to have and this one unfortunately some people have yeah no but a serious point was right is that it 's communication communication good education and and I I do understand that there is some communication really to be lifted in the next week or so so to really drive things help people understand the environment that they 're living in and the challenges of resolving some of those issues for the future it is a hard area but I 'm not not but we 're absolutely with them and we don 't want to have the insurance industry make decisions for the future we want to work with the insurance industry but primarily we want to work with communities so that they understand they have to be addictive living in their environment nothing that can happen okay and I 'm quite clear you know I said before there are some great things happening in our side of town antastic Thanks and don 't get me wrong but you know with good things we 've also got some bad things keep it in balance here but you cannot forget that there 's with the good things there 's also some brief difficulties for people yep I 'm not doing a moan I 'm not saying there are issues out there and there 's some great things happening and I 'm also trying to say that that we do hear those we 're very aware of them and we really do want to enable communities to take control of what our major decisions that are going to affect the future living environments and area but on the other side of the history as well and then all around the banks for lunch were so in actually New Zealand yeah I 'm sorry but I 've kind of overdone it but just wonder that that 's because the wheels turn so slowly but there 's so much investigative group that needs to be done I know in studies for years so it 's about conveying that to the people which is being done but you can 't see it yet yes there is work and we 've all been briefed on work that 's been done and that is going to be going out into the community for them to be looking at and the next couple of weeks so he bandaged up the regeneration strategy and you know regenerate Christchurch is leading the work the advantage of a regeneration strategy is that we have the ability to change aspects of our district plan through a regeneration plan so it is a better approach it is a way more engaged approached and it doesn 't involve multiple appeals to the Environment Court so that dealing with challenging issues where we 're looking to the future and not just looking at the present-day environment thank you for your time thanks very much thank you guys sorry dear I just the end Hutchison 's might one yep hello is that okay yep I mean sorry I forgot that you were there and it some other people have so I just want to just mr. price I think the idea of setting up local spaces where people can go and get information is a really positive so as they 're sitting up local shops or pop-up shops pop-up spaces in communities where people can go is actually really good and I think we should be considering doing more of it but that 's what I think that 's that 's why they 've got there you know I just wasn 't ready good idea yes okay regenerate Kashyap 's has done that right I 'm sprayed in Kashmir Community Board you noticed in the report that we need to the need to get the agencies together over those working around the red zone with the community a host road bridge we 've just got a bit of a discrepancy between the residents experience and the engineer 's report on that so we have to that 's why we 're having the on-site meeting and with the Aven site girls and Shirley boys zoning while the ministries come out with the interim zone the preference is still for certainty so it 's a little bit like what we 've been talking about over the South Sakhalin South New Brighton residents want certainty impermanence in a difficult situation so you could you could say really that that you know that lack of certainty isn 't confined to to one place people want to know post-quake with a stand and anything that 's basically I think for a mini over the so moved by Glenn sickened up by Erin I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that scary _"

    "text": "thank you in big spatula speaking is it a good thing or a bad thing right okay we 'll talk loudly right yes this is on page 5 of your thoughts where his winter gone but this morning we have got her and well it 's a report with lots of things that have gone on over the last month and a variety of issues but no pates in it so I want to bring up this morning and just highlight some things so far Wow heroic restoration Fokker Bravo Emperor Worf re working group and the aircraft service center so if we start with the WHA heroic restoration and the out peacock will resume it 's quite a challenging hitting there but this is an amazing project that goes back sometime it 's a partnership with the Department of Corrections to restore a carved waha Ryan now the waha rah is that that that up there that 's got to treat two things on the side of it and then over the stoppers as a plant that sort of provides a a roof to it but it 's an of a tuning point mm can 't agree whiter her means to celebrate the Millennium so there was one there but it was deteriorating and disrepair so this has been repaired over the last three or four years and it was rededicated on on the 26th of July but the important part about it was that it was done with the wrister with them with the with the prisoner who Department of Corrections who worked on this many thousands of hours to do it and who is very proud of his work that he 's done now that that is an entrance to a cultural garden and it contains plants of cultural value particularly medicinal plants and back in two thousand and two thousand when this was originally done the gardens itself there was nothing there so in 20 years though the gardens have absolutely flourished was planted by the community with land care assistance and angela has been involved throughout this long period of time so it 's great to see that come to fruition so the next one is the APA wolf no the aircar wolf features and can see there beautiful part and historic wolf and things but we have have a few issues around it that everybody wants to be honest at the same time and that we have also got commercial users recreational users and the public using it so there 's been an issue a few issues with with things on earth that shouldn 't be there so we 've been having a bit of a tidy up and there 's been fish crates and things that we 've been asked to remove from it and we 've also implementing some floats smoke-free signage and print in preparation for the cruise ship season historically tourists get off the boat and they light up immediately so we would just like to them encourage them to to walk across the horse safely and and not light up as soon as they get off it so we 're looking at also smoke-free signs around the other areas of the town as well so that was really triggered by a recent highlighting of it through your council process and we we looked at what we had in there is about Armistice Day the hundredth anniversary now this beautiful War Memorial is owned by the community it 's one of a few in New Zealand it 's managed by a particular committee a reserve a War Memorial Committee of dedicated people we have restored it and it cost about nine hundred thousand dollars to repair it following the earthquakes we found the funding ourselves and did that repair with the project manager and so Armistice Day is coming up on the 11th 11th and November and we they asked us for some funding and we have provided them with some funding and we 've also written and will write it with 1,000 or 1,500 and we are underwriting it for a further thousand dollars to have that particular ceremony but if you 're coming to ever I 'd have a look at it is the center of the town magnificent maintained beautifully to protect our garden standards it 's just an amazing setting in the town and this is a good story as well this is you know we listen to the radio at the moment and there was like hiding under the table this is one of those stories where we had a lot of trouble of getting this group over the line they were continually satisfied what was with what was going on and suddenly something happened and we found the right people for that team to work with and council and they now have got a sound working relationship between the Christchurch City Council and the community just how they should be happening each respecting each other and getting on with the job and they 've had a couple of working bees already it is an old cemetery there are 86 identified broken hip stones for appear in restoration not owned by families now because those families are well gone but it may cost about 30,000 to appear in headstone and they 're also planning for a memorial entrance and are going for council consent so that 's a good story a great story about it partnership that that as Sam has just gone so well from a disorganized I mean from a disgruntled group to something that 's positive and a good story to tell across susini and this is amazing story it 's we 're going to get our service center back for us so this is after the former anchor our post office that was built in 1914 and was and as a replacement of an earlier building ant building built in 1856 so it was it 's just a large domestic building but the interior still has original decorative plaster and moldings and plaster on the walls and it 's got a polished floor polished architraves windows and door frames so it is a magnificent tile building just alongside the wall more oil the warmer oils on the left over the other side of the road is the the museum and the the old bank building so it 's it 's the center of acara and we 're just so proud of that that area the service center moves back to it on tomorrow the third and the opening ceremony is on the 8th of August from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. so there are some reasons or not reasons businesses that will go into that building a crow district promotions I of might ask local civil defense team in a Corral might have some space here as well and new zealand proposed are just working through the proposal at the moment to go into the the right-hand side there that the no knots on the right house in the middle of the building but the colors look a bit different but they are based on the on the colors that the building was it was early on painted earlier on so it 's got a clock there in the middle up the steps there an old clock that has been nurtured and managed over the years and is back up and ticking away so we 're very pleased to have our service center opened again and it has some new moderns a great modern facilities and that hope I won 't dry about to drive I won 't have to drive to town council staff might not have to drive out to a car either they 'll just don 't link up and and meet with us as appropriate so that 's and the highlights that I 've just a few in this but I just love for community to hear the lovely stories that we do here at these mornings that come and we should be looking at how we can get our our community involved and some of these students that are going on I think it 's pretty much Pam so any questions Queen um thank you just over eight point three pens smoke-free I thought what a smoke-free and public places policy this already includes the precincts around our facilities yes that 's already there with relation to the the service center is and the museum what 's the wharf and the library I 'm sure we can work with smoke-free Canterbury and the other groups we work with to negotiate a voluntary approach to that we 've had a lot of success um along with the cycling actually we are recognized nationally for our extension over our smoke-free and public places policy in the way we 're going about it so if you would like us to set up some yeah we 'd love it would love that discussion the issue that we have got is you know what smoke-free actually means so we need to perhaps convey that in the appropriate communicate with the cruise lines so when you know cruise ship berths passengers receiver you know several announcements so there could be just part of you know the understanding where they come in into christchurch Littleton I thought that you know these policies exist okay thank you and thank you very much indeed I had one question sorry on six 623 it 's reported that one of the dictation asked that my last instructions on the wharf be removed I wasn 't quite clear from parents presentation but that is being done and I also just wanted to clarify that 's a decision that brought mate so whether that 's assistant counsel management Yanni I think that this was a recommendation that the board made and it was up to the council to implement it and it wasn 't the the one that I was referring to in my presentation here this morning this is a much larger issue that we have got with the M with the black catch and the users of process and the board has recommended that all of those structures that are not well those structures that are illegal that haven 't been consented be removed from the wharf we haven 't actually heard black from black cat how they received that information but that was the decision that was made and we need to work through that now okay so if we just clarify is that is it up to the community forward to take their sort of enforcement action or decision or is that something that council management should be doing that 's council we 're not doing it doing it council staff for addressing it so and accounts and stuff um it 's fun fighting for them enforcing it I 'm not aware of a time frame but it is it is being in full of I 'm aware that it 's being enforced all right very last question fell because we already know it so quickly you may well have been going to say this to Vicki but I just want to thank pan and the board especially for the support and your communities are quaintness and I 'm sorry we can 't come to the opening I think we 've got other meetings on p.m. but clearly your book and it 's just when you go to echo our it just it stands out so that 's it 's great work on the boards for half in the community thank you and so we moved turn my second dead end I 'll put the report those invoke listen I all right those opposed to carried and welcome to Eve _"

    "text": "and now we 'll move on to fin from one arrow here would seem welcome so you just reports on page 29 good morning well thank you again for the chance to present our update for the month now there 's just a couple of things I 'll touch on then I 'll hand over to Erin to talk through a couple of the slides on our presentation and then we thought would be really kind and give you a video to finish off today first of all you will see on page one of our report we 've obviously exercised our community board delegations we 've approved the two toilets at the rotor can hook at rotor reserve and Erin will talk about that shortly we 've put some no stopping restrictions and Elmore 's lane and we 've obviously looked at our discretionary response fund as well there 's just a couple of things to just note for your attention firstly the jelly Park recreational sport center that 's construction still underway all the redevelopment Lea and a follow up from our last meeting was that our staff request on that timeline so that 's all going to plan I was obviously got the Jeffery 's reserve replacement suction tank coming up shortly as well and I hope that said our meeting on the 20th of August they had alongside some work around the Glenn Dobie residents Association a request so we 're working through that as well we 've had quite a number of public forums come along and present to us which has been really good you 'll see under Section statuses been just a highlight of a couple of them that are there and you touch on the monarch butterfly stuff shortly which was quite interesting as I mentioned in our last meeting we had the community service awards as well about it two days before we presented last time again we 've just formally put that into the report for you it was a really fantastic occasion and we 've had really good feedback since so we 're really delighted with that I might pass no to Erin now to talk about the low key yeah thank you so the toilets so this is is what was the former Maori council land cup which is a lush area next to the jet ski lake about 18 months ago the issue still we 're around public I misbehaved here in a way there 's a little bit of anti-social behaviour and what have you this past summer it 's just kind of exploded in popularity on a really nice day because of the recreational value it 's a very quiet immunity value for the community with because it 's it 's a lake it 's fresh water the the the quality is absolutely superb it 's a very safe place for families to go and you know enjoy a little bit of water recreation and so this is and there 's a lot of other in clothes that they use that area the the recreational Reserve has now got proposed a toilets to be installed so it 's from about that a health aspect that the facilities he 'd be improved currently they 're just it 's just poor to lose little theater so there 's two sites there are about 700 meters of that they the staff are asking that the toilets be connected to the main services for electricity I mean there 's a lot of there 's a high cost for the Civil Works construction we 've asked the staff to go back and get through the numbers on those those estimates when they came to the site hopefully they 'll come back soon in the meantime with us that this coming spring and summer that adequate measures to be taking then consider action around toileting facilities and the recreation groups and that type of thing as best as possible yeah so one of the public forums I mentioned earlier was around monarch butterflies and you probably think what on earth is someone coming I want to talk about monarch butterflies about but we had Vicki still come along and present to us on a lot of work she 's doing in her own capacity around I guess their ability to can to maintain that population and some of our parts and what she 'd done is a bit of research around up and and literally going in the mornings and counting this quite a few issues particularly inside park around their ability to be sustainable and so we 've referred that part staff to work with her on but we just thought would bring it to your attention a really high level it was quite a fascinating one and in terms of rodents and that type of stuff but you 'll see on the left of that presentation up the there what these mutual sheep bandings that they 've tried at Everly Park and we 're hoping we can do the same at the inside so quite a cost-effective measure and to sort of mitigate something but it 's just one of those points I guess where we 've got someone actively involved in the community giving up their time to do it and it was kind of adding real value to to what we do so we wanted to bring it to your attention so Erin will finish off by talking about the group of the month and then we can take questions Chinese church it was formed in 1989 with about 25 in the congregation since then though they 's road and brunoise so it 's opposite jerry Bromley 's electorate office yeah the physical location of the of the church is actually in doing work Ward now find the representation review however most of the congregation do come from and the organization played a significant role in the aftermath of the 2011 earthquake they took on responsibility of looking after many of the families of the victims and the CTV building who came from overseas they provided accommodation food and support the police also held daily briefings with the families at the church the photo on the right is actually a displaced Boulder from the port hills which local council staff and sira staff organized to be delivered to the church it 's now placed on the corner of the site and as a memorial for the victims of the earthquake and just boy there 's also a time capsule buried and that 's due to be lifted I guess it 's called I think it 's October 20 39 the church provides a variety of activities and programs not just to the Chinese community people of the 's a weekly older adults education program with about 60 people attending each week there 's those angels ages volumes from 15 to 19 years old and there 's also a Christmas and a car park which is a delivery of goodie bags at Christmastime to the local community that 's coming up in a video next the there 's a variety of youth activities tuition and peer support this is a Friday night youth program leadership program basic basketball group and a high school youth group a new project that are starting in this past year is targeted at young people who don 't have an interest in sport or recreation but are keen on computers and art so they 're creating yeah running at the rate of media group [Music] Christmas on the car park this year was great we 've done it a few years and

thank you very much to the staff for coming along it was a excellency minute the the tech way for a fulfil our board was I guess around the successful objection to the application of an off license at record street the last year so now the community members that other areas of the city around helping support other members of the community around there so my takeaway from the vicinity last night was probably for goods to stay with them that 204 section 204 and speak Tov the legislation and support the community and instead of submitting evidence Oh instead of bringing evidence just making a submission in support of the community keeps things relatively dry and then you support the other communities the members of the community they are objecting to the to the solution okay thank you very much indeed very full report and it just out of time now so thank you very much indeed um Aaron 's going to move it and refs going to see conduct yeah I put that we received report those in favor

    "text": "and right we 're going to go on to why Cora Jake was a little scared to come what 's the only thing speed to come she have a CDHP meeting on agenda and making road for me and so I 'm happy to take most of the report is read and just highlight obviously the part as well as a couple of other smaller things so the part a was regarding the tea kiosk and Integra part there were four there were four proposals for for the use of us three were deemed non camera three were deemed commercial and one was was classified as non commercial we put a note on this to go to you guys that basically said we wanted some greater clarity from staff around what is a commercial and what is non commercial because we felt there was one proposal from the existing tier that could have some more then does have some non-commercial benefit and we just kind of wanted to be able to compare apples with apples and get some clarity about about how those two things are defined and the other to cap to the community board in the district licensing committee for a lawyer to appear on their behalf around the 375 fury road liquor store so we 're still just waiting to hear a little bit more about this as well as that I wanted also to mention the Rose trip Rose Chapel Historic Trust so that 's going out sorry I 'm having trouble find the notes that 's been less advertised soon anyway for therefore the use of their building and I think you can book at their age yeah sorry I said what are you oh okay um okay well that 's that 's my report here thank you very much indeed Jake are there any questions from anyone here not a question but it 's gonna point out just on the oh just on the screen behind the keys here um it was we had the opening of the revenue share graphics like way over the holidays as well and I 've got to say that once those deaf Adele bubbles are out it 's going to I mean people are loving it already there 's really high amenity it 's safe and once that whole route is completed that I would think that would be uh news winner yeah yes next year century I think I went for a bike spike right down it 's pretty cool right yeah it 's not quite as beautiful with the one I reckon but it 's actually stunning it 's really stunning yeah yeah Pauline can I just add to that too that it 's actually then idea to run the cycle wave down is immediately between the trees actually came in the but later on and it was a really good idea but the tricky thing is to do that without damaging the roots so the whole way that they 've done there has been fair test and salmon rights 3,600 square metres of the poorest papers that kind of another hundred fifty new trees with a currently being planted innovation almost as well so I think it is arguably most feared on the section but that some that 's really special to you that 's a wonderful so they really are starting to to keep as I see it the only everyone that 's open is going to make it more easy for everyone to see what an incredible version this is for the city once we get the fissioning connected cycle a race finished it 's one project it 's an incredible visionary project a name that 's just going to be wonderful but it little by little it 's starting to appear and as as seriously Christchurch 's been quite well respected around the country for heading this vision and people looking to us and we 're very lucky that we 've we 're at at starting gauges we are because we 're able to really see it in CTA funding which can be up to 50% sometimes more and it 's a huge help so we were actually ready to go with all those announcements came out and with the so you know watch it just wouldn 't give to other things to other things I just want to really quickly point out as we had our community service awards as well which were a lot of fun and also there was so that information is valuable Jake can I just pick you up on the liquor licensing thing does that mean that community boards can now appear at liquor licensing hearings not to my understanding no not okay okay but you can 't have a legal representation I think they 've been giving delegations so sorry thanks Vicky Jake I was gonna ask you a similar question but when the board go to the Imperial Authority I as the board looking at making a submission or actually supplying evidence to lose that Kay that 's come up as being a really a crappy part to have the proceeds of the arroyo engaged because I understand that when explosives hips on I can comment so the hearings the chair of the hearings panel at that previous hearing gay believes for the community board to actually engage and provide evidences it wasn 't expected that they would do it beforehand but that 's what happened and so there was a workshop yesterday on the roles responsibilities of Community Awards in this particular late these hearings so you get some clarification of that and council delegates to community boards around providing submissions as opposed to supporting other community Thank You Carlene and I 'm glad the points been raised because in fact I was at the workshop and it seemed to seem to me that there was a lack of clarity where some on the distinction between at the stage whether we can give evidence or make a submission so just raise even so declare okay I 've got cleanin attempt all right just just sorry apologize I couldn 't make the workshop but there 's a because your is a clear difference between making a submission and evidence because when you put an evidence you 've got to be prepared for cross-examination so I think when we get advice community water counselors or whatever it 's all about preparation if you 're going to step over that line from submission to evidence so I 'm not telling you how to suck eggs but I mean that 's a different thanks man you 're right thank you yeah Mickey can I just say something snows well [Laughter] yeah yeah it 's really clear that be heard at the initial district licensing hearing when it goes to are up for appeal the community board can also sick leave what we 've done in this case in terms of flops tellers actually sort leg with the council so we 're just having one representing both the community board in Carmel but it is kind of different I think we need to be really careful that the community board is not there as a party it 's there as a special what 's official recognition on behalf of the council the director or authority and it does need to be some clarity and some I think needed guidelines around just that process but it 's quite unclear in the legislation itself around things like deadlines for when information needs to be provided who you should provide the information when the key questions that came our community board at the initial district licensing hearing well shouldn 't we have legal representation and they lost some confusion over that so I think it would benefit from having some really clear guidelines around how community was cleared involved and hopefully there 's a good start and was progressing some really clear guidelines okay wait okay thank you thanks for that I 'll put the motion to receive the Community Board report and then if you want to we 'll deal with the TT asked as well as everybody okay with it since it 's all okay so I 'll just put the sorry I have a move forgive me those things Dion moves in ceará seconds I 'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed to carried and would you like _"

    "text": "so now moving on to item 48 the community resilience partnership fund item 48 okay we 'll take the reporters read but of the comments the staff wanted to make on this before we move to questions Thank You mr. chair I 'm just very briefly to help set the scene for you the purpose of this report coming back from the last time we were here in front of you is just to sharpen up the focus a little bit more for you in terms of what the program is doing and how the program contributes to meeting the housing first goals and what it seeks to do a particular round housing first fifth principle around ensuring those of a homeless save opportunities to build social connections and participate in local community initiatives so we would put a piece of council business as we 're in the community development space for this council for the last 20 years or so more possibly war council back will probably remind me Peter in terms of its work of grant Community Development and the internet space secondly the paper also just teases agencies involved so the Methodist mission is that as a leader and the holder of the funds in notes the support that the likes of Tafari Roy matter can bring them to the party as well in terms of the likely role I guess the final point I would like to make to you mr. chair is I guess an issue for council around our credibility and reputation in this whole space of addressing and homelessness so we would submit that a contribution of some form would need to be made particularly for our credibility if we are to continue to cheer the governance group of the housing first program in the Christ Church so just would like to point those things out so the staff recommendation recommends a figure of 200,000 now I 'm aware of you know so figures larger than that that have been considered previously and I 'm also aware of some consideration of whether the same could be achieved with a figure smaller than that so I 'd be interested in the thinking behind that figure of 200000 that appears in the report in the like to carry out the community connections program to its fullest to fit it was the Sun so that 's it we 've come up with this some here we note secretly some external funding sources that could be made but largely they don 't fund council or central government programs and the best would do would be to work with other organizations so the report we 're putting in front of you is to carry out this initiative to its fullest defeat so you may wish to discuss and debate amongst yourselves how far along that continuum you wish to support such program so the more funds that are put in the more is able to be done is that correct yes in terms of this figure of 200,000 per year so that 's it 's the estimated figure to carry out such a program tools for staff EEP to get the maximum benefit to support Lea has improves partnership particularly around us and for the principal here thank you Sarah this I mean the reason that the the report was actually sent back the last time wasn 't program itself I think we were all pretty convinced that it 's a worthwhile program it says that we had a Council resolution which asked for other funding sources to be found and it wasn 't_''_236.35 in the initial report which is why we asked for that the information to come early so it 's clear from that there are other funders available who would be willing to help fund once this is up and running and so because it 's what the the information that you 've provided to our C 's so I 'm just wondering if what we were able to do is so for example do number three and then it 's yes part of the actually request that staff or the what may be appropriate people within the housing through this program applies to those other folders for ongoing support sorry Becky back in case are you talking number three and two-story community yes so maybe before number four because number four sort of assumes that we 're not going to apply for other funding and we 're just going to working well we 'll we had sort of I guess two times ago that this came was very clear that we wanted other funding applied for if it was possible and it 's clearly possible and it might be that if they don 't fund it in a new application is made to this fund for an additional two hundred thousand it wouldn 't be difficult to do well certainly we we have we have had low level discussions about how we might have no process this and we could continue I think it 's probably a good idea if we continue to offer that level of support to the wider collective group but I think we really need this initial amount of funding whatever amount you decide because one of the main learnings about people as you know who get housed is that once they get has they need to be connected back to the community so we really need to get that established that seemed to me from talking to these various our funding agencies that there will be funds and they will be positive in the future like even in this gets up and starts running so years certainly and I think staff and team to do that we intend to continue those discussions so I 'd like to suggest that that we that we put something in there specifically about continuing the work with other funders because I think that 's really important that we don 't assume that we 're just going to keep doing this ourselves we know that Amos teens got an extra sixty five million dollars for this type of approach and as they 're developing how that 's going to work and it sounds like there are interesting other funders are interested as well I have to say that council 's work would be in partnership with the collective very much involved in the housing first model it wouldn 't be council separate from those people we 'd be working together people is that the agencies that are liable likely to be funded not us yeah so the other one is so how do we want how did you want to pick that up Sarah just wanted you know know that there is an expectation housing first program and other funders request that staff work with accessing agencies other funding for the program 's agencies or it would be in addition to ours maybe even make the program go much further so the wording that we 've got in this new item for request the staff work with the collective to continue to secure funding from other providers yeah to continue investigating yeah continues to investigate securing fondant yeah yeah I mean we don 't want to just do the investigation we want to actually apply for them if they 're available so with the Rican Beast insecure insecure yeah yeah absolutely I 'm not saying instead of for their food steal span yeah yeah yeah three still here which is the 200,000 for this year yeah and I had another question around number what 's number five now I 'm in the subject to the return of a satisfactory monitoring report I mean who has the delegation to decide whether it 's satisfactory or not and if we did secure other funding I 'm said to 200,000 we 'll get the most out of source and there was a satisfactory monitoring a report at this point we would still give an extra two hundred thousand which wouldn 't be needed so and we ever just say yeah up to or maybe it just comes back for new decisions so where is the monitoring report intended to come to who will decide whether the monitoring report is satisfactory or not they seem quite straightforward to come to Council through this fund so it 'd be quite good to just just bring it back to us again was it their intention that the monitoring report would come to council so that council could decide that it was satisfactory yes we 'd be looking to secure get that information working with MSD in terms of the monitoring of the program as well so then where would that report come to once it arrived in this building we would imagine the Social Committee in the first instance but then through to Council okay so subject to the ribbon so to capture this then subject to the return of a monitoring report to the satisfaction of council the council just in case we don 't_''_607.94 I thought what we were trying to reflect though was that if there was funding able to be granted from elsewhere that we reduced the 200,000 by that amount on assuming that having made changes Sera 's then going to move this with the changes and then there will be the opportunity for other questions did you see the other questions might have it might bring out some answers around standing order do you have a point of order on was your point of order on what was the point of order okay I 'm not allowing the point of order anyway continue with the questions and if I 'm assuming that you 'll move this with the changes yeah and then we 'll get a seconder for it then we 'll continue with more questions and if people want to move amendments or when we get into debate signal that they 're intending voting against parts of this or moving amendments to change parts of it then that 's how we 'll proceed so my last question is to do with the one sorry Jeannie what 's what 's left in the fund so there 's we don 't have anything in the report which sees what 's left for allocation to other so the current balances it 's even July was two million two hundred fifty five thousand dollars so Sarah did you want to make some changes to close five and so yeah yeah all right so you 're wanting to move what we 've got here that 's obviously amended as a result of your questions yep all right so Mike you were second there all right great now let 's continue with questions so felt my question we realized that the wording and there is a partnership but I just want to check with with the staff around applying for other funds why we would support them as per the the additional recommendation there am i right that in fact it would be the collective who apply for the funding not City Council that 's not air-eye I just want to clarify that just so we 're all clear yes that was the point I was making previously maybe partnership group to make the funding so those agencies would be the ones making the funding application we 've just been working with you to make that try and make that happen thanks Judy Jimmy regarding to the paragraph 4.05 on page six I 'm not sure I mean fine also six to secure our future in the eastern part of the purchase and be informed as evidence I just want to know this bike thank you doctor thank you cap counselor chin we had a staff member in the community service group notes this and they cover important I 'm not sure if Mary wish to comment on that as a part of covering the report students just in the four point five three and the key points on the on the covering so this was was this in the earlier report he talked about sorry I know nothing about this project overall also I won 't build objects of the fund Miri the wider objects of the resilience partnership what has this what is this relevance to this application but it 's the wider purpose of the resilience question one of the purposes of rasili community resilience partnership fund that was set up and it 's not just a council funder his 'n our central government Ministry of Health funding in here as well the resilience program after the earthquakes so that 's just one of the principles of the wider found not about this project criteria those are the criteria and what you prioritize they 're not the criteria that the application has to meet thank you this is still questions are they Jonnie so just wanted to check can the community resilience fan be used for services that support individuals so what is this project doing because I thought it was going around working with the individuals well yeah I suppose that operational level is working at individuals but it is working with it within the homeless community to support and get on track and mezu sound the report to build social connections and to feel grounded in their communities better about participating activities and those things so in other ways the point of difference that council can make to this program so with the assessment that 's that 's the same as the previous support that was in front of you so yeah I 'm just like so I can 't see why the fun wouldn 't be able to help services to support individuals can I just say that it 's not about providing specific social work interventions to individuals it 's about about providing a wider community network sure so a so that we are a peer worker employed yeah and they will go around and visit individuals and connect them to different things services working with other staff and they 'll be working with programs that are already provided at Tafari of ruamata and various other agencies and then working the individuals will already have been suitable for or want to participate in various programs so they 'll be networking and navigating and working generally around and they 'll be looking for what extra programs need to be set up and that sort of it 's just and I 'm just trying to understand but the advice that we 've had over the street worker outreach program it 's basically saying that existing role which provided provide services and support to individuals which seems to be almost identical to what the services and I just you know like I 'm happy to support this but I wondered if we needed to change the criteria or at least have some consistency so that other projects that we might like to consider funding can be can be considered I don 't think the one that we 've just considered to fund for these the people in the city so it 's got a different criteria no no I understand that but it 's because it 's not eligible for this funding it 's wrong but I had hope that we could reduce this amount by the amount that so I will foreshadow an amendment to reduce the amount by the amount that was granted to that fund so I was just trying to understand because one of the things that I would like to consider is that this funding should be taken out of the endowment fund rather than the craft fund but I don 't know you know if the criteria doesn 't street with outrage but it fits this it seems very inconsistent way of applying funding for what as I perceive it are three quite similar initiatives working with communities of individuals within a certain sector to try and find some positive solutions and that 's what I 'm struggling with because I just can 't see how we 're consistently applying the criteria this application the difference between the phone so the community resilience fund as is about building social capital and social connections between people and communities in the in strengthening a community so as a community they can respond to situations and thrive and develop relationships that 's about building a sense of community within a community the their differs from what is a social work intervention which is why the other one went to Kaplan down at fund where social work intervention works with an intervention with an individual and ensures they get the right social work service whether it 's drug and alcohol work with it budgeting work whether it 's an individual program that actually works with the individual so the individual is resilient rather the difference between a social work intervention and what the community resilience Pampers trying to achieve either on the side of Capitol endowment fund are we able to do that I think we would need a report on there but you know to be honest I mean I I don 't know how much is sitting in that fund I haven 't_''_1276.61 had any analysis of it hey I think we heard previously that 1.5 yeah I mean we could we could do fear this one I don 't really want to defer any more because it 's been deferred so much but but I just yeah and the other question I had was in terms of night ah hey I think I proved it you asked have they been tipping in a cool career have they been approached for funding for this given that the research that we 've had has shown that there 's I think 70% of of the people are Maori highlight no Tahoe because don 't come from the South Island well I understand that but they sit on the growth we 've had advice 're involved in the group we should consider funding and I just I 've been given I just thought why wouldn 't we approach other other people on their group I know that we always seem to be going to for joining and we never seem to get in this makes a grant of 200,000 but Andrew thank you um so an amendment has been signaled that would have the effect of reducing this from 200 to 130,000 what would the effect of that be if we were to fund at the lower level what would the effect of that way on what the program was able to deliver and its outcomes sure be a little bit difficult to quantify the I guess the numbers of of people reached or anything like that but certainly the program would be able to start and would still be able to start in a meaningful way at this point in time so when the report last came to council I asked probably the same question or a very sim question and I was advised that regardless of the amount of funding 50 people now changed is that correct no no big department council I know that it 's a minimum of 50 people per year through the program so this initiative would still seek to work with as many them as possible two hundred thousand was as we said to deliver it to its forced effect whoever if council was of a mind to reduce the funding then we would anticipate with discussions that we 've been having say it 's a meaningful work and nevertheless be started and commune stand carried out so isn 't the number of people that can be held directly proportional to the amount of funding that we put in not in terms of being housed but in terms of being further supported from there for this initiative here thank you so MSD is totally committed to the funding the housing part of the 50 people and maybe more depending on how it develops this year this is just in terms of the community connectedness capacity development work that 's supporting the ability to stay in the houses so fill in then glean I 'm but worried about can I just ask you like around the community connections program there 's an amount of funding to be attached to it from us as you 've indicated that 's a the request could I just wonder if you could perhaps describe for us about the the challenges of actually operating that program with the people who who these workers will be working with like you 'll have been here before when we had descriptions around the difficulties for the people who are begging clearly these people under different categories so I just wonder if you might just comment on some of the challenges that would be involved in terms of the for the people who would be receiving this funding I think it 's very clear that the work that we 're talking about here is quite long-term work it takes a long time to work with people who 've been outside our community for a long period of time and there has been a report produced to inform housing first through a Comcare project around the last eight months called Christchurch Street homelessness 2018 a grassroots expert exploration in our streets 28 people over that period of time and gave specific help to about 18 if you read that report and we are happy to circulate it to everyone I think it 's incredibly informative about what sort of work works with people who have been locked outside of our community so to speak for a lengthy period of time it really takes working alongside these people and getting to know them making them re-- trust our society navigating them back into a frame of mind where they themselves can find it acceptable that housing will be provided for them and that they can get back into community connections like we all probably take for granted who live in houses already so it 's the point of difference I think is it 's the work that works the evidence shows is very long-term capacity building work that takes a long time so the more the two that 200,000 for this is based around a discussion of how this program could be most effective once the people are housed and certainly talking to the people at the Methodist mission this has already all been confirmed so we 're happy to circulate that report I think it would be a fantastic reading for people and we will do that but it certainly explains what I 'm trying to say there in the report you think you in the report this has been account of the numbers who were merely estimated my understanding is that count was quite some time ago months ago and I understand other the agencies really are updating their could you just pips let us know where that 's at in terms of the estimates the current estimates please you need so that yes so yes an answer to that question the initial assessment of the numbers you need to understand that it 's very difficult knowing the numbers of homeless a lot of homeless people are hidden particularly woman who are homeless in the research that was a sponsor that was carried out through calm care that I 've just referred to when agencies were asked and this research work with all the major agencies in Christchurch ed the NGO agencies staff there said they thought was actually going on the interesting points they also made was that they feel that most of the homeless and do not are not on the streets in the inner city many are in the suburbs they also made some interesting comments about the makeup of those people in terms of quite a point of difference what between what they saw in what the initial assessment we have in their report so it 's very difficult to make those estimates so and MS me I suppose the second point if I may age that as a mysterious cussing with local authorities and housing first programs around the country a clear and consistent methodology for under undertaken counts of the homeless ie rough sleepers so they 're contemplating point in time or list type approaches so that was currently underway so um okay well there are a couple of amendments that I would like to make to the resolution one of them is to reduce the the number and three to a hundred and thirty thousand just meanwhile back in the kitchen somebody 's been making up a resolution and and the the the other initiative the outreach worker that was funded was for a slightly different purpose but it is a connected purpose in terms of the streets of Christchurch and I think that residents would be somewhat surprised that it was an add-on rather than an inclusive some in terms of the item five I can see what has been attempted here but I 'm actually thinking myself that this is that that this is making a a grant when I don 't think we should create an expectation I think we should we should ask for a report back to Council to consider a grant for the four-year to of the Community Connections program after it has been in place for whatever period of time so and it could be considered as part of the annual plan I just I really think that it 's important that we keep the community resilience partnership fund I 'm actually gonna agree with something that yani said and then as I know I know it taken further and that is that I think sometimes that it would be better to look where we where we source the resources from in order to support what is a wider community responsibility I 'm all for us working in a collaborative fashion with the other agencies but you know there there will be people who sort of kind of put up their hands and say that say that it 's not a council responsibility it 's to me it 's a shared responsibility across the city so which is why I 'm not objecting to making a supportive first team so this is not a foreshadowed motion this is an amendment that I 'm moving to the whilst for it to be Ansel it might not be clear well it says makes a grant of you know subjects to the satisfaction of council so the yeah when we had when you went in the room and we had our discussion I can see it but it makes a decision as it comes from the community resilience partnership fund you know so alright it doesn 't show us the option of considering another source yeah that 's true yeah I 'm just moving in a I 'm so I 'm just there as we discuss this a lot in the earlier bottom that 's that 's fine and I I haven 't been here for all of it it 's but we 've been here for questions not for debate so the debate is yet to happen so I 'm haven 't missed the debate so would so we haven 't got number five right for me so I want to amend number five so there are two amendments that I want to make one us to change the grant size in item three and to change the wording of item five to say request report to Council and yeah you know leave it leave it as you 've returned our subjects the return of a monitoring report to the satisfaction request a report to Council seeking approval of a further grant all right so do I have a seconder for the amendment those amendments think we hearin all we said we 're happy to just take them without warrant but then we have to you don 't have to okay you can you can doesn 't matter but if if we do it the other way around now then somebody will have to move to put it back so right okay Phil and I just didn 't make a point of it the process Liam because I think a number of people may not be aware that in fact is that we received a memorandum from Paul and Jenny dated the 11th of July in response to some Christians that Sarah asked and it just seems to me that some people probably haven 't seen it it came it came I think yesterday and it was quite it 's very clear around that future funding options for housing first and possible partnerships and it just seemed to answer a lot of the concerns that have been raised by yarny and that I 'm you seem to be alluding to yourself lately in this foo the funding available from other people it does also explains the circumstances it 's not not funding council hello gents sorry you know I think apply it 's unfair that we 're not eligible for funding for her because of yeah so um so I 'm we 've got it moved and seconded we 've got the amendment moved and seconded so I 'm just going to open it up for debate and and then I 'll put the amendment and then I 'll put the motion fill this matter has come to Council several times going back to February actually and look I think I 'm Bruce Rendell is here and I want to thank Bruce but also the other staff for the huge amount of work that 's been done I want to go back to Bruce 's concept where about where um homelessness fits in the whole problem of housing in our city and there 's that whole continuum the Bruce is referred to and we 're talking about homelessness which is on the left the left hand side of that continuum in the middle we have social housing and affordable housing is also there to something which we as a council I guess struggle with in terms of that of the whole issue of housing in our city I I think unfortunately the people are homeless we know they 're and I guess we also know that this last winter has been brutally cold for people we know how cold it is and how hard is it to get up in the morning and we can only imagine what is like for the hundreds of homeless people who are not only near streets but also in your suburbs and are quite hidden is a staff have told us this part of the program is about the community connections part it is a part that m ust haven 't really fully addressed and I compliment the staff for picking picking this part up and just looking at how an effect the community resilience and partnership fund fits to a tee to address these issues where people are homeless still have their own communities they still have their own family or Farnell and they need to remain connected with their especially when they do opt to move into to a house or a home or a unit it has been indicated that it 's Celts as we represent a lot of people and we know that a lot 've heard that coming today it 's maybe more central governments but the fact is all of these people who are homeless on their streets and their suburbs they are from our local communities they are all New Zealanders they all grew up in Christchurch so so what I also want to say is that the the goal of of housing first is to end homelessness I would remind you that that is also part of our City Council 's housing policy and it goes Council will work with other agencies to address acute housing need and to eliminate homelessness not manager not tactless the sides just really to address it full-on and this is what this component of the program will do there 's this earlier get in the misty funding and being rehearsed we know though that if a person the person won 't succeed if they 're isolated from their street friends and I think in Christchurch we 're really fortunate that we 've got top housing agencies in the country really in our city and I committed to doing this work as a collective and they joined up now aircon air council have a really great opportunity to be part of that partnership we know that this program won 't address all of that continuum of housing which I referred to before but will at least increase the supply of houses for the people at the moment who have no houses who are homeless and that let 's apply would not otherwise have been available unless we work through this program I will also just say that it just seems to me that the people are homeless actually are men and women just like you and me if we 're considering these recommendations to and I would be extremely reluctant and I have seen to the mirror to it to agree to the reduction but we need to consider each and every one of us just we need to ask ourselves what if that homeless person who I 'm seeing on the street was my father or my mother or my sister or my brother so I can meet I really ask you to look at this to make sure that as a council we succeed we actually put in money where our mouth is around us rather than just kind of saying it should be someone else 's responsibility I know that no one else here really says that I 'm aware that there 's a lot of people who do have that view and I 'm asking asking us as a council to take a leadership role today and to actually go further than the amendment and as I have indicated it will be with a lot of reluctance that I would accept the amendment Aaron and then down I just want to address a couple of the points that were raised there one is around these people grow up in our neighborhoods a lot of them didn 't there 's a lot that have moved into Christchurch and there needs to be a bit more work done around who these people are and wired up to come here it strikes me is really odd that you would move to Christchurch post-disaster to be homeless and so some of those things need to be solved and we need more information around it and you on as well so let 's not be blind to completely blind to that but we should absolutely genuinely help anyone who wants help and wants to change their life and wants a hand up but not all of them do and they don 't necessarily want us to put them all in the same box because they are quite different as people and if it was my mother or my father or my brother living on the street I 'd take them home I 've got a house five people stay at my house all the time and I would take them home and so someone needs to point the finger at their families about taking them home as well sometimes dealing we are the city of opportunity where anything is possible open to new ideas new ways of doing and I 've lost the plot on the last bit the reason that I was I wanted to say that is them I just wanted to pull up one comment I just heard they 're the reason people come to cities is because it is a place of opportunity be selling ourselves as that and shouting from the rooftops and saying come to Christchurch look for those jobs look for those opportunities but if you fail the city 's not going to kick you out it 's going to support you that is the message that I want everybody in this country to know that Christchurch is their city and we 're not going to kick people out we 're not going to say I 'll look you don 't have a job you don 't have a house we 're not going to look after you can sit on the street and bloody big no that 's not the city I want us to live in I 'm sorry this is I 'm actually a little bit upset well I annoyed that out of the recommendation from the staff and then would just cut it down 70,000 these people are at the bottom they have been cut out from services have been lifted out to dry they have been I can 't_''_2546.09 say that word here but they 've just been left to rot and we 're just issue there actually we need to take some leadership on I know there needs to be some work around us to go look we need to sort this out from all of these other issues that have been mentioned there 's street based sex workers there 's the big in on the street and these people have homes but they 're big in on the street because there 's just poverty that they can 't afford and they 've got drug an issue it drug and alcohol issues all sorts of stuff but the genuine homelessness which is this is about to address these people need our support and they need it now there is housing first out there that 's going to address the 50 people each year to get those chronic homelessness but this is actually going to address a little bit more than those put those 50 people that have got chronic homeless issues there are people in our streets who are working with these people for nothing I know a couple of those people when they need to be brought into the tent here there are around this whole the way it 's working but we need to get it off the ground and actually then look at it and say how can we bring all of these street people with the street issues into one enter under the teams and actually work properly so I won 't be supporting the amendment I 'll be supporting the 200,000 because that 's what the staff recommended that 's what everything 's been based on moment and we just need to show some leadership and then address it and then look at it so I really implore everybody here to say look let 's just support the 200,000 bring that back to us and and you know what the other work that 's going on in six months or whatever it is time for the long term plan when we amend that and how can then we start working together and actually have a bit more of a collective approach around this because I do not want to see the people on the street suffering any longer we do these talks of money oh and there 's different government over two years for this project in the city we 're talking two hundred thousand that compares to a ratio in Auckland of three point seven million from government and 1.7 million from that council the cost-benefit ratio to me doesn 't stack up it goes way beyond it so for the price of half a house two hundred thousand dollars that will give rise to a yield of 50 houses this year in 50th and X so we we do cost-benefit all the time so I don 't think we can look past it so the price of half a house gives rise to 50 places shelter a basic human right this year in 50 in the next also wish to point out 200,000 is about one third the price of a park upgrade in the city this it 's interesting the whole debate over whose job it is it 's a bit like a custody battle here you take the baby no you take the baby well actually sorry this is a time for us to show leadership our reputation as a city sits on this are extend to us but by virtue of being is a country a signatory to the Universal Bill of Rights we need to ensure that we give the full money to this today and I take on board the deputy mayor 's question to Paul while it may not affect the actual quantum of houses provided it will have a diminishing effect on those wraparound services that follow that housing so I please urge you to support this fully to me this recovery means little if we 're going to push ahead with big fancy projects and not here for our people there is a chance that actually if we don 't attend to this and end homelessness by next year as originally said that by the time we built this Stadium visitors to the city are still going to see people languishing on the streets is that what we want in the housing policy it talks about as phil has said the actions we can take right across the spectrum of housing housing is a system it 's a bit like jingo if you take a piece out near the to do all that we can right across the spectrum if we 're going to have a good effective optimal housing outcomes for our community so I please ask you to support this as I said you can have all the flesh buildings you like in the city and no disrespect you can have all the flesh cycleways but if you can 't house your people to me in my mind it means diddly squat thank you okay then then Mike Jimi me reiterate what Darren was saying in the bit that he forgot at the end was that anything is possible in the city and from from my point of view it 's quite possible as a city that we can actually solve homelessness and I think that 's what we 're on about making sure that we have a socially inclusive city that includes everyone and that means that because we start with different resources in the community that we do things differently for various groups if you 're on the street and you 're not on a benefit it costs you one hundred and ten dollars to benefit that 's very difficult to get if you 're on the street with no benefit no source of money there are a lot of barriers that are put in your way if you stop and talk to a number of the homeless you 'll find all sorts of stories there is no one formula that leads to homelessness and there is no one type of person that is homeless in the city and you know from the work that you 've done that actually it can be quite a long process in making sure that they are securely housed and what will become their home so this has come before us a really lot of times and I would like us to go with the 200,000 I 'm fine about the amendment I would just prefer it was two hundred thousand for two years so they get on with it I met with housing first the other day I was hugely impressed by the staff that they had by the work that they 're doing they 're about to open the office soon so that people have a place if we 're going to be bold and ambitious as a city and we 've set the goal of ending ending homelessness that 's part of our housing policy it 's on the continuum we 've done a small part of it today in terms of the shared equity fund changing some slight things about there then that 's out in the marketplace at the moment so so we can actually help people at that end we know we want warm dry homes that helps people at 13 we know you need more social housing we know we need more affordable housing and right at this end the people who are actually in 4° living on he referred street or any other street written in Hagley Park in a number of locations that I could name there that we cannot walk away this fund is actually a joint fund with government so even if we do two hundred thousand a year only a hundred thousand is actually coming from the City Council so I think we 're actually I think we just have to get on and do this I we have to prove that as a city we do have some really bold goals and one of those is about all of us all of us because they are somebody brother and doesn 't matter whether they come from Christchurch or grew up here I don 't care it makes no odds they are living on our streets and that 's not OK in this city they are all they all have stories that are radically different and that need some compassionate understanding from the rest of the community to change this situation and I would expect if I was living on the streets that the City Council of Christchurch would actually be compassionate about that so I will be voting for the 200000 I would prefer it straight for two years but we have to go without a movement I 'm just gonna put myself on the speaking list because I think it 's important given the context as to explain why I 've asked for council to consider reducing the grant in the first year and to review where it comes from beyond that the community resilience that 's that 's that 's not the point the main point is that we 've already granted 70,000 to to a an outreach social social work outreach service which will be hosted by the Christchurch City mission for 12 months I can 't believe that that 's not a contribution to what we 're trying to achieve here and it was specifically acknowledging the increase of people street begging or sleeping rough and the central city and suburban surrounds with people with high and complex needs they 're all the people that we 've been talking about so all I 'm saying is that the money that we are allocating today from a responsible point of view we are contributing 200,000 if you agree to the hundred and thirty otherwise it is two hundred and seventy thousand dollars that has been contributed by the council to what is a shared problem and I agree I don 't_''_3139.079 I don 't think for one minute that it is acceptable that people are sleeping rough in our city I don 't believe for one minute that it is acceptable that people and I do agree with Aaron that there are many multi very complex issues that sit on behind us and it is not all as it seems for some but not others and I agree also with everything that she said about the nature of the people that are concerned and Leaside do stop and talk to people and I do understand that the the nature of circumstances you know for some people just a moment 's and a tension on a road can lead to a brain injury which can lead to the loss of a job the loss of their family the loss of their home the loss of everything and yes people do travel to big cities because there are opportunities there but I 'm I believe that the council 's you know with its financial constraint that it has at the moment I don 't think it 's unreasonable to say we 're making to two levels of contribution one level we 're paying half of the social out week Social Work outreach service which will really respond and I want to acknowledge and Galloway and know this you know stronger christchurch group safer christchurch sorry i keep getting mixed up with all the groups but it has brought together representatives from central city business city mission drug arm we can uncomely s-- Durham Street parish mental health resources and Education Center you know see I mean it 's brought together all of these things we 're working in collaboration and partnership and I don 't_''_3249.99 I don 't think that it 's right that we just sit here and and and and make that that longer-term commitment or there higher level of commitment you know I just think we 've responded in a matter of agency to the way that our community has asked us to respond with the outreach service it 's the same organization I believe they 're going to be working in partnership I just you know so that 's that 's why I 've moved the amendment I don 't want anyone to think that I don 't care about the people that are sleeping rough on our city I do care very much Mike and then Jimmy and then Andrew issue in our city and the number of people who live in this situation for a city of our sizes is not good enough and society is measured by how it treats its most vulnerable and I support counsels position in this partnership approach this has actually been a really good and passionate debate and and I will actually be supporting the amendments Council recently we just thought the strategic framework T on he mentioned earlier highlight all the vision but I would like to review our committee outcome particularly in here are for the community outcomes the first one strong communities here particularly find quite clearly strong sense of community active participation in civic life and a safe in a healthy community these three you know this quite wavy crucial for us but as a councillor how do we can make the is enough to me but a least give us that this kind of well intention would like to achieve this community the outcome especially our city is still in the final stage of the earthquake recovery we mention is a regeneration but I to hope it 's of transformation we still have popular no way to go how do we to working together I think of this very important especially we see that the paragraph four point of one here for this all crucial that the pointer you know looks like this the candle after the party fully comply with the councilor community outcomes so it 's difficult for me you know to reduce the staff original the accommodation so I think this especially for point two we can see here purpose this one for support project strengthen community by increasing community participation connectivist in the resilience and intention objective forty compound with alchemy outcome so that I 'm reluctant to support mainland I would like to keep the original way enjoy thank you I talked earlier about my disappointment every time when I see people sleeping on the street on Herefords Street Colombo Street elsewhere in City and there is certainly a safety perception around there and there may be a reality of safety not necessarily for the people that see the perception but maybe even for the people sleeping on the street this is happening of view this afternoon it 's happening here in Christchurch and it shouldn 't think so that 's been well canvassed in the debate already I was particularly interested in the answers to the questions that I asked given the answers to similar questions the last time this came in front of Council and the last time I was led to believe that the outcome would be the same regardless of the amount that we put in today it becomes clear that the amount of work we do is directly proportional to the amount of money we put in and the earlier questions around how staff had arrived at two hundred thousand in their recommendation I think those answers were particularly relevant as well so I mean whilst I realized that we wouldn 't want to spend any more on any initiative of them we need two equally we need to spend what we need to to get the best outcome from work that we 're doing we we shouldn 't be doing things half-heartedly we should be wanting the best that we possibly can get from everything that we answers to the questions that 200,000 is the correct amount I certainly understand the motivation for you know looking at ways that we can deliver something meaningful for less than that but given the answers to the question I 'm certainly very much on the page of the 200,000 and I will be supporting that and therefore not supporting the amendments I also found the wording that Dion was was struggling to find when he was speaking earlier so counsels vision City Christchurch is a city of opportunity open to new ideas new people and new ways of doing things the city where anything is possible the two words that were missing councils vision Christchurch is a city of opportunity for all I can 't support the amendment to reduce the money either I think that I understand completely that we have families who are really struggling to stay in their own homes in to see us spending money on those who some people think don 't deserve our support is probably quite difficult however I think the question is not about well what we spend or the amount that I think that my experience recently of of supporting somebody into a house is that you can a huge amount of time money resource can be put into getting somebody into a home for them only to stay for a very short time because they do not have the support that they need to stay there many of the people that are on the street do have homes so why are they not there they 're not there because they have a multitude of needs that have to be addressed to help them stay in those home so for me this is you know income can be bought right down to a financial question what is the best use of resource here and I think by putting this 200,000 into this program we are actually going to make the best use of the resource that we already have which is I think prudent and good stewardship so I will be supporting the original recommendation for two hundred thousand for this program yeah okay okay Jonnie and then Pauline is that it cuz then I 'll come to Sarah to wrap off I mean I think you know as people have said this this is a city issue and we can choose to ignore it we can choose to address it and you know I 'd like to be on the side that chooses to address this but we also have to talk to central government there are reasons why Christchurch has a higher prevalence of some of these issues than other cities and other communities in New Zealand and some of that is largely contingent on central government 's approach to see in Christchurch as as a soft-touch where they can not fund mental health services properly they can not fund our social housing adequately and we will just continuously pick up the pieces the thing I love about Christchurch is that traditionally it 's been a city that has always had a very strong social conscience and it 's also being a city that believes and that everyone should have an equality of opportunity but also of life it 's the thing that means that people here can have a pretty reasonable quality of life there is a lot around New Zealand just to put this into context I do struggle to understand how some of the people that are criticizing you know those of us that are questioning the use of this money can just put it in a context we give DC 's rates funded DC 's to a number of organisations in our central city and I certainly are concerned and I won 't support the amendment I 've actually I was initially going to support it but I 've heard from some of the people that have been doing the work some of the counters who I know have been putting a lot of effort into it and I 've taken over what I 've said around the impact of us needing to do something and the impact on these individuals but to put this in the context then the amendment and even the full amount is less than the Wrights funding we give to Christ 's College wear a uniform cost 1,700 for a student it 's unbelievable it 's unbelievable that we give tens of millions of dollars to some of the wealthiest debate about two hundred thousand dollars to address homelessness so I 'm gonna support this not the amendment I think we need to start really working together with groups I don 't quite understand why post-earthquake and possibly a little bit before the earthquake the idea of collaboration seems to consist of us having to fund everything and many other people coming on board there are other organizations and groups and charities in this city who are very wealthy who are making huge amounts of money from what 's going on and I don 't see their contributions to some of these issues and I don 't believe it 's fair for council to continuously have to pick up all of the pieces I 'll leave you with one final thought and that is if we really want to end homelessness then we need to ensure that we have housing we currently do not have enough money to fix our social housing we 're cutting the number by 500 in our long term plan and we are woefully inadequate ly spending to repair some of our units if we want housing and I firmly believe that hopefully today could be a turning point where we say this is an important issue and it 's not just about providing services although that 's important it is also equally as important that we start to consider how we fund the repair and the increase in social housing that we own in this city because I that equally as important as the services that go around including fully supports these projects both of them but I think the issue here is that whether we look at these as two separate ones or whether the one before the 70,000 support workers is ripped into this now we know I 've gone through my reading I read them as two separate projects and that is the way I 'm looking at it now I don 't want to wreck the first one into this one because I think it 's going to weaken it and they 're both partnership funds so it means that we 're not really footing the whole bill which is great these ones a partnership with the city mission this one far as I just want to address Aaron 's question because well his comments about if you saw you know your mother or your father or your brother and was homeless you 'd take them home there 's not easy and there 's no single fixed no matter how big your heart is or have the queue waters we need help serious help for a serious issue and that 's why I want to see these as two separate projects they also want to community and for the work you 've done and let 's get on to this in lefty our city uplift you have people up and really look at this as a resilience project I will be zero thank you um no these are the I mean this is an incredibly valuable program there 's no doubt about that and it 's my been happy to to move the original motion and I hear bits that you no doubt they you 've run around the table supports the program in in the previous one themselves I can 't psychotic completely doubts that but I think you 've matter where people grow up they 're all human beings they 're all you know part of the city now and this funding doesn 't get people off the street this is for the wraparound services the additional wraparound services on top of the ones that you misty will already be funding and while councillor Turner pointed out their staff had said yes with more money you do more work staff also were very very clear that the one hundred and thirty thousand dollars would provide a very meaningful start to this program in the advice that we heard just before and this allows for more funding to be applied for for from other organizations that we 've put in one of the resolutions and doesn 't preclude a further replication if needed this isn 't our money this is rate payers money and we are bound to be prudent with it and which is why I 'll be supporting the amendment in counselor cot oh yeah I mean councillor cutter is right they there are two separate projects that we 've looking at funding today but there has been councillor Galloway who have talked about those people on the street but who have homes and who are really struggling because they have complex problems that 's not what this fund is for that 's the one we 've just funded from the 70,000 from the capital endowment fund and we 've put 70,000 towards that particular work but that 's not what 's funded for this this is for people who don 't have homes who are going to be going into homes and have those complex projects which is why I think the mirror is completely right in the fact that they are linked and that 200,000 is a is that a completely appropriate first but but we 've done it through two different funds because it 's a very complex program there are other people working in the space already and and our contribution isn 't the end of the work that we do on us it 's just a start so I 'm happy with amendments um clearly the the dollars and cents isn 't going to pass by way of amendment but I will put we can we deal with the amendment Clause five separately from the amendment to Clause 3 because I really don 't want to I mean if I would just do that and then if it doesn 't pass then we 're stuck with the community resilience partnership phone but I really do want us to look at something else but but but but you know I mean it 's agnostic at this point so I 'll move oh sorry I 'll put the amendment to Clause 3 so sorry um all those in favor say aye those opposed say no there is lost and item 5 I 'll put the amendment all those in favor say aye those opposed say no well okay so those in favor put up your hand one two three four five six seven so so this so that so how many are left yeah those against one two three four five six did I count myself a verse say I I mean put up your head I understand me I I see that I was going to put it as two separate immense so so now put the complete motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "so now moving to item 29 so Vicki you 're happy to move this alright so and you 're having a second yeah so Vicki 's moving any seconding so a greatly agreed use of the decision to enter may 2018 to use our zoning so this is moved so Vicki you 're moving this is an amended version right okay so the steps are the staff recommendation has changed agree that due to the decision or 10th on May that council will waive of the process of any character right okay that 's fine so Vicki you 're happy with that and you 're happy with that okay so this has been moved and seconded I didn 't check with anybody had any questions in response you would have seen from the report by the business community social service agencies health agencies and counselors so county and councillors lead this initiative and saw that it needed to be a multi-agency approach and that council the council leading it cancer Galloway clean water swigs and others saw that county council could make a contribution along with the police social service as council small contribution to what was a city problem and help give hope their activation of the central city you make it a safer place for citizens to be it also assists people that are living rough and down-on-their-luck_:_144.53 so it 's a small contribution compared to the other partners thank you so still in questions deal just given this as quite maybe a little bit different than what we 've done things of how sorry I 'll start again given that this is kind of different to how we 've done things before do you think it would be prudent to have say a review of how it 's working so in like eight months or ten months or something like that before because obviously this is only a twelve month a 12 month contribution do you think we should maybe have a review and actually say is this working given that there 's the next item that 's coming up as well we 'll have a review of how that 's going to work and then there 's some other outreach things that are happening within the want to sort of maybe you know I 'm happy with how things are at the moment but I do want to see maybe if we could do it better down the track once we see how these things work that we actually can tie that into a review process so my understanding is that multi-agency group are going to continue to meet lead by councillor Galloway and that the road team will be monitoring what 's happening and looking at other initiatives that might need to complement this so I assume that multi-agency so do you think there may be something that could should come back to us at some stage around this just to give confidence to the risk should we put it into a resolution or something like that just to give confidence to us that you know this is going to come back and we as a collectively collective whole along the lines have asked the interagency forum to review progress and report back to Council within 12 months yeah something like that yeah before before it gets to the end of this 12-month period definitely we 're looking to give all right so yeah or request the interagency forum review progress report back to Council on the focus in their achievements if so that it can be considered before the end of the period that we 're looking at here that 's effectively what I 'm trying to achieve because you know things may change in the space and their time and we want to make sure that we 're doing what 's right for the city and for the people that were trying to help so let 's just get some wording up here and then I 'm going to need to check with the mover and seconder they 're happy with it so request that the request of the interagency forum report back to the council on the progress and achievements within eight months eight months from now yes of course it does yep well do we want to say earlier than this do we want to say soon I don 't know if we said within six months it 's a little bit longer yep that 's fine so just checking then screen Viki you 're comfortable with that and yeah great okay so coming back to questions I 've got Pauline Phil and Sarah could be there could be if T will be up yeah just to lose I mean that 's operational but it allows for that flexibility yep that 's fine Phil Thank You Miri this for the outreach worker like as part of the safer City group they 've been very good minutes gone back to all the participants and it just seems and I 'm in support of our four I think account it 's good to have full accountability but I just I 'm shaking with Uri that so far with those minutes I 'm assuming that you 'll have seen then being a good record of the for the accountability object group just making sure to make sure that you continue to see by will minutes okay that 's great thank you sailing the terms of respect anyway yeah so whether it rather coming straight to Council with it maybe it just goes to the committee and then if there 's any further work or Council but I mean I think that probably sits really well in there in the committee well it sounds like it will be reported into Council via the committee 's melody anyway yeah if there was anything I 'm thinking was if there was issue around timing with wanting the report to come as late as possible but not so late that it couldn 't be taken into account for the annual plan it may be that that might be a reason to bring it straight to council rather than taking time put it through the committee that 's right and then whatever is considered appropriate at that time given whatever timing constraints they might be that would work yeah that 's good okay so no more yawning can you just explain advice how much money 's left in the endowment fund do we need to know the answer to that question in order to pass this resolution to consider this resolution yeah clearly yeah how quickly can we sue Yanni I 'm zooming in as much as you vent you 've asked the question you 're wanting the answer way that you 're intending working or doing off there 's hundreds of thousands left or if there 's just I mean I think I think it 's helpful with these reports that we 're taking money from a fund that was shown you know what how much is this but I 'm happy just if there 's yeah I 'm happy just to take the general yeah no that 's all right but yeah for future reference I think you 're absolutely right I mean it 's the way that you know when we 're allocating from the various funds available at community board meetings for example generally we 'll get a report which shows what the balance of the fund is and you know maybe isn 't whatever what are the calls on it there might be in the meantime as well the other question I had was in regards to the city mission why was the city mission chosen and given that we fund we extensively fund the city mission and have given huge capital grants to them as any of the other funding that was given half of this so the city mission were identified in a meeting of some social service and health providers and one of the reasons was because they were prepared to funding for one of the social workers themselves there was a senior 's of people that actually had the immediate de dépôt Gibson and night shelters I 'm just sorry just trying to understand what we fund a number of programs at the city mission and I 'm just trying to understand if there 's any of the other funding that we 've approved to the city mission that 's actually paying for the same project it 's completely so they 're raising that money through in just two so my understanding is there 's 750,000 remaining in the fund after your imitation so your allocation at the LTP allocated to consider that money so then now all right thank you no further questions okay so this has been moved in Jimmy yes suburban area because like that operation area also have these the papers focus on Central City or covers it was focusing on the central city areas my be of to discuss with thank you so Jimmy you 're happy with that yep all right so moved and seconded is there any debate on this film well I want to strongly support this I think it fits clearly fits alongside that the housing first issue which as a mixed refute report on the Agena tote and it is distinctly separate though although it 's related and I think that 's really important for us as a council to look at the impact of this bigging issue on air streets you cannot walk past and ignore it I believe as council it the behavior is unacceptable often it is impacting on businesses and that is something which in fact we have to support we support our central business district the Association and it 's a good thing and they in effect are asking for the support to so but basically yes we know that in fact when people are homeless they are there 's often a hold of dysfunction attached to their behavior there are a whole of other issues too which are separate from from the homelessness some have a home but this is a distinct issue which there is no doubt our city has to seriously address so I commend the recommendations to you thank you so I 've got Sarah and then Dionne and then Anne Sarah no city in the world has yet solved these issues by simply putting in rules Galatians Melbourne the most liberal city in the world still has homeless sleep net streets and people begging it 's really not easy and there are no silver bullets for these issues and while I agree with 3f that it 's you know it 's a national problem and probably a central government one too late we can 't simply ignore it and local businesses and residents have asked it up have asked us to eight and I think this is a good start thank you deal one of the biggest car feedbacks that I get from people who work in the central city people that visit the central city is around the issue of how they don 't well how they their perceived safety on some of the streets in the city and start to regenerate and actually ever cities seem to that starts to come alive the city centres sort of attracts a lot of people and by attracting a lot of people you 're going to attract those that are looking for opportunities and that 's what I kind of keep saying that these people that we 're trying to help here looking for opportunities whether it 's the right opportunity or the wrong way of going about it but this is I I stress that this issue is around the safety of the central city safety of not just the central city but also areas such as Lynwood village down Colombo and and potentially other parts of the city as Jimmy said I think there is good scope to actually look at areas where this issue is this is you know safety is a big factor and the police are coming to work alongside this and in the future I 'm glad that there 's a six-month sort of review on this because by that stage the police would have gone increased their patrols on the Central City they will look at the other work that we there will happen as well which is the housing first up which we 'll look at next around the homelessness issue because yes they are interlinked but this is really around the safety of our central city and those streets around it so people who want to go to work can actually feel like they 've got a good place to work where productivity can increase and actually everybody can have a good time and make money and be able to pay their rent and do all those good things and have a good time and testing and so this the goal of this is is to address the issues caused by the growing number of Street beggars in our Central City in a compassionate way it 's also to address the concerns there a business community here and the effect that it 's having on the perceptions that people are having and also their sense of safety in there so I think we should be really proud of this is a city I think we as a council we 're leading the to thank the staff working on this in particularly Mary it sort of became quite urgent is we were hearing more and more incidence of with people with feeling sweetened and unsafe and I think the way that this has quickly come together there 's a real credit to everybody this has been going on we 've been meeting and talking about this since February and it 's it 's been a very good foundation laid was the multi agencies coming together and from that strong foundation this has come yeah so we 've got the police who are committing to increase the foot patrol and their presence in the city Central City they want to work with us to get a sustainable outcome and we 've got us who are partnering with the city mission to support a social work outreach service and by providing funding so we 've got two workers who will be on the coalface they 'll be the ones talking to those folks that are sitting out on the street and helping them to find a pathway from the footpath to a fuddy to somewhere purpose to find some hope so we already have a huge amount of resource being put into supporting people what we need and what we have here is a way to actually build on the resource that we already have we already have day programs dragged on with Jeff they run day programs for people there are places for them to go to learn skills to learn it just saloon skills for employment so we already have those things that 's about helping people to find them and we also need to obviously get them into homes for those who don 't have homes so I 'm really pleased and proud of the work that we 've done here I think it 's fantastic so really appreciate your support for this going forward I 'm Jimmy and then Mike ctoc Laden in Central City especially we do this outreach service should be made all those to people 's needs the spatial follows the new beggars all those homeless etc we wear Ibis Hotel in final name post three parent and CTO mallalieu and also church corner more and more of with lost high church there are the city machine we should overall view the the city 's the issue rather than just focus on the central city so I fully we support at the K end point of view also I would like to know to take a city as a whole planner in Central City thank you Mike thank you I will be supporting this no people sleeping rough it and begging in our city centers an obvious issue and there 's many reasons why and it is affecting a lot of people from those people they are sleeping rough and big into people visiting the city businesses people that work in there and you know one has managed to solve this problem but that shouldn 't stop us from trying and who knows this actually could be the Silver Bullet yawning yeah so I was processed enough to be on the council when City machine came and asked for capital funding for their new building we put in two million dollars which was quite considerable and at that time there was a request to see whether they could if you look at what 's happening around the world you can see that community solutions to addressing chronic homelessness and issues of addiction and dealing with really the most expensive people in terms of the cost to the courts health and welfare is to build these these services on the bottom in apartments on top this is actually the most cost-effective solution that is saving a lot of money so I think there 's a there 's a there 's a combination of different things that we can do to address it but fundamentally at some stage just funding workers to go around I think does does become very unsustainable we 've already funded the city mission on so many different levels to deal with people in need and yet what we 're seeing is a growing a growth a hugely growing demand so I think you know I 'm certainly gonna support this today I do think coming out of the capital endowment fund not out of rights this is appropriate the capital endowment fund has really been captured for the economic interests of the city at the today is a chance to actually try Andrea dress that in terms of giving a priority to the social in the community aspect of that fund but I do think we need to start having a wider conversation around why this is happening and what other permanent solutions are just continuing to put band-aids on something isn 't working and we do need to think about the permanent solutions the the frontal part I just made in regards to that is that we do need to get a much better relationship in terms of central government 's response when we 're here you know the deportees coming in from Australia for example when we hear that the central government encouraging people to come to Christ Church is the land of opportunity it 's quite harrowing to see the impact that many of central government 's decisions have on us as a city and yet the support that is not being matched from central government Auckland 's just announced I think 250 beard bedroom apartments up and Gray 's Avenue they 've actually got government funding services on the bottom and like that being done here and yet a lot of the issues I believe is to do with central government in terms of what they 've done in terms of the responsibility that they have and we need to get them actually addressing these issues much better than what they are but I 'm happy to support this today Glen oh thank you these government in these government and this is a different government so what I liked I was just showing you that red tae-young so just what I wanted to say is that actually the city mission is already running the service you just talked about so across the road in Herefords Street in the last term of council we approved funding for transitional emergency housing along with the Social Work component so we have that the kind of more established part of the mission on one side of here if it 's Street and then on the other side we have that model that you 've been talking about my view is that we need to do all that we can to address this not all of Sunday and lattimer 's Square are homeless and in fact there 's quite a queue that reflects the desperation and the the lack of options that some people in our city have so I really important for money at 70,000 in terms of other spins that we have on the council so hopefully a unanimous vote today regardless of where the responsibility for this naturally falls I think it 's fair to say that um you know a number of people in the city and a number of people if not everybody around this table would share my disappointment when I walk down Herefords Street when I see people sleeping on the street wrapped in blankets with a few possessions wrapped up in another blanket or maybe in a shopping trolley or something when I see people huddled in doorways on Colombo Street and sleeping on the streets and that 's something that shouldn 't be happening in any city but he certainly shouldn 't be happening in Christchurch and it 's something that we don 't want to see happening here and you know regardless of where the natural we 've got a part to play in finding a solution and I think that this is that part that we can play in finding a solution I hope it works I hope it goes some way towards working if it some brings about some improvement that 'll have been a good thing so there have been you know a number of issues raised in this debate but in terms of what we 're dealing with today I think this is a positive step and it 'll be great to see some positive outcomes as a result of it and I know that a lot of work has gone into this from a number of councillors and also from staff and I just like to take the opportunity to thank you for the work that you 've put into it and I 'll be just as interested as those that have been close to it in seeing some some good outcomes come out of it so I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye against that 's carried thank you so now moving on _"

    "text": "good that was probably just enough time for Tim to get my coffee yeah and so the next item on the agenda is the northern arterial witches and Northern Corridor secondly well yeah it 's a supplementary yep and so Richard I 'm going to invite you to provide some an overarching sort of commentary on or you can invite one of your team to provide a sort of kind of overarching commentary on what this paper has been designed to achieve and why we are where we are now and the decision that we are being asked to make thank you thank you madam chair and firstly if I just do a couple of introductions to my writers Dave or drift who is a safety engineer from beaker so an independent safety engineer to my Leif was here from counsel both assisting on this project so perhaps just a bit of an overview of where this project sits and might be useful to provide a little bit of context so that Christchurch Northern Corridor is one of the Christchurch runs that 's it 's really two separate but interdependent bridge to just south of QE to drive the Christchurch City Council portion of the project is from just south of q2 Drive so exactly where we meet with the NZTA just south of the Cranford Innes intersection so and those projects are now known as the Christchurch Northern Corridor and it 's been procured is one one delivery project on what 's called a competitive alliance and that 's where we work with the contractors the designers in New Zealand Transport Agency to deliver the project as one project so that was what councilors signed unto so prior to now council has agreed to purchase property who 'd been through all the Resource Management Act approvals and there 's a designation and that sits within our district plan so that the corridor is denoted in our district plan for writing purposes we 've had funding confirmed within the within the LTP and we 'll also signed a multi-party funding agreement on it the cross-section just north of the Cranford Anderson section and up to McFadden 's has previously been approved by council as well this report though as that hopefully that is required by the organization because we still need to do the detailed traffic resolutions so that is still to come so there have been a number of approvals to date but there 's still a further one to come the other point I think had makers that this project is different but also related to the downstream effects project which we 've recently done some consultation on so essentially as part of the RMA approvals there were specific conditions of the designation which required the preparation of a downstream effects management plan and that 's something that we 've recently engaged with the public on and we will take that information and give it to the independent expert who we 've engaged to help prepare that particular document so two different projects but again interrelated in terms of today we 're asking the council to approve or reject parking on the section of Cranford Street north of McFadden 's Road approve the relocation of the bus stops approval for the intersection layout for that Cranford Annis intersection and these recommendations are part of the overall scheme approval extension so that 's the part of our part of this project so south of qe2 drive and up to Cranford Street and the Cranford Street upgrade but as I mentioned previously we 'll have to come back to Council for the detailed resolutions if this is approved today referring you to the report that 's in front of you we have the community board recommendations to Council in terms of the section of Cranford Street north of mcfillin 's Road at page six of my agenda that shows the general layout or the cough that cross section so that shows the one point four meter wide grass boom on the eastern side the two point five meter wide shared path the shared path on the western side the park in Lane the clearance triple Centro so that is the broad overview of that cross section of what we are recommending to council for that portion of Cranford Street which is north of mcfillin 's road it also seeks confirmation of the design for the Cranford owners intersection the relocation of the bus stops and as part of the report were put in was bringing forward funding for the completion of the length of the Paranoid parallel to Christchurch Northern Corridor so essentially the Christchurch northern corridor has a shared user path down the length of it and certainly on the on the Cranford street side it is on the western side of that in just north of the commercial area on Cranford Street the idea is to connect up that she had use a path on the western side of Cranford street with the peffern or parallel now currently within our LTP that sits within years 22 23 I think and this resolution seeks to bring their forward so by the time the Christchurch northern corridor is open there will be a connection between the shared use the path that forms part of the christ ' additional Coronel and the pepper newly parallel obviously the pepper new parallel was one of our major cycle routes and that provides a high level surf service for cyclists so that 's the overview madam chair thank you very much so do we have questions and pulling air and yeah look I 'm a warning it 's 1550 k thank you good clarification and the resolution as well because we released the detailed traffic pollution resolutions to the community final approval community board for and so far [Music] yellow lines at each room for parking issues that sense with the community but we end in definitely the community board so that they should be secret because I sit with the community board I think most of the other if it 's not delegated to the board 's we 'll ask the board recommended to you no I just wanted to note to see to see discussion point on the western side of the shield part and it was due to the fact that they so we 've asked the staff to look at addressing it so there 's no pinch point and they live to come back that 's correct when we come back to the community board council part of the detailed design process the other point six as far as I 'm aware we already were you already okay now look I 've got I had Mike Aaron Yanni gleaned as process there a scheme designed as approved on the basis of just a plan with no written detail in terms of the scheme designed so what normally it would be a plan yes that 's that 's approved by the organization the report itself might provide some description of what the riders but I don 't think that 's a requirement so in this game design that we 're looking at now it 's also got a cycle way that 's on leads to the east side of Cranford Street when we know that 's not actually the case and so today we 're asked to approve a scheme design that is not correct so you saw responded to that question that the scheme design as part of the attachment does erroneously show a cycle way on the eastern side but we 'd anticipated clearing that up as part of the detailed design process so when we come back for the final traffic resolutions we 've provided an updated plan so the process were at the moment is that the Alliance who delivering this project are still finalizing the detailed to Council for the final and detailed traffic resolutions and we would pick up on that issue of the soccerway on the eastern side of the intersection there where the northern arterial extension hats so looking at the whole project for the council part of it and obviously the the northern extension normal material extension there 's quite a bit of work already been done on it why is it now coming to Council to approve this game design when it 's so far along in construction so these projects like this go through a pretty detailed process and when they go through the the RMA process the final designers never sorted out completely so it provides an indication of what the project will look like at that stage and then there 's a very iterative process where you go through and go through the specimen design to the detailed design so we 're now at that stage where they 're liance is up and running and they are delivering the project and there 's normal for us to come back to council once the detailed designers complete or almost so that 's a situation where we 're now and it 's not December 2 what we 've done on on other projects across the on the road in intensive so this section of crampon street will be a mix right so it allowed for cyclists to be on the road south of McFadden 's between the extension and the cyclists will be it so there 's there 's a wide shared user path for pedestrians and cyclists on the western side of cream for street but but they will still be the ability for cyclists to use that the minimum before for a mixed road car park is four point three meters and it should be with the low-speed environment obviously we 're doing ok and so sought to sant encouraged to use cream for street and that 's the purpose of putting that shared path on that western side so they are trying to get the cyclists on I mean eventually cream for street will become busy just not an ideal environment for the cyclists so that 's why it 's not really encourage that mode and if going to keep you on the road because the desires to try and kids much of it share path you know ultimately to pull them across a pepper new parallel so we can go below that four point three requirement it 's a good one and it 's a goblin piece practice and it 's where you know that 's where the judgment has to come into play and is it adequate or not in this particular situation it 's actually that four point two meters actually three point two meter painted lane so you have got that edge alignments go otherwise quite often is just a wide curbside Lane so the lanes actually been differ not defined by the edge line which creates it one meter buffer to the parking spaces no Spartan spacing themselves a two point one which is a comfortable space guideline and the document says this with there 's an absolute minimum and should be used in a low-speed environment which we know it 's not going to be a low-speed environment we know there 's going to be 40,000 I 'm just concerned because the motorcycle way route a block away and so therefore a lot of cyclists will use that but if you 're quite a confident cyclist and you 're going up Cranford street so you 're choosing not to use the major so quick you 're most likely going to stay on the road and it concerns me I guess that we are put in an A and we 're going to install a road marking instead of actually really below what you 've been told to do I mean if we 're I mean if we 're i doing the measure of a hundred millimetres what you could do is take that parking space to enter two meters and give another hundred miles to the yeah so I mean we 're probably arguing a little bit over the paint on the position so it could be accommodated yes you get to point one sport at generous but and studies have shown that no one point ninety two meters can be a so one last question and confirm that cyclists coming from redwood will be able to get on to the plans and come bit you on that one well suck away runs along the northern tier trying to make sure that redwood can actually access I would assume but this a week of just cheating that and take I 'm happy to take a look questions hey there 's a does the underpass there wonders right it renders Road in the will be there should be a connection through the yeah so I 'm just reminding people that this has been through the community board so Aaron yes I just got the cross-section drawing from McFadden 's up to the interchange but there isn 't a cross-section drawing from valence to NS Weiss thing so that 's already been approved by council okay and that the medium for that cross section was see quite specifically and the decisions while the hearings commissioners so that once they were seat what the woods there there was a limited ability to change them right in the again near the three three point one and two point five meter she had pathways a great that via but then when you get down towards the not the ability to carry them through down at the long so north of McFadden 's the rotors significantly wider it 's about South McFadden 's a bit it 's a bit 10 meters lease so it is a constrained environment south of McFadden 's and that 's the cross section that was approved by council right so that when you look at that I 'm on page four of yours 21 of ours the mean you 've come from Ennis and I 'm looking at mainly at the left hand side at the moment that you 've got the footpath and then there 's that white line and the yellow lines and that for no parking if they 'd been a sheared pathway out to say that would that have worked or just can 't sorry counselor I 'm not could you just I 'm not sure we really just north of just north of McAdams or Venice are north of Venice the woods for the Krampus treat cross-section are essentially a footpath of 1.7 1.2 cycle lane and 3.10 traffic lanes with a reasonably generous median so we the decision back in 2016 was to have a separate footpath and on road signs and then finally the the other one is your page 219 just the the designs we 've got the two roundabouts on qe2 drive so a we paying for everything from Kiwi to drive no it 's it 's so the Zealand Transport Agency managed that part of the project just south of the EM sections and we pick up their area to just south of the Cranford in us and section but I think the key thing to remember with south of the cream-filled earnest intersection is that we also have the downstream effects project here so any designs we put in soon may be temporary in nature so in my question there was violence there money to waste that was the kind of the over speaking around winters road that you 've got a whole Lane coming off the roundabout there an end going on with the motorway from winters Road was winters road had been cut off for the last 15 20 years you could come off further up which you still can which actually created like a nice week pocket environment and now you 've got it seems like they 're spending millions of dollars to make the neighborhood less desirable so winter 's road has got the the currently an instruction of the the subway at the moment so that 'll be a pedestrian link so traffic coming out of winters Road will simply connect up with Cranford Street but it also you might be able to drive up winters anymore I thought that was all so beta under the motorway there was there two pedestrian subway only Bruce you 're in the cyclist Wow big enough for a car that 's it yeah maybe a Bambino okay yeah you know Thanks I just want to check um on page 21 there 's a bus stop that 's in the entire lane of traffic and I just wondered if we 'd had any safety audits around that placement I 'm it 's just outside two five eight Cranford straight I just recalled that we tried a similar scheme and Hills Road the bus border thing where the bus stopped in disaster I think from memory and I 'm just concerned about heavy vehicles particularly you know in a that 's forty five thousand cars going through here so that the bus stops and Line bus stops and these sorts of bus stops as it basically gives priority to the bathroom I mean the buses can immediately resume triple after a quick stop even be away again after poking up and dropping off passengers but we have placed them with Kia so certainly when you see the locations there some thought has gone into it it does provide a slightly higher level service the recommended guidelines which is a bus stop every 400 odd meters I think these ones are spaced out at every 300 meters so have we considered putting a bus priority lane down here it seems an ideal opportunity just to put one lane for high occupancy vehicles and buses so one of the benefits of this project will be to take traffic from both mass runs in main North Road in main North Road as identified as a key PT route then from the north because that got the draft regional public transport plan it is proposed that I think one of the revised routes for the orbited orbiter would be up a portion of Cranford Street so you would get and the orbiter runs every 15 minutes so you will get a read more mountain passes there in terms of our HIV or high occupancy vehicle now and you 'll be aware that the third southbound lane on the Y map bridge is proposed to go on with travel demand management measures such as high occupancy vehicles and I think one of the considerations of this organization will be what happens downstream too so just trying to understand specifically for the scheme design that you 've come up with here what we 're doing to reduce people getting into cars rather than just increasing the capacity for more cars which it appears to be doing so given that we 've got the third lane on the bridge being an HOV bus priority type lane I mean I can 't understand why why we wouldn 't have just extended that all the way through here to reduce occupancy vehicles so so I think you 're right but personally I 'd say we need to look at this in the round and as I mentioned part of the benefit of the project is to reduce the amount of vehicles using Maine North Road so that key PT route becomes freer for buses so that as the benefits of this and that is your key bus route into town however in terms of the HIV you 're right that there may be a need for us to consider TDM measures as part of our network and that 's something when NZTA finalized their design for what happens on the third southbound lane that we as an organization would need to consider I think obviously we won 't get it today but it 's really hard to see in terms of site off-road cycle ways on road cycle ways we 're the kind of cycle routes go through this area how people access them etc which I just think they 'll be really useful for us to actually get a kind of map showing the different cycling facilities in this of interact we can we can certainly wide you with some information on it but as I mentioned previously there was a shared user path along the width of the corridor and the hope is that that will connect in with the Paranoid parallel just north of the commercial area north of McClendon straight so it 's just a small connection that needs to be made so just that does that shared path go all the way up to that that new sort of commercial development that so the idea is with the third southbound lane on the Y met bridge that would also include a cycle lane on that as well oh sorry just we went as Road comes in to crimp it straight as that as the shared lane continued all the way so the shared use a path and would be along the length of the corridor so and part of their path would be through that you 'd have connection through winter 's path and that 's the subway so it 's a it 's a label service for pedestrians and cyclists sorry it 's just it 's kind of missing from the map but I see on the not the motorway side on the other side of crap third Street going north that 's gonna have a shared pathway is this the Western so it 's going to have a shared pathway all the way up to Maine this road so the the shared use of path will come along the the western side of the northern arterial extension that will cross cram for Street and then go along the western side of cream for street where our anticipation is that it will just before the commercial area so we 're place makers is as we 'll be in deviate to connect up at the paper okay so we 're talking about you 're talking about the city side I 'm talking about the Northlands mall side of Cranford straight so if you 're going up to Maine North Road along Cranford Street and you don 't want to go and I maybe the question that might ask about getting access to Redwood I 'm not sure but if you wanted to get up to straight and you 're cycling right once you go past that northern roundabout so if you were going to North install why would you do that one earth would you stay on Cranford Street well why would you go in the northern arterial to go to read one no silence will take the most direct route and if this is a direct route in a shed popular it 's not it goes up and then down you 'd have to literally go up and then down it doesn 't make sense to go that way yeah okay so maybe we can get the information back I just think that would be really helpful I mean the final question was um was one the crash of southern motorway roundabouts designs have I think we 've got a lesser of the worst intersections I think it 's ranked in one of the top intersections for safety in our city now which one there Christchurch South motorway the holes will you 'd the two roundabouts we 've had a lot of crashes and accidents I just seem sort of gone off the page of balance and I just wanted to know what safety audit we 've done off those roundabouts to ensure that we don 't get a repeat of that quite frankly the ridiculous situation at southern motorway we 're a brand-new highway as one of the worst intersections in the city so my understanding of those two is that they will be redone as part of the Christchurch southern motorway to so that those two intersections were put in as part of the CC in original package works sees him towards the connection out to cross top and with the increased traffic flows they do reconsider those intersections no I 'm sorry the question has really run the safety order of the proposed and roundabouts in this plan and like just to ensure that we don 't really do them when we get sixty thousand or a hundred thousand cars coming through with the proposed development of my Mac so certainly all these proposals go through an extensive from safety order regime and post construction safety order that we do want before the final design is done and you do want gateways and part of that gateway is a safety order process right and just in the final thing so if we didn 't want to widen this to be like bronze straight and we just wanted like say for example two lanes going in the direction during the peak so you know two lanes going north after work in two lanes coming south before work and and just leaving one lane is there an option that we 've considered why is it being ruled out or what are we able to give that make that decision today are you talking about south of the Cranford tunnel section or were you talking as part of the Christchurch Northern Corridor well it 's basically once the motorway comes in the proposal that we seem to have in front of us is to basically to encourage straight into another braum Strait and for those of us who have got concerns around what that will do I would have thought a sensible option would have been just looking at putting adequate provision for the cycling and parking by not having four lanes only having in which those get addressed so I think it 's quite different to Brian straight in terms of the adjacent land uses are quite a bit of this history green fields area and only small portion goes through what are sustainably residential with a small amount of commercial but but well this whole process has been through a very extensive scheme design detailed design process and a number of options were considered and what we 've put in front of you today is pretty similar to what went to the hearings commissioners so they improved this and that 's the the two lanes southbound the two lanes northbound and that in terms the traffic flows which are already considerable and predicted to get bigger and that 's certainly our view of what you need is two lanes in either direction in Sarah thank you my question is over a part of the bigger report page it spoke Paul for you but it 's place 75 for us where it talks about buffer zones and there 's a recommendation up on the screen it 's not it 's item P which that bicker recommendation and it might be a viewer actually officer board members so it talks about the buffer zone you know it 's important to minimize during so just we can sync with the buffer zone we talking about on the shape okay it 's one that talks about the east so there 's a narrow shear path on the eastern side of them is a wider shear path on the western side yeah and the idea is to have these and this was one of the resolutions community quarters it 's a good idea of some of us what we 've done in other parts of the city has really put on this painted buffer so just people were aware of you know that the proximity of what they 're doing to cyclists pedestrians why it 's not uncommon and it 's just to know correct me if I 'm wrong Dave an additional safety vision so they get your traffic away from those Park period cars on the road yeah and it just if I can ask you a question too in the paragraph below you say may not be required as that more commentary on the cost-benefit ratio because if I 'm out there myself with their own with 100 cyclists or on my own I still have the same percentage of being gored yeah so is that what you 're you know you 're coming with yes so what was recommended is that the actual parking along that road side is actually not time restricted so we were expecting a lot of those businesses will go and park there on the right so it 's only going to get used probably in the morning peak and evening pick of cars arriving to work and going home so that 's also minimizing the amount that the car is going to get so that 's just another kind of mitigation of trying to keep that risk to a minimum but in terms of the cyclists on the western side the idea is that they would come off the shared user path and connect up with the peppery parallel which is obviously if required they will service but we recognize that some cyclists may not so they can crossing point of just mcfillin 's and they would have to cross at that part to get onto the eastern side of transit and then there is a painted cycle line not a separate one painted cycle own along that portion of Cranford street and confident cyclists can take that so but but it is it 's not a wide cycle lane and we would be encouraging people to use the pepper new parallel because their office a high level since obviously they 'll be going against the flow of traffic sometimes with visibility both ways it 's probably the eastern side that the shared use of path is minimum width but but it only services there 's currently 19 properties on that side so it 's a minimum number of people are actually going to use it there is a central subdivision just a little bit to the north but again that 's not a significant number of additional residential properties that will come into play if there gets approved so on the eastern side we 're anticipating pretty low demand of cyclists and pedestrians as well yep Sarah before I ask the other ones um cyclists actually going to be legally banned from cycling on the northern arterial extinction or are they just discouraged to use it so I know that cyclists are actually allowed to bike on all state highways and things question the extension no I 'm not saying are they legally allowed to buy it because it 's a very direct route to get to some places and that 's why cars are going to want to use it and cyclists bike along and state highways okay a cyclists Bend from here nice day so it 's not my understanding is it 's not proposed to band cyclists right sir so while you 're saying but very few properties there may be 19 currently residential properties with our potential extra small subdivision to the north of them the ponds on the eastern side there is actually the potential for cyclists to be biking down the extension end and through I mean they 're not likely to be you 're interested but concerned clearly about confident cyclists getting from the north into town can legally choose space where they have a minimum worth shared path adjacent to residential driveways and they could be coming in either direction because it 'll be bi-directional as a shared path and that doesn 't seem to be a safe way of getting cyclists to wherever they want to go as the the potential to have may be no 1 metre boom at all I could and safety first and distribute that extra meter in the road corridor to be able to put proper cycle lanes painted on the road cyclists may choose to stay out not use this you do sir paths on the eastern side and stay on the road yeah so there was always that opportunity I think when you start to push them pull with the you know the boom and the the 1 meter buffer but you can do those sorts of things but but I think there 's also always consequential effects of doing that and it 's our view and certainly days view is a qualified safety engineer that this is the best lay out there and the buffer is useful but it won kind of distance between parked cars and the traffic using that part of the part of Cranford Street but Dave do you want I mean the 1 meter kind of buffer that we have got a minute is minimal for a cyclist I mean a softest envelope is about a meter mm-hm so you will be very close to there that 's slow lane and it 's where what expect a lot of the trucks and things will be traveling along so it 's not gonna be a very nice environment for a cypress and it 's we 're I mean ideally they would be swapping over to that western side or what they may use that she a pass on that eastern side the risk of voiding that shared path closer to those properties again you start affecting sight lines of those residents coming out their driveways as well so we don 't want to kind of encourage the sockets to go too close to the boundary because a lot of fences and vegetation down here as well so there is a bit of a balancing act if we one point 8 meter wide pedestrian path leaving an extra point 8 plus the the 1 metre boom potentially so you could have an extra one point eight which is a standard width cycle lane that could be painted on either side of the road and if its safety foods to like the new GPUs it would seem to me that actually providing a safe space for cyclists would be much better than having them on the small sheets half anyway the so I mean I mean I would prefer that we wouldn 't doing these can I gave it to the RMA process so this is this has been through the scheme designed for the extension that we 've been asked to approve today 's been through the area new process is that right that 's correct so went through the aramean RMA process it was heard by three independent commissioners there were two appeals to the Environment Court and those are agreed by can consent so the Environment Court sealed initiative the consent order early February I think 2016 okay so without a project that we 've got or the ite committee in that case if we 'll sign off before it goes to an RMA process and I think about sort of the Humphreys Drive section there so actually councils been through that process and and it seems to me that there seems to be the wrong way around so council wouldn 't have much of an option now that it 's been to court for example why didn 't we get this beauteous so council always has the opportunity put some strain into legal realm here but the opportunity to make its own independent decisions under the Local Government Act so council may choose to do something but difference from the RMA but but you 've always got that risk that if you do do that then there might be consequences of that I 've been inconsistent with the RMA decision and us having to seek changes to either designation conditions or something else so speaks to why we should have made a decision on the scheme design before it went through the Aria process doesn 't it because it 's what we 're doing with 's certainly happening with with all of them and as I mentioned in my premium bow at the beginning this has been through a number of council processes including property purchase with signed agreements it 's been through the RMA process we 've agreed on a cross-section of it so it has been through a funding than our LTP there 's been numerous briefings to committees etc so it has been through a number of approvals but but we 're now at the detailed design phase and once the detailed design gets shaped up that 's when we normally bring these projects back to Council and say well look we had a scheme design and that 's what we thought it looked like would be now a lot further along in terms of the process and now this is what we know it 's going to look like borrow a few amendments and that 's women to bring it to the organization for approval so to bring it earlier on to me would have been problematic because there would have been a number of changes that would have been subject long term plan process that we have another major road without a cycle as a Memorial Avenue where people I guess in the past I 'm encouraged to use other other ways to get into town and that we saw quite a strong number of submissions on people wanting a cycle lanes on their on that space and it seems like it 's a very similar space to two Cranford street here and councillors were I think many of them sort of swayed by the need for a cycle lane down there seem to me that if we 're putting in a similar type of Road we might look to to do that proactively beforehand rather than wait to the demand as the later on the down the track and then try to retrofit is there a chance for this to go back now to actually have that really looked at actually putting proper cycle lanes on the road before Cranford Street as you 're weird the project has been delivered south of McFadden 's Road we are constrained by space the corridor is only 20 21 meters wide if be widened something else would need to give whether it be the median whether it be the footpath or we 'd need to get into property pictures so my thinking the time for that has passed and if you do get into that now that would have implications on the delivery of the project and costs for council but but that the section south of McFadden 's did come to council and it has been approved they 're just a follow up on on that aerobics get some clarification is it possible as it stands right now to be able to remove a section of or reduce the boom on the Eastside Crete change that shared path on the east side to a footpath reduce the car parks to two meters and actually create cycle lanes and stall for everything else in there is room for that but the problem is we have to look at the utilities and Iran I 've got some digital infrastructure on me and that may have to be shifted and it has to be shifted it 's quite costly so this here fits in there might be an issue with the curbs and I could interfere with the infrastructure but so it 's possible though and we could look into it and if it is actually doable we could actually go down that road and actually creates a slightly safer environment yeah my only concern would be that you 'd be promoting it 's all plain hard up against a parking zone as well so that probably increases that risk adoring by encouraging cyclists use the roads it 's been if they 're trying to get them off the roads to minimize it during and you know in that door one 's going to occur on a very very busy road as well so if you want to try and avoid that door you 're going to Pro you not being in the live traffic plane as well so yeah I guess totally accept where you 're coming from and it will give you an extra hundred metres to allocate clearance trip so you could be up to one and a half metres for a cyclist which is good but their concern the airliners very very busy road just it 's probably a trade-off so all right so that seems to be everyone 's questions dealt with I 'm always nervous with these ones obviously because of previous history with the Northern Corridor you know that the council all counts and always you know I would say by majority and not incredibly happy with with the bronze projects of the previous government and the imposition that this project has on our budget but we have signed up for it and that was a long time ago and we 're committed to it I 'm you know I understand that that you know that that people will want to debate this and to and to vote on it I suppose the thing that that makes me just a little bit nervous about the whole thing is that where we where we end up so so I will move the emotion as it is and ask for a seconder for it Aaron and I 'll open for debate Jonnie consistent would have previously voted on this project I won 't be supporting this today I think think about the future by having a much smarter way of encouraging people to move through our city and I think the reality the sad reality for this project as this is all about enabling more development in Waimakariri this is all about creating greater urban sprawl on some of our most versatile soils in the city this is about the most unsustainable approach that we could have to development that is being approached being applied here and it 's no criticism of the staff because I do appreciate that these agreements that have been signed at staff having tasks to do that work but you know it 's just such a lost opportunity when we think about putting a third line on the on the bridge and not to have this as an HOV Lane but just to have it for all traffic to use I think there 's just really disappointing having bus stops in the middle of high volume traffic lanes I think creates all sorts of safety problems in terms of visibility of people crossing roads cars stopping cars swerving out so I look at what road all you 're going to see is more and more traffic it 's not the sustainable approach the whole idea of not using people coming down Martians road which has got a lot less communities along it then this one I thought was really sensible instead what we 're doing is trying to chance to have that traffic onto this part of the network and the downstream effects are going to be massive so I won 't support this today I think the real tragedy is also the fact that we don 't seem to have a very good system of off-road separated cycleways connecting our city and the point that counts or Scanjet has made which I totally endorse as we need to start thinking about not just getting from a psycho way in the middle of town to the farthest reach of a suburb but actually actually how people within the area access the cycleways to go to things like schools or places of employment and I just can 't see that endless design so I won 't be supporting this today and I just would say know is going to happen in the future which is that change is going to happen very quickly and we 're much better spending less money on more flexible and dynamic solutions rather than huge amounts of money on fixed and hardwired infrastructure Pauline approved of the wrong scheme but it 's also an imposition on our community particularly Center Albans they 're feeling it really hard so for us to do nothing today for us to do none of these you know lines and parking adjustments and bus stop movements would it be a recent position I think this is only going to help the traffic to flow there 's been really good compromise through the consenting process was the businesses and residences around here compromised that perhaps pro cyclists and pedestrians would probably not agree with but we 're son parking has been retained but some removed and I think it 's all about finding balance and remembering that cyclists in that area do have options I think it 's really important to remember that so they don 't have to ride down there but we have made 're trying to accommodate safety and traffic flow in an area without property purchases and basically it 's really challenging and we all know the constraints of the scheme is acid I don 't support an arterial the community I know is really supportive of a investigating a park-and-ride today Jamie okay I 'll keep this relatively brief but I I think it 's just important to stress that the city doesn 't indicate kids cakes you know this is about a growing city in a connected city it 's about adequate infrastructure and I think not mating making calls like this today would be akin to the Auckland Council in the 1980s where they look back and they rue the day that they didn 't adequately plan for the future so I will be supporting this today and I think future generations will thank us for it and I think it 's most certainly well over Joe okay Mike thank you I actually think we potentially making the same mistakes Auckland red by not actually investing and real sustainable transport network this is just another car project that 's day and actually encourage people to move out of out of Christchurch firstly I just want to I 'll probably vote simply on a couple of the issues the first part of the issue around the northern natural extension adds I can 't support it partly due partly based on principle last year as the chair of the local Community Board I did not support the project in our City Council I still do not support this project a twelfth moment of three hundred million dollar plus motorway designed to get cars into and out of christchurch easily it 's it 's just not where we should be hitting you know made a way that 's going to put forty five thousand vehicles onto creme fraiche Street daily increasing emission emissions and literally splitting a community in half and we missed a real opportunity to create a people focus sustainable transport and it worked for the north of Christchurch when this project was agreed to but we still need to keep an open mind on one of those lanes becoming HOV and PT and in the future it is so be affected by this this project also do have issues with the scheme design to me when we agree into a design purely based on a plan that is clearly wrong it 's got cycleways that aren 't going to to exist so I there 's another reason why I can 't support number one I 'm the second part of the resolution I cannot support I believe there are safety concerns in there that give me real concern you know although the recent release of the government policy statement on land transport has safety in access as one of the two strategic priorities we 're about to approve a plan that in my opinion will create one of the most unsafe major to our roads in our city for our most vulnerable road users and I don 't think that 's actually good enough I would like to acknowledge the community board for a number of extra provisions they 've added to the staffs recommendation to actually try and increase the safety the community boards actually you know I 've been very close to this project for it for I tried to do the best they can out of a bad situation I do support the upgrade of the intersection I think you know as far as the community 's concern is one of the only benefits they 're actually going to get from this this project and it 's been been wanted for a for a long long time I 'd also like to voice my disappointment around the consultation on this item for such a major project that only a very limited number of people were consulted with and that the community board only found out about this consultation bikes and on the very last day of it is actually unbelievable and it 's actually also not knowing if you want to hope this never happens again basically to wrap it up now I cannot support a project funded by rates that is going to adversely affect Christchurch community by this much so the people on the other side of the river can get into christchurch quicker process rather than the substance of what 's here I mean I 'm aware that the community board have obviously that it was well discussed at the community board meeting but what I 'm hearing is people proposing to vote against the proposal that 's in front of us which has come obviously by majority from the community board I 'm not hearing anybody proposing any amendments are not hearing anybody foreshadowing any further motion that means that if there were a majority of people who went with the sort of comments that have already been made in debate and people voted against what we 've got in front of us here we would have a scheme that we were committed to that we had no design for at the very least from the report that shows that we 'd be up for considerable additional expense and it may be that we will be left in a completely untenable so I 'm a little bit confused how people can be proposing to vote against what we 've got in front of us without proposing any alternative that allows this project to proceed if what people are really saying is they don 't want the project to proceed at all then taken in our long term plan so you know I mean maybe I 'll make a comment it 's very easy to vote against things when you 're expecting to be in a minority and therefore the outcome of the vote will be the recommendation but a position can be taken of voting against I think we need to be very careful that we don 't end up with a majority of people voting against this and therefore no way forward so really comments more around process and outcomes than the substance of what we 've got in front of us Sarah I 'd like to foreshadow option two in my speech consists of Yanam might have said all it needs to be said and I 'm not going to vote in favor of this way when it 's not safe for all road users all right so Erin yeah sorry I can 't_''_3628.61 I can 't help myself this one the having lived in in the area for quite a long time it 's not just about people north of the bridge there 's a lot of people at it 's the part of the and access to the inner city if you don 't have a successful inner city we we need this if Canterbury 's to grow to a potential population or greater christchurch of around a million people was foreseeable in our lifetime we will need this but it was planned in the 1960s and currently we 've got 23,000 cars a day traveling an extra kilometre unnecessarily because the work wasn 't done 20-30 years ago so if you want to reduce carbon that 's the way to do it and you have to ask yourself when you 're an elected member on a council is it your job to dictate to people the way they should live their lives or facilitate the way they want to live their lives and this we 're going to bring in Carlos days or have Border Patrol 's and don 't make them get out of their car and walk they just won 't_''_3688.85 we can encourage cycling and I 'm fully supportive of that will never have a public transport system with the density of population that public transport system that can add to the package but we have to facilitate vehicles and heavy vehicles and cars that are coming in and out of a successful City and do it as pragmatically as we can and stop getting in the way and encourage people to use the cycle way which is one block away and it 's a multi-million dollar huge asset to the city it 's a great essay and even if we put up little signs to let them know how how bad for their body carbon monoxide is so biking on one of the busiest roads and sucking up as much carbon monoxide as you can isn 't that smart you might look calling you in you 're like crap but move over one block you 'll live longer [Laughter] right okay yeah I 've already made made the statements that that I wanted to make so I 'll put the motion so so proves the scheme designed so sorry what why do you want them separately oh sorry I thought you mean put 1 2 secretly I was having difficulty understanding why you 1 2 but we might as well do a vote on it so have you got them things set up oh do it manually okay all right so I 'll just get that cold yep yes pencil human yes great okay so now we 'll move on to the the balance of the resolutions three to six so I 'll put those now all those in favor say aye those opposed say no so they know is just you Yanni just and and Sarah Sarah Templeton opposed as well thank you so how are we going for time 1242 _"

    "text": "earthquake symposium just an update for accounts of us to to see what open the right agenda right here we go Kenneth crate symposium so this is just an noting report I just will make one point in relation to the under the budget as you can see this strategy and transformation group topics budget for recovery planning this was always intended to be part of the resilience plan process with lessons learned so there is funding within the organization for this but the bullet point that CSS the symposium and workshop events are of invitation-only no charge for attendance will be applied that hasn 't been decided yet so we 're going to have a further conversation with with the other side with DPM see about that came to Bri so that makes it both accessible but also a much more reasonable cost in terms of the venue so we 'll continue to make sure that the costs are watched and keep it kept a lid on I think this is an important process the first there will be a set of workshops around some of the issues focused things that we didn 't do so well we wouldn 't want to see some things repeated but obviously we want to share those and and then on to the on to the on to the symposium itself there is an intention to to real reach forward to a a major international conference happening here in Christchurch and and 2021 which will be the tenth anniversary of the february earthquake and i think that if you look at what happened on here ago and Japan after the or hugo prefecture after the Kobe earthquake and 1995 ten years later a major conference the in fact it was the UN conference on disaster risk reduction their World Congress conference on disaster miss reduction was held there and the Hugo framework was what came from it and of course now the Sendai framework has emerged from the conference and sim died the next international conference and that regard is not due until I think I think it 's not till 2030 I think they went further than the ten years I think they went to 15 years I attended the Sendai conference timed and placed international conference to Lincoln between Sendai and the next international conference on disaster risk reduction so I think we 've got something to offer the world and will do more importantly by then so I 'll move that we note the report and sitting to Becerra any discussion Jonnie oh just one question and the five-point-two with the workshop and symposium planning and it talks about the five different workshops and I know that there 's still a lot of organizational stuff to happen but I just I just wanted to understand how much sustainability and environmental impacts where we will be discussed it 's just not clear from five point to that there 's consideration of that but I 'm not to these early days so yeah well we 're having an internal workshop tomorrow so I 'll just I 'll just make a note of that it certainly will come up and the procurement delivery models issue building standards assessments and quality assurance so but that is not the only area where environmental considerations would apply but the procurement delivery models would certainly raise the sort of makes reference to there 's been a Canterbury fight and international focus and so it 's something that is seen as people in the city who 've been through the experience will be able to come in and get a you know involved or is it more for people to come in and look at what 's happened here I mean no so the workshops are more along along those lines in order to focus on specific issues but there are there is an enormous range of research that 's already been done and but there are also gas and it 's important that the workshops identify where through the work needs needs to be done but the intention is is that the workshops would then focus on that workshops would then essentially report on to the symposium so but it will be as I understand videoed so there it can be put online and people will be able to access the presentations as they were with the international speaker series which you might recall yeah but those were those were open to the public they were half we want to do as as to have a repetition of that we need to have a very focused group of people considering both the community elements of the recovery and the business side of it in the procurement so I 'm and I think that these are really picking up the the core issues that the major international conference in 2020 one will be able to pick up other other stuff as well and that will be open to all so I 'll put Oh blame and then deal thank you I support this and I support it particularly given that the the funding comes from an existing budget I think that 's really good and I 'm sure it will prove to be good value for money and that we as a city and province have much to contribute to the worldwide conversation over disaster and once that in the time after part of me is thinking in one of the bullet points it 's it 's talks about share lessons learned I 'm tempted to say still being learned you know we now think of outstanding insurance you could say that something like that outstanding insurance claims touches on mental health business recovery and the commercial sector recovery leadership and governance and building standards too so I think we have a lot to contribute there we also have a lot to contribute by way of the the kind of thesis on disaster capitalism you know Big Ideas waiting for a disasters to happen and I think we 've seen it over the experiment that has been that the Christchurch schools so I very much support this symposium and I 'm sure we will contribute a lot and I urge you to support this report well thank you rd on I just wanted to contribute and so that the big picture is where I think this will actually land and moving forward not just the little cementec Sabine what 's not going to be discussed and who 's going to be involved and what not but actually the big picture about Christchurch being the place where these lessons have actually been experienced in the first place and I think that 's what Christchurch needs to sort of you speak at a conference in Australia and Leanne 's spoken at a lot of them there 's global interest in how urban environments and the changing dynamics of disasters such as climate change or or just because people live in places that disasters are going to happen weather probably happen for centuries and millennia beforehand but one of the one of the things I really wanted to say is that through my own master 's research I came out with 14 research questions ten of them would have been perfect research questions for a PhD or some form of further research for what 's happened here in Christchurch and I think that all of the other research that I 've watched or seen coming out of Christchurch from the disaster has further research questions this is amazing testbed for actually where research can come from and one of the things I hope that would actually see from the symposium is actually how those can actually be transferred and actually baked in Christchurch the International place where where research can happen about you know disaster recovery or or what 's going of Christchurch being the place where anything is possible can you really consider boy officials they said it was a debate can you my question is can you write it for me no right so I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you _"

appear before the Select Committee and support of the council submission by videoconference if if it 's if they 're not if they 're not if they 're not coming to crush it you know so so I think we should yeah if required not yeah if required because I think you know we 're making a submission on zero carbon we 're not going to jump on a plane to go to Wellington to to deliver it so okay so move by Sarah and seconded by Pauline say so an amendment that they travel by electric car to the venue if it 's a bikers oh yeah that 's good I just um I just support strongly support this and I think it 's really good sensible approach sure yep so I strongly support or there 's some really good features in the submission I just wondered if in fact with the section given gonna we support increase in investment and public transport it 's only a page 502 even and if we should emphasize what the DHB told us just the other day that the huge amount of carbon emissions I think it 's something like two million tons a year just as what 's happening in Christchurch currently but also the the percentage of that that is due to transport emissions because that what they told I 'd always thought it was about 25 percent but they told us it was about 53 percent so I 'm just wondering an effect emphasize their aspect if we might add that in I am aware we 're ready to sign it off sorry what I 'm just it 's on page 502 yeah sorry which section is it on the questions the the 16 questions page 12 your safety 12 yeah thank you and what does that major cycle we 're about what I 'm remaking point is it could we emphasize how in fact the investment and public transport in in cycle ways is so really important to Christchurch given our current emissions wondered in fact in terms of the the the air commitments I 'm not quite sure but we added the support that this council gives to healthy homes that perhaps a line on that could be included in the spirit especially obvious and light of the the government 's support for those policies I might have missed it but we could add those two um I guess that 's not all right Sarah L Pauline often the counselor working through it absolutely so a key part of that was this addition some counselors to have that section we 're talking about now the additional information so to send that message through to government there 's a lot of good work going on and from counselor activities so that 's been added and and the other area of discussion was around accountability for government so we 've got the Commission being set up which is suggestion but also how can there be accountability appropriate accountability from what the Commission is reporting on through the three two governments that 's an interesting area and for them to discuss and the Select Committee think in summary also council having the ability to work closely with government on mitigation and adaptation were very keen as a council I don 't think that was coming through very strong and they 're in the discussion document so council has put their hand up as other councils I presume are very interested in this area and what to be fully involved with the government on Hey so wrapping up the debate Sarah yeah why did you want to speak sorry oh sorry okay yep yeah I just wanted to say that I 'm it 's really good to see that in point team that GDP may not be the best economic measure to indicate how New Zealand 's economy might might be measured in the future I think it 's a really good part of their submission that actually I think moving forward as a society we need to think about better measures on how we how we want me to measure growth for all of those kind of things in New Zealand and also just wanted to make the additional points the addressing the building code I think it 's a really good point to have in there as well because I think a lot of the time we talk about you know climate change in energy energy dependency and one of the biggest places we have energy dependency is around heating our homes and New Zealand has a very bad track record of that and very unhealthy homes in our society so I think that 's really good that that point is been noted as well good so I think it 's a really excellent submission I 'm really pleased with the amendments that you know we have proposed especially for example including social health expertise as part of the Commission those kind of things but also that they how their references that we are making to bringing communities along with us so because we know that in the future that in terms of adaptation that we as a city and their people are going to be part of it so I really commend those all the whole the whole submission but particularly Sarah is a City we have made our commitments so we 've 2030 and design the Global Covenant of Mayors into getting the Cassetti to a state we were in neutral by 2050 that 's not an easy task and I 've seen commentary in the media and sub with social media not the media they 're a bit more informed about us doing it too early and we only need to cut everything off at 2050 that just doesn 't work we need to have a transition we need to get started now but it 's not enough that we do it as a city we need that national legislation in place it 's a really pleased that we 've got a really strong submission here encouraging the CIN encouraging the highest standards and the highest mitigation possible because if we don 't mitigate the MPS will had a lot more adaption to do and there will be a lot more expensive for our communities thank you all right I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried _"

need to conclude a train your agreement setting out how they will work together on a regional basis over the three years until the next election and and and our agreement thus in Canterbury this is set out on the Canterbury local authorities tray in your agreement 2017 to nineteen it mandates the work of the Canterbury mayoral forum and a midterm review of progress against the agreement as attached to the report I 'm happy to respond to any short questions that you might have relation to those matter but I think it 's relatively straightforward so I will I will move that we receive the report and that will be seconded by Andrew okay and is there any questions Pauling 478 yes Pacifica trying agreement so continuing to implement they can 't_''_94.53 be one minute from its strategy so how does how does the so the the mayoral forum was the initiator of the set up under that so the zone committees are actually part of the Canterbury water management strategy for the zonies report no we have a lead from ECAM who reports on us and that changes over time so and I knew that you 'd ask me a question it would normally be the the chair of he can that would provide that regular reporting it 's always on the agenda of the mural forum and the because the previous chair of the mayoral forum was Dame Margaret bazi David Cagle as a commissioner used to provide that report and now one of the councillors of II can provides that report and I can 't remember her name off the top of my head so I can check for you but there 's a regular report and use for the three waters big was that was a specific commitment and the trainee agreement so at the beginning of the trial agreement we said we will investigate options for the delivery of three water services in Canterbury being very aware of the fact that central government we 're looking at it with were going into the section 17a review process that Christchurch City Council actually offered to do this work on behalf of the Canterbury mayoral forum and did commence that work it wasn 't conclusive and then we proceeded with our own work as part of our section 17 days which were referred to your committee great yep Sarah did you yes what knees up to the Regional Committee in the intern yeah but you don 't remember the name of the person from 1810 oh that 's terrible I 'm embarrassed but I 'll find out the name it 's one of the woman counselors clear yes please sue nomás okay Makai clear Makai so that 's who is providing that regular reporting through on the Canterbury water management strategy Jonnie thanks I just wanted if you had any information on what the I 'm on page 3 of 7 in page 480 which page 480 in our agenda it says that they 've got an improved productivity contract with central government with Christ returns it for 5 years of a million dollars so I just wanted if you had and whether that 's any funding additional that we need to well if it 's additional funding for crotchets and did that that includes the overheads saving us money it 's sorry I don 't hit that right in front of me at the moment ok I was just going to ensure that if there is a contact with government like we do with other programs that that budget does cover some of cryogens it 's over AIDS so that we 're not just continually funding the expansion no no no it 's not it 's not funding an expansion of Christchurch in said it 's actually funding work that appropriately sits with them and would have set with CDC you know it know thanks for that to happen but it would be good to kind of know that I 'm given that we 're funding crisis and did a huge operational funding that whatever contracts they signed with government did did include some of the corporate know I 'll have to check so we are a partnership with the government in this and it 's so important that we in C let 's just said prior to them CDC so nothing is fully funded by Council with regards to relationships with government and others so it 's a partnership and percentage-wise maybe we could just get some information including a budget and also just a kind of high level understanding of what the increasing productivity she is yeah yeah it 's part of the Canterbury regional economic development strategy it 's one of those strains we actually I was just going to touch on touch on something similar because I 'm page 483 being a local services and as a result of the meetings you 've had there 's nothing really around economic development or anything like that from the regional point of view and I think it 's really important that we actually do more in that area the Canterbury regional economic development strategy is a number of strains and each of the Mears takes a different lead I chair the mayoral forum but I 'm not the lead of any of those streams because those strands of work need to be supported in lead and I simply is that you have I believe who leads that passion so which one the economic development stuff no the the Canterbury regional economic development strategy has multiple strands and each strand has a different lead right so I will I will send it out again counselors have been provided with this information but I know that the influx of information that you receive as such that just pulling it out at any one time as a but as a bit difficult but the Canterbury regional economic development strategy did come through council so it was reported to Council but anyway I will provide that information this has taken a lot longer than I for me would we took out the irrigation yes no that was the that was this album The Canterbury economic development strategy crushed it yeah anyway I will put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried we 've got ten more minutes till morning cheese

working group of the commutation and also we agree then I Tahu as one of a key a strategical partner and also we already put on the outer circle group and also I write to tell his opportunity to highlight the fully pointer obvious the proposed review of the International Relations a policy 2013 and the sister cities strategy 2000 first one I would like to emphasize actually this the new proposed hand of the policy framework will be crucial strategic document for this city safe clean way in attend to the city this is also the International connection city then we will review the current list to our document one is the internet relation policy in 2013 the other one is a sister city strategy 2000 r2 in attitude review and also even review over Alaska three years the international relations landscape and environment you know in quite search has changed significantly particularly we consider a long-term plan council our meeting on 26th of June accounts of who adopt the strategic framework our long-term plan but this framework actually is highlighting our vision our community our outcome in our strategic priorities but we will review lost our palace the environment landscape we consider like a cottage NZ and also the development I just the limit as well as patch Antarctica office this over the last three years establishing and also they have a kosher responsibility for promote these strengthening international relations a sexual and also you will view over the last couple years a council in say most key stakeholders we establish the kind of approaches visitor strategy hydras multi-culture strategy accountable international education practical Cairo a strategy all these strategies will be more or less where a failure to our newly proposed order strategy so this way we the crucial know so this while we need to take a kind of holistic way all those strategic partners in working together so our working group no particular agree we need a refresh join the vision for engaging with the world to bring the maximum return back to our church but is the return now you can see my little international education students might be the tourism or Peace in a carnation hi radial investment or economic development or academic partnership etc so this way we were crucial for all of us but in here we would like to emphasize this is not only a high-level strategic document but we did have flirtier the workplane know where we prepared in line with this policy during the framework because we considered to setting out what we want to achieve and the wind will be the implement achieved and how we will measure our success so HLS a kind of practical action plan as well as the and a consists of a wide range and a kid group members except my fellow cancers but we did include the new Lake Tahoe or sister city the committee 's Airport MV New Zealand and the trader enterprise and purchase NZ and an accountable import chamber commerce etc and also wider group we also consider the current local multi the the a theory community and education in some other business group as well but in here I would like to emphasize the mayor I 'll mail you

strategical city so our mail is highly supportive of this process so hope you will be the way we were in a crucial and important and also these others the kind of policy the framework we include in the reader stages the first stage is a plane in the research second stage is sculpting in a writing stage third one is remaining in the approval stage all these aesthetic document we considered this

proposed framework to the council through the strategic capability committee with updates as necessary so if you 'd like to move that I 'd be happy to second listen to me okay there any questions are there any is there any debate down I just wanted to say one point I 'm and I 'm happy to see number six on there agree that mitre who 'd be recognized as a strategic partner because it wasn 't obviously in the original recommendations there and I just wanted to say that we are a country built on a a bicultural foundation that embraces a multicultural future so I just wanted to say that and

    "text": "thank you very much so now we move on to item 14 and that 's come from social community development and Housing Committee the Harry Potter reference group so I 'll hand over to Phil Clearwater I 'm happy councils I 'm happy to move this I think that in effect the reference group have been formed it 's taken some time to form this is what they have agreed on to the recommendations originally came from the committee and now really they 're asking for council to be signed off so in effect this reference group is being worked in collaboration with Council and I think that 's a very good way to for this group to to to work in the future clearly being proactive rather than addressing issues with hindsight in trying to patch them up afterwards so I want to thank staff a large amount of work that 's been done with a lot of the different groups and how well this has been pulled together and I commend the staff recommendations to you okay moved by hopefully water and seconded by Dan swags Sarah I a just a quick one what the the composition of the group I 'm just wondering if any consideration was given to the actual residence groups themselves that surround tepee park so like icon of those kind of things have taken part as reference group members for things like the bit of a spatial plan for the garden andrew is this your report okay come and come up to the table and I think that the questions probably best directed straight to staff yep thank you sorry do you mind repeating the question I 'm just wondering if um you know the residence groups like icon who were involved and say the Botanic Garden spatial plan were considered to be suitable for representation and their group there is reference in the reference and the terms of reference to local groups yeah not essentially to sit on the group but to be invited in to advice if there was a matter specific to having an impact on the neighborhood as opposed to some of the some of the things that this group has been set up to establish yeah you know go through a decision process and the group gets the opportunity to assist that how is it different so to the youth council age concern or they spoke in degree I mean sport can 't_''_168.51 agree on there but many of the things happen he 'd be Park and not to do with sports I wasn 't actually present at the first group do you recall discussion around look I can and I think one of the things is that clearly a group has to be workable there are limits to the numbers who might come they could be invited in the future I think in relation to the Botanic Gardens there speaked that that in fact is not included in a separate so this is about Hagley Park so there was a lot of consideration given to the makeup of the group and the group are also happy with what the hell this is certainly because neighborhood groups would certainly be welcome to come along to make the point of view I 'm just maybe considered that the neighborhood groups be invited at the time very carefully in the but to bring them in for specific items as required yeah so as long as the groups are aware that they can that the group exists and that if they could maybe they treats them to the group so meeting those neighborhood groups know that this group now exists and that they they might be invited at some stage in the future I 'm sure that through the community boards they should be advised and that 's very important you know I suppose it was partly my question as a in relation to you know how this would be you know sort of get a front facing you know it 's so you know they 're going to have a page on the council web page and the you know with with just an update on the meetings that they 're holding and advice that they 're giving you know I mean I just because if it 's going to be you know an opportunity to to create you know goodwill around the you know the collective benefit that their wisdom will bring to these issues you know it seems wondered we that are we actually formally establishing the group ourselves I mean is that is that what we 're doing because I just wonder whether we should receive the information report and that we should agree to establish the Hagley Park reference group I mean you could even take the wording out of purpose one as a sounding board for community views and preferences in relation to Hagley Park and adopt the terms of references attached you know Lopez you know I think as long as it 's workable my recollection is that in fact by way of a council decision the group was already established so now it is really signing off the terms of reference by z16 bakery normally we have the reference to the decision when it was established that 's not in front of us so are you saying that these prior resolution that I 'm not aware of my recollection is that there was a there 's been a number of resolutions calling for the group by council calling for the group I 'm just wondering if it 's actually been formally established on services unit have advised that for the group to take effect terms of reference will need to be adopted by the council so I just wonder whether we should just confirm the establishment of the Hagley Park reference group I 'm anti and adopt the terms of reference in that way we 've got a an actual clean record of the decision that we 've made yeah all right so just those words will do confirm the establishment of the Hagley Park reference group and adopt the terms of reference as attached and so when we do a record of this I 'm gonna the terms of reference should be published as well so that I mean that they 're here for the public to look at but who wants to go through a bunch of council agendas looking for it Jonnie and then I 've Dion then Andrew yeah so I did it to move an amendment in regards to the community board the names wrong so it needs to be the Longwood central ethnic community board but also it 's not an amendment that 's just a typo course race that the committee but it hadn 't been for say I 'll leave it in your capable hands and then just just picking on the point of ceremony actually well I usually do think it 's a bit of a gap not having the local reasons Association we have a resonance group policy and it actually does use to have I don 't know where it 's got to we 're reviewing it but local reasons groups are supposed to be contacted about local works in the area and given the history of that particular reasons group and others a long higly Park I can 't I can see the disadvantage of not having him there but I can 't see the advantage of sorry I can 't see the disadvantage that 's right I 'll try and put that more eloquently basically I can see an advantage to having him on this Grove and a huge disadvantage not having him on the group and so if the idea is to work together which particular one and what icons the one that comes to mind but there also neighborhood group in a city in a city West neighborhood group I come but there 's a long history of that group being Civic civically and civic participation around not nekron around things through through the area I mean they 've they 've you know gone to the Environment Court under previous iterations of our district plan they 've they 've been very active in terms of things like the museum redevelopment previously so I just personally do think it 's a really good point that 's serum oh and when you look at some of the other people that are on this great I mean some may have I don 't know we 're not giving speeches we 're asking questions in a city what is it a necessity to refer back to the wider group but I don 't fundamentally see a problem simply because whenever there is an item make a substance they could be invited anyway so can we would we normally invite them can we just have item for request that the Hagley part reference group consider like this inviting icons but but in a association to be a part of the reference group and and well it 's it 's up to them to decide whether isn 't it so what autumn authorize authorize the Hagley Park reference group to to include him in minutes up to them to the side so we have authorized them to include it okay um sorry there was Dion was next just in in page 3 6 9 and point 6 point 8 we we required members will maintain confidentiality to enable council to exercise of delegated authority so these meetings that are going to be happening they 're going to be public excluded or they 're going to be open style meetings we 're minutes we 'd be published and whatnot or will it be a combination about we 're working ahead on the basis that you know it 's all publicly discoverable but we 're required you know this was a catch-all we can 't prejudge as counsels position in some circumstances and I guess what we 're saying there too is that some of the applicants that might be coming in to discuss some sort because they 're not really to go through a consenting process for example okay so what the the point that I wanted to make there was you 've got a number of I mean it 's good that we 'll see them before happen but there are a lot of other neighborhood associations around that have an interest in Higley Park in the inner city and it 's not just on this side of the city it 's also record in as well in Eddington and what I 'm thinking is that would it be possible to actually publish the agenda items we 'll send an email to those residents associations at the time that these meetings would be happening and then also seen them a copy of the minutes because I know that it 's going to go to community development and Housing Committee for information if it 's publicly available it should be going to those residents associations who are interested and concerned I suppose is it possible to do that I mean this is exactly my point that I was getting at in terms of it being possible yes the point at six point eight concerns me that members will maintain confidence you know but I 'm just wondering if these will be front facing meetings or no no no these are the elements weird they 're not that they 'll be shared information about resource consent applications before they even go long absolutely financial invent regard but there will be obviously elements where it won 't but I think a newsletter or a front facing organization that 's accessible through our pages I think it 's a good idea the idea is for this to be inclusive and engaging it 's the complete opposite of the you know sort of the negative approach it 's a positive approach yeah so that that 's what we want it to be it 's very injuries taking notes so I 'm so happy I just want to make sure that there 's kind of happen that 's all yeah and Andrea thank you agreement with the terms of reference but I think there 's some tidying up that we could do these terms of reference of a perfect snapshot rather than saying the name of the Community Board could we not just say a community board representative or a community board member from the community board area which contains Hagley Park and when we 're detailing the chair of the appropriate committee could we not just say the chair or deputy chair of the committee which has Hagley Park within its terms of reference to avoid further work needing to be done to update these terms of reference in future councils or situations where those arrangement have changed and my other thought on that was for the sake of continuity we 've got a two-year refresh at the moment would it not make sense as we do with the reserve management committees to align them with the council triennial so that the committee was refreshed given that there are elected members on there at the beginning of each new council term just a thought had any of those things been considered if timeframes had been considered and really it was around it 's a big commitment for people you know there 's a lot goes on in Haley Park a bit of discussion at the last meeting around what is the appropriate and I guess that this is where we settled and that was a collective agreement with with essentially the core members of they wrote that a two-year discussion and refresh was appropriate yeah yeah no that 's that 's all good as long as it was considered if that was the outcome then that 's great it was essentially more about their volunteer memberships than councils systems yeah yeah no that 's fine but if there 's agreement just to picking up those changes in terms of reference I think that good yep fill in the in Pauline thank you Andrew could just remind me because my my recollection is that the terms of reference are around Hagley Park per se not the areas adjacent to it or the streets adjacent to it that 's the first question what that as a second part to their injuries clearly there being a lot of discussion about the different neighbor groups and I 'm just consider I 've got some concern that if we name one that in fact wigs that Pretz wit to be inclusive we should name me more all I 'm just sort of wondering what your opinion of a up there it is it 's a it 's been well discussed by the group that I just wonder at this stage to be inclusive if in practice we should say that the surrounding neighborhood associations to be inclusive I 'm just wondering about your thought on that sure well I guess my thoughts on the wider groups are we can certainly invite them and we can you know we can make joint there is a risk and this has been discussed at their meeting that it gets a bit unwieldy and of course of course the the group is there to support people with initiatives and that might include council on improvements or activities associated to igloo parks and that seems I guess the wider it is the better some groups have also suggested that they don 't necessarily want to go into that environment and beacon you know fully open because they might want to oppose some of those initiatives so you know all has been discussed and debated you know quite extensively and this is where as narrow as we have that group siedel I know I haven 't given you a year sore know but it 's it 's how big does the group get before it becomes ineffective remembering that its purpose is to provide advice to your committee and then on to counsel not to make any decisions it 's the sounding board I like that phrase you know I really do now Pauline and then Tammy was following on from there so would you hag Lee Park and Hagley Park is a metropolitan facilities and health policy so the my point is that if one residents association on one side was today surely we should cast the meet perhaps to pace the whole city to be feared well I don 't know that it 's a question of fairness it 's a question of contribution but I mean that 's the political that is the political debate it 's not really for a staff we 're asking questions right thank you I guess the two of sounding board is goes to over concerns with regards to Headley Park yes Queen and it 's and its balance and management and that type of thing so with Vince there are a huge amount that event organizers do to contact the neighbors with regards to pot the events coming up as sound and fix on traffic etc so the true purpose of this technically as those interest groups using the park or is it the wider community because I mean I 've heard noise complaints from the Brighton the airport if what I mean so what I totally understand the concern people have with regards to residents groups but there are certain people that will complain about everything so that 's not the purpose of the group the purpose I believe was that I understood was trying to get a balance and that the protection of the park is that correct the purpose of the group is essentially that sounding board so that is I guess everyone is fully aware if anything 's going to happen at all in Hagley Park it 's going it 's going to raise questions for many purpose of the group was to give them a forum where those concerns can be discussed I think the group 's already realized that they 're not going to agree on everything and it 's to enable staff to then present and a more proactive manner the viewpoints of of the community when initiatives associated heavy Park come up the grip is not going to try to resolve issues that may arise out of hosting events or anything like that it 's a proactive not a reactive Sarah yep all right well I shall open it up for debate then Yannick I think we need to just a very good thing about things that are Metropolitan and what that means because things that are metropolitan have an impact on a local area way more than other people in the city and so whether it 's qe2 which is definitely metropolitan but you know it 's it 's got huge working with the local community to come up with what 's done there which I welcome and support you takes places like the groins which are metropolitan regional parks these are to be involved so you know I think the strengths of us grow and you know I really welcome this I think this is long overdue the idea that we have a much more collaborative relationship with people that are impacted by what happens in Hagley Park is a really positive thing so that you know often often as as a local council representing that area you get the complaints and a lot of those complaints do come from people that live quite close to when events are on but what they don 't see is all the work that goes in from the event organizers to try and mitigate some of the problems and so the idea of working together I think just makes so much sense sharing information there will be gaps that come up from time to time and getting that local feedback as to what 's worked well what hasn 't worked well is really important so you know I don 't think we should be worried that because it 's a metropolitan asset that we 're involving a local group in fact I think it work really well part of doing that is to have the local people that live in the closest proximity on board with what 's happening so that we minimize the potential for disagreements or conflict and so that 's I was really supportive of their local residents associations and in this area being involved now appreciate they might not want to be and that that 's right I think that 's a call that they could make but I think we should certainly send extend the invitation I have to say I think in the past they have actually worked collaboratively really well with Council the victorious clear I think was a really good example so you know I think there is sorry the Botanic Gardens spatial plan as well so when they got the opportunity to work with us I think we 're seeing nothing but positive results rather than negative so that 's why I 'm really supportive of this and supportive of that amendment Hamilton thank you I 'm really pleased at 6.8 is in this I think that some of these groups work getting it forward through it would be really good as it heats up I think the confidentiality is really clever and really important because obviously there 's a point be a surprise remember there 's a wee bit of trickery in the events game so you always want to keep a hit so that 's always confidential that once mentioned you know we go through a lot say we 're you I 've done it for a while there the information that goes out to the local communities around Hagley Park you know hand-delivering information with regards to what 's been agreed to affected areas by council as the owner of the asset to handle over to properties the traffic our changes and the times and the noise and the possible issues it 's a huge amount of work and so the information that goes out from those organizer as as a huge amount so those community residence groups actually get a lot of information I think that one of the reasons that this was brought up as this group was the concern of overuse of Hagley Park and I think we have classes the red zone which is around the Barbados Fitzgerald kilmore that even loop to maybe take some pressure off Hagley Park with a second Central City Park because everybody wants to do something in the Central City I think that there is something that we should kind of look at as a council and councillors to see if this some way we can take the pressure off but I really this is a great document and it 's a really good way forward there will be I 'm sure teething issues but and it 's the same with everything but I think this is actually outstanding and thank you very much for the work injury in the committee thank you I 've got Andrew Sarah so Oh clean bowled I mean so you 're gonna wrap up because you 're the fun one and I want to say a couple of things as well Andrew I 'm hugely supportive of this I think it 's a big move in the right direction um I realized this has taken some time to put together but I think it 's important it and and doing it sooner if it took this time to to get it right I was certainly involved in some of the early discussions about this as the chair of the relevant committee at that time I also think it 's right that we acknowledge the people who will be sitting on this body clearly as has been pointed out it 's a voluntary role and I think we 're very fortunate to have people in the city were willing to give over their time so that we get the best outcomes for Hagley Park and and totally appreciate that and I would just make the point we 've got resolution three they 're noting the correction of the community board name central Lynwood central Heath Kearns if we pick up those suggestions that I made earlier in my question resolution three then in fact becomes redundant because we wouldn 't be naming the community board we would just be picking up the community board with Hadley Park in its geographic area Sarah thank you I 'm really really pleased to see the inclusion of number four here be part of the group while ideally you know is pouring see we 'd have more residents groups involved from from around the city or maybe around the other sections of the park I also agree with the committee chair that having too many groups would be unwieldy and so having one residence group this one in particular who have had a have a long history of being positively involved with interaction with the park is part of the sounding board I think is a really good way to ensure resident representation around the table around what is such an important which part and I see things we could glean although number four a note the acting chair of icons already has by virtue of the Civic trust group a place at the table so I think this happens because we have a small city but yeah I 'm pretty relaxed about this and you know keep it going Erin this might be a little premature but dear we say it as this hands-on Hagley here it goes well I 'll just say a couple of words and then I also very pleased to see this happening I think I recall had got hands-off Higley coming to the council making submissions and I recall was having a very good conversation with them about you know their desire to contribute to the preservation and you know ongoing well the ongoing preservation of Hagley Park for the good of the people of Christchurch and it certainly does deliver that and and that the phrase hands-off Hagley was was almost a barrier to the to what they were trying to achieve and they are going to be very much a part of the reference group and and I know that we all really wanted to to send the the message that we want to do this together so I 'm extremely pleased I 'd like to congratulate the the committee for getting this through and in coming up with these terms of reference I think that it is important to have the Neighborhood Association that is the most closely associated with heavy Park and I think Yanni raised some very good points about how they 've got involved in the and the process Park so I think that 's ideal in that regard so but I do agree with injury that the size the size has got to be kept manageable and so that it actually can be the sounding board that it 's being established to be so gratulations to the team for getting it together and I 'll hand over to Phil to wrap up the debate thank you well Thank You Lian in councilors and again to Andrew like turning things around has taken some time but and I think though it 's it 's moving from we you know the history hasn 't always been easy and then we might have been some good decisions made to actually ensure that the relevant groups are involved and engaged and work with their counsel and so I think you know collaborating together that would come rolls easily off the tongue but in fact pulling it together and actually making it work always as harder and as has been I think Tim referred to some teething problems yep they 'll happen yet but I but there 's a lot of goodwill among local Neighborhood Association they 're involved because and clearly within the terms of reference the other neighborhood groups would camp would come along as well if they had a particular interest so it is an inclusive group it is overall representative and I 've got every confidence that in fact this group will work very well in the future all right so I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much thank you Andrew _"

    "text": "open papers the items 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 and they really are grouped in relation to a range of bylaws so I 'm going to now hand over to the chair of regulatory performance and if David if you could give us an overview of all of the bylaw papers that we 're going to be considering because I think that might assist the understanding of what we 're doing at the meeting this morning thank you thank you then we had before us laws that are up for a review and it is something that I would stress at this stage that they all have undergone what we call a section 1 5 5 analysis which reviews line by line the various clauses in each of these bylaws and determines in the end whether or not a bylaw needs to be reviewed and if so ultimately recommends a special consultative process to do so so we have a number of these items before us and I do stress the significance that we are not actually approving these bylaws for adoption today we are merely recommending that come back to the committee later in the year for approval or recommendation I should say for approval and time to be adopted some of them for a specific reason during the year so the first one is the freedom camping bylaw which really is being amended to prohibit all freedom camping by law in the whole of the akoroa Township apart from a specific area and returned and secondly that the proposed changes would prohibit all freedom camping on the whole of except for sorry one area where self-contained vehicles continue to camp for up to two nights and secondly that the there is a limitation on overnight parking in any freedom camping area to one vehicle per mark space so we are just tidying up two things in the echo our area one to restrict the area down further and two to say that in this area there are a number of mark spaces and one vehicle per space the second vial or is the alcohol in public places by law which there are a number of changes and specifically we are making including two new band areas prior to this meeting were actually now only making changes to two of them so for the bulk of the alcohol the three areas in Christchurch there are no change the Rickett and race course area we are proposing to make the ban on cap date permanent similarly with the Lynwood village area the Rickett and eylem area we are proposing to extend the current ban area to cover the island primary school and in jelly park the proposal is to extend the band area to cover the adjoining roads on either side of jelly pack the Eddington proposal has we were recommending today that we we just retain the current cup day provision of 00 a.m. to TP 00 p.m. on the day of cup day and the issue of extending the band I 'm in the Eddington area will be further reviewed and come back to the committee at a later date there are two other areas that we are considering or or in relation to large-scale events which in a will and they enable the chief executive to approve a temporary ban for large-scale events in two domain and Thompson Park in the New Brighton area so there is the the changes for the alcohol in public places Paul or the public places bylaw significant changes in that one requirement to display street numbering in all commercial buildings new clause for silage and an event in public places and we are removing the requirements for buskers to have a license and there will be a new cold code of conduct imposed under the policy and will also provide for a code of conduct for speakers corner there the two major significant changes to public and places by law trading and events [Music] brothel signage this wire loss pebbles is really just to restrict the location of brothels and control signage that advertise commercial and sexual services there are only some minor changes there is a new section on small owner operated brothels to be added to make the requirements easy to understand and including how they relate to the district plan and home occupied operations and the boy law does contain maps where brothels are allowed so there 's only minor changes to that and it must influence at all on the street based sex worker issue cemeteries boy law minor changes and we are also looking at the cemeteries handbook an update in that so I go back to my earlier comment that these are all boy laws that under review we 've done a section 1 5 5 on them they will go out for public consultation they will come back to the regulatory performance committee for a recommendation before they come back to this council for final approval it 's very helpful David so just in terms of the because I 'm sort of kind of over mind that these could be dealt with her than a single resolution and but just highlighting that that some changes to the by law in relation to Eddington alcohol ban area specifically going back to the 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. on you sealant rotting cup day with the reference I don 't know whether we actually yes and then item 7 requested after discussed with the sprayed in Kashmir community board the possibility of a 7 alcohol ban area prone all year round and Eddington would discussions with a bylaw or amendment if applicable so and it just puts that one eschew that was drawn to our attention back into the back into the mix so it doesn 't take it off the agenda all together but it takes the agenda for today happy to move that they be taken as a block yep seconded by Phil Clearwater so is there any discussion Andrew just very briefly I 'm hugely supportive of the the amendments to the freedom camping bylaw going out for consultation this response to some serious concerns from the akaroa community particularly over the last summer season but in previous summer seasons as well I think restricting the the area where freedom camping can occur in a Corral is certainly a sensible proposal and really reflects those community concerns and I just like to thank staff and the committee for the speed at which we 've been able to respond to the information coming out of the community in the hope that we can get something in place for the upcoming summer season so thanks to the committee and for staff involved in process and looking forward to the outcome through the hearings panels I 'm sure they will be across the details such as this on page one six nine over event organizers now needing a permit this will be on top of traffic safety management plans if my reading is correct and I have a concern over you know it cost on them when some of those event organizers run on the smell of an oily rag so I will be curious and following that one to see how it tracks along but happy for this to be put through to the hearing pills Jonnie had several questions when I just wanted to check one of those questions when doing okay you just want to get to debate okay good regards to the freedom camping one of the concerns and what we saw last time is when we ban it in certain areas it just pops up somewhere else and then we don 't have the resources to address it so I 'm a little bit concerned and obviously will welcome the community feedback on it so you know I guess do need to think about what resources we 're going to allocate to it rather than you know what happened last time where we didn 't have the resources we didn 't have the places and I think we saw a pretty unsatisfactory results so I look forward to that I think it would be good actually the cemetery 's 1 is quite useful and that has diagrams explaining sort of measurements there 's a number of other things and these other bylaws that don 't quite have the same degree of detail so particularly things like the public places by law the the placement of science for example or overhanging vegetation and so it 's still a little bit of a gray area so again I think where we can get some clarity around how we can take action against these Bibles with diagrams that show kind of expected width or measurement might might be quite helpful and I think the symmetries one does that well I would just say that the other concern in regards to the alcohol then bylaws as there 's comment in the report that open 7 but yet the committee has an extended in the Central City to cover an area an operation of 7 fast food and I can 't quite understand if that 's the evidence that you 've got why you haven 't taken what would be a pretty logical step so given that we cut house creatures I 'll just raise that as a concern but obviously we 'll wait and see what submissions come in in that regard thank you bring up a point which my colleague over to my right brought up event organizers in the city actually required to do a lot of things that required to have insurances public liability they are actually if you 're going to do an event that affects the road you are required to do a hell of a lot and I notice that here on this page 17 around page 169 that covers large events as well as small events such as sweet parts street parties and neighborhood events I wouldn 't suggest that there would be very few neighborhoods or streets or native through neighborhood week actually now afford street for a scripted street party so I think that if we 're going to add or streamline this process that we really do talk with this industry very carefully because we want to get it right there 's no reason to have a permit for permits sake and so I would really like to see some feedback from the organizations that do this work Thank You Erin yeah this in recent years has been a lot of discussion around some of the council bylaws and in the public domain and their application of them that we can solve or attack some problems ie freedom campus and move them on just end like the only said move into another spot yeah other issues and major ones in the city don 't get addressed because they get put in the too hard basket like the street prostitution where there might be outside a child 's bedroom well ten feet away or nuisance and aggressive begging outside a hotel a hundred meters from here that has people camping outside it with his fights and stuff where they 're trying to run a with bringing in by laws and rules which are really anti business so it 's it 's odd what kind of a council we are at times with some of our rules when we 'll go after the easy stuff and we 'll leave the hard stuff and this should be a consideration as we go through this process anyone else I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye all right those opposed say no that 's carried _"

    "text": "right the next item on the agenda is so this this past month obviously was was a busy month and but I just wanted to sort of highlight a couple of things one was international choreographer Cory Baker who for his birthday decided to set up a scholarship to assist financially challenged dancers achieve their dream as he had been supported and assisted I didn 't mention former mayor Vicky buck and in the commentary there because he told the story on the night that he made the announcement that it would it was the free events in the park that gave him the desire the burning desire and ambition to become a dancer and you know we sometimes forget and his mother 's an absolute rock star in her own right she was on her own and she supported him and the fact that they managed to you know scrimp and save and fundraise and get him to Australia and then just a sheer good fortune with a with a with a patron and a sponsor he was able to launch an international career so I just think that well the Heritage Awards our team has done really well with a number of the heritage projects and I did attend a heritage workshop which staff put on was attended by quite a collective group of out in the community interesting group of speakers but theirs obviously going to be some really good stuff brought forward I know the ear counselor Clearwater was was there at the same time and it was it was really worthwhile I mentioned a few other things I did last week and thank you to counselor Turner for taking over the meeting last week I went to China to support the import company with the they 're flying in formation cured or south which brings all of the RTOS from the South Island together I know that people think that it 's you know sort of kind of spawning off but I have to say leaving at 30 on Wednesday night in arriving home on at 30 on Sunday afternoon isn 't a sort of a dream trip but the advantage of taking a mirror to China is that you do get the president of was very pleased to support the airport company they 've been doing a fantastic job for a for our city so I 'm happy to take any questions a little Rison 's association and i see that the local MP amy adams was there who i think was the minister responsible for at least some of our district plan and i think she was also trying to get legislation changed so I just wasn 't quite sure what the next step is for us as a as a City Council in terms of what we can do I 'd certainly welcome just having some idea of what we can do yeah because I think it is really important and just to highlight in that context there 's been other industrial type activities adjacent to residential which are creating problems like Garland 's Road middle scope dealers which are bored there 'll be some information coming to Council in due course but it does raise that whole question of the appropriate buffers ya know it does raise that issue look thank you for raising their no I won 't_''_263.85 I won very good question the meeting has highlighted a number of issues and as a result Christchurch City Selwyn district in in Canterbury dhb any can have all Britain a joint letter to the Minister for the environment asking for New Zealand specific standards for buffers between residential properties inquiries and that 's a good thing the MP consent has written to us and to the inter ek and Selwyn district council following on from the meeting saying that she supports the 500-meter buffer between the the kind of quarries that we have here in Canterbury and in residential properties and asking us to amend our district plans in accordance with what that and obviously for the II can it 's the regional policy statement we 've heard from me Ken today and so I can update you right now that it can want to sort of kick up kick off the response to that letter because of course they 're responsible for the regional policy statement and that will be going through a it 's sort of process sometime over the next couple of years selwyn District Council has started ten year process and of course we know that we can 't change our district plan at the moment and Amy Adams knows that as well I have as you know written to the minister about it I 've actually just received a letter from the minister saying that she 's now consulting with the strategic partners under the legislation about our request in order to give us back the right to do that but it 's a process I know it 's but it 's the process under the Act so she 's triggered the process under the Act which is a good thing but what Amy Adams I don 't think he 's fully appreciated is that the wording of the order and Council which this was signed off by here as a former role as the Minister for the environment and by the Honorable Gerry Brownlee as Minister for earthquake recovery so that joint order and count jointly signed order and council has now been incorporated into the body of our statement of expectations and the actual I mean certain the strategic directions chapter of the district know that council your hands in your fully appreciative of how that needs to change as well so we 've got some work to do but we 'll be responding to here and the whole issue about setbacks is something that we do want to take some you know we do want to move on it there 's an activity the environmental effects are dust and probably noise and other things yeah dusters that it was a cane syrup well there 's some of it 's a cane door because that 's the up because the effects of other activities without buffers almost quite similar in terms of the dust impact on communities so I just I 'll leave it with you guys but I think it 's some surgery would be good for us to get briefed on that yeah no I think that 's a good idea all right would someone like to move that the report be received Andrew seconded by Jimmy I 'll put that motion oh sorry and it was raised about having a recess committee so I 've suggested that the recess committee comprising be here and a minimum of any three counselors Cora Merrill cancel back on three councils to be authorized to make any urgent decisions so that 's just a that 's required to be and that any meeting of the recess committee will be publicized and forward at all cancers so I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried _"

    "text": "you can hear from my voice those of you who can hear my voice will hear that I 'm not 100% so but I 've staggered back on in order to present my own meds report but before we get to that item can I ask you to turn your attention back to item 18 on the agenda and I 'd like to invite staff to come to the table this was the decision that you made earlier in the meeting to amend the speed limit on here Wood Road east of Johns Road 250 kilometres an hour and that 's you know extending in an easterly direction to its interstate yeah it was originally to be 60 meters to warm Woolridge Road and but you 've seen it from 50 kilometers an hour from John 's Road which does go against the advice of both staff and NZTA but he would school sort of kind of sittin at that little block there so what I want to do is to invite our staff member Steve is that to describe to us what the issue is and and then I take a 75% majority to change the resolution and I 'd have to say that from my perspective and not having been a party to the original debate it would it would take a pretty strong case to want to see that speed retained at 60 by a school so over to you sorry so in the original report there were other staff giving advice around capsule staff position yes oh no there 's been a I think can we just allow Steve to present the issue that he has brought to my attention thank you thank you first of all I apologize it was a misunderstanding of staff and agreeing with the board recommendation so apologize for taking up this time look and when our recommendation went to the community board for the whole he would area one to be sixty kilometers an hour except for that little bit west of the state highway we had assistant in accordance with this sitting of speed limits rule and with the documentation of NZTA we are required to take into consideration the views of the community following consultation so following the attending the board meeting look they wanted it reduced to 50 we reassessed it we reassessed it and it still the view of staff that because the school is located in a school crossing point only 200 meters from the state highway which is 80 kilometers an hour I know there 's a roundabout there and vehicles come around that the school has stated and when they presented to the board that vehicles were still speeding through the school speed zone so the school speed zone drops to 40 school entry and exit times we 're concerned that being 200 meters that often when you drop something and in this case it 's that will be from the present 30 kilometers an hour you get a reaction that people think that 's ridiculous I ignore it so sometimes when you lower a speed and you don 't learn as much you get more compliance the the it documents NZTA recommend 60 kilometers now for this area and so we bring that back it 's still the recommendation of the staff that this whole hearing here would area one should be Tim so we 've got a hierarchy of pedestrians first etc and as I understand it now a requirement with regards to safety so although you know the recommendations 60 Kay 's now there 's a school area I mean and and knowing from my experience and my community where we have Wilson 's Road that traveling south and you turn lived on distant to us road cars don 't slow down there and that 's a issue a real issue for the skull so I can imagine them coming around the corner so if we make it 50 at least there is an ability of wanting to enforce it they can took it people yes it may be three it 's great ten that sitting with speed limits it 's there is a look there is a a sense that you have to see something that the road speaks fifty quite frankly here Woods Road at that location doesn 't actually it 's got intimate housing and things on the south side but not on the north it doesn 't speak sixty and a strange example is when we we got better compliance of speed so there are those issues where you see the speed that that people are expecting in the road states by the way it looks that they will comply with that speed again we just do believe 30 kilometer drop from 80 to 50 is probably asking a bit much in that location and it would put it like you said when they came to us look they 're not obeying the speed here it would be look you 'd have to see the police because it 's a arterial road we 're not going to put calming on it but saying that in the future as your where there is a proposal for that the major cycle route go down that way that could completely change the nature of that road and it could be revisited at that time and it would likely be revisited 16 you got more compliance is it because the people that were doing 55 case or whatever was suddenly under the speed limit but they were actually doing higher than that so the the 85th percentile speed was higher down so there are weird things like that when sitting at speeds that you don 't expect it has to be something that people expect and the road speaks the speed Jamie and then Sarah and it does my scene stick so I appreciate that but just to help me get a bit more understanding around this what are indeed TA guidelines may deem that the appropriate speed limit for this road is 60 Kay 's is there any precedence or as far as a council do we often differ from there like I just think of like even be Li EV or Harper is Jamie we we often differ and I think the new setting of speeds has made it much easier for council to set speed limits here is like the causeway where we often have a speeding issue and it 's currently at 50 and it makes sense to be 50 but you get to the raising the speed now I 've noticed with the the current raised speed limit on Port Hills no power roads athena brahmam the DTA raised it from 50 to 60 recently just wondering the time difference so there are a lot of people who are still traveling at around the 55 kmac they used to traveling at 55 in because I 've been doing it forever that 's what they 're kind of sitting currently that used to be speeding and now it 's under the speed limit but I 'm seeing over time people are gradually raising that up and that sort of greatly over time doing the 6065 and I 'm wondering if the initial assessment on the other one was actually quite soon after the change and I 'm wondering what it would be like a year or two down the track the compliance through the chair let 's referred to what they 're doing now is the operating speed I 'd be surprised if they went sixty five but that would only be we would have to put tubes out and find out what was happening but when is ETA changed the setting of speed limits rule to make it easier they had did a lot of work in the background and in some cases they have them it would be unheard of for us to get 40k speed limits in life was possible warning in the past but in some roads like arterial roads dual Lane arterial roads they may be better to be at sixteen Yani just just want to be clear because we were I thought it was quite obvious and the of the debate special question that staff said that they 'd looked at the community board resolutions that they were now in support of them and you 're the staff made a mistake you just heard Steve say that right at the very beginning the earlier advice that you received is not the staff advice that 's why Steve 's asked to come so if we 're going to have a question around who said what said you received earlier advice that wasn 't the advice of staff staff have now come to correct us so we 're just going to move on from there and we 're going to get to the point where we understand whether we are an agreement to change or whether we want to stay with the to understand what the difference and stuff advise us is it purely based on the safety aspects thank you strong apologize because we just had we we we did not realize at the time that we were we believed that it was only for the speaking with nzt about the times of operation of the school speed zone the board recommendation changed it from 60 to 50 okay so but just in terms of the advice then it 's purely just focused on the safety of driver behavior is is what 's concerning you the most and you 've you 've said that part of it as the design of the road which encourages a certain speed are we if we wanted to reduce it to 50 are we able to put on some calming or change some of the configuration of the road with some some things that might the nature as I said previously the nature of the road may change depending on the design if the cycle route does go down that way but at the present time it is an arterial road it 's taking traffic side when you come into it I assist it twice and I don 't believe it says that it 's a 50 climate in our Road compare it to your local Road you drive and live in it 's not the same environment so look I wasn 't present for the meeting this morning so I would abstain I think it would only be fear that I don 't participate in the vote but it does anyone want to move the the recommendation that we returned to the 60 Kay 's Dion doesn 't someone want to stick in there David so I mean I 'll just put the motion because we need a 75% majority in order to make a change so given that we 've heard that their concern is about lowering it might actually increase it or not reduce speed as much whether there could be like a review period where we actually review what is actually happening in terms of speed once the limits changed and then review it okay see so what sort of period would you think look we could do it with our be set to 60 kilometers per hour with what they view with a review to be concluded within within six months and as a matter of process will that come back to committee your council through community board to be there to your council I get all the guys in there sound sensible yep so yeah okay with is that enough to cover it off yes ma 'am all right so I 'll put that motion yeah Aaron if we 're willing to review it in six months why wouldn 't we try the opposite go for the 15 if that 's not working and we 're getting the problems of when I live but maybe you for sure as a motion then yeah this aligns to start advice but if you want to do that you can for share to the motion 15 I would suggest it would be better the other way it 's like our 30k in the central city the operating speeds about forty three very hard to get it back and we may have got better compliance if it was 40 because the other thing cycling underpasses at the end of the street would more people be biking on healed road as it as if it was 50k currently it 's 70 for half of it yeah and that 's what we 'll be dropping to 60 or 50 depending on today 's decision yeah I think that that the result may have been different this morning of this advice had been available at the time Andrew and then Sara yeah I mean from my point of view the community board made their recommendation which we took this morning okay there 's been new advice provided now but I 'm assuming the advice that we 've been provided now was provided to the community board or was able to be provided to community board to give them the same level of comfort I 'm inclined to stay with the original community board recommendation yes just checking there are still quite a number of vehicle instances well the road itself is long and straight and there 's nothing there 's still a quite a number of vehicle entrances and exits along the stretch of roads some visitors and those kind of things during the day and one of the things that we 've been told with the ETA Road Port Hills Road was that the reason we nap 260 is that that actually distanced themselves from the residential and they had you know that widened it that created a completely separate street so that they weren 't the vehicle entrances and exits and otherwise even though it was straight they would have kept it 250 someone who had that place and a while the road is designed for the aunt we have a lot of there 's still a lot of big Lincoln 's and only a footpath on one side of the road yeah there is but there is memorial over 60 so there 's having having the number of various ways we 're not if it was we 're talking about 80 agreed wouldn 't there 'd be too many but for 60 it is an urban speed limit more reliable so here 's the trees as a comment we told the vertical elements and in the separation between two lanes just toys arms 've got a 50 at one end and a 50 or the other and this random piece in the middle so it 's what we 're trying to do is make it easier for the motorists not to be confused by continual changing of speed we have to try and set the speed limits so they the roads speaking what they say we had to argue to get that 250 with ends in ta because it was either way and we 're not allowed to use 70 anymore we 're not recommended it was 70 when we yeah yes so they 're trying to get rid of all seventies is it still 17 well it 's being resolved this morning as 50 all right okay so and that was mainly because we tried to tidy up that area yeah and now it 's 50 between outside Willowbank between those two existing 50k areas yeah you 're talking get back gardeners right but on that example from NZTA about coming off the 80k and going into 50 we 've resolved that if you go west into here would at the business should right there where there are no children there 's no preschools there 's no kindergartens there 's no primary school and these kids don 't cross and we 're gonna give them confident adult drivers 50k an hour and on the other side of the road where all the kids are in two churches it 'll be 60 that 's off the same rise another very good point and it comes back to that you can when you see the speed limit you must have certain lengths the road that is was an anomaly when the NZTA did up the highway that it was left over and no one so that was basically fixing anomaly it couldn 't be 80 so it had to go 50 because Orchard Road so the length of that little bit of here wood road is not long enough to have a secret speed so if we with the recommendation we 'd have the 60 on here word leading into Watson 's in the 60 on my my career day and then we 'd have it 's short a little bit of Watson 's caddying era that Watson 's will all be 50 but but if we keep it just keeps it all consistent it 's very narrow what 's is very narrow it 's totally different thank you very much and I really appreciate you doing that it 's not easy to come down and explain that perhaps some advice that we 'd received earlier hadn 't been the correct advice for us to consider seems to me that you know I really heard what you said when you said we might have got better compliance if the central city had been set at 40 and I think you 're probably right so and and sometimes these traffic things are counterintuitive but I 'm not going to participate in the vote cuz I wasn 't here for the full debate so I will put the motion all those in favor say aye well actually let me put up your hands because it 's easier that way those in favor put up your hands 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 it 's lost so sorry you did a good job thank you hey full share of motion that we do the 50 but with a review and second can we do every solution for a review in the staff and since it 's gone this way round and the council off the area more than happy to leave it this way round with the review in six months because if it 's not working yeah so are you happy to do a review within the six months so if we could just go back to the original resolution that we we still need understanding order nineteen point five amend resolution 5 so this yeah the what the reviews be completed within six months all right so that 's that 's called good now who would like to move there Aaron you wanted to move that and seeking to buy Jamie I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no there 's Karen thank you very much thank you _"

questions for Carlene Yanni thank you regards to the temporary chlorination and the work that we 're doing I just wondering there 's no I didn 't see in the report any mention of the review that we asked to be done so can we just get a time frame of when that 's coming back thank you thanks you report Kelly just the the section on future of heritage I besides and it 's included in the Me 's report too because she was there as well but I also attended one of those workshops and they were as you indicate excellent and certainly like a lot there 's a lot more clearly as your report indicates to the the funding we grant as well as the whole people part of heritage especially because of the night our home component I was just really going to ask if if aspects of this report thank you any further questions for Carlene Jimmy can 't come ass dude I just want to know because before I was told on the engineers do that kind of parties in commerce or university university yeah so we 're looking there 's a major employer in the city about where we can support education training development internships so be arranged across a range of areas from high school students all the way through so the universities open to a range of options for instance not just Commerce and engineering but management planning you know a range of options that we 've got and takes a bit of work but we 're really supportive of any kind of relevant policy no it 's really just the way that we work in the organization we have up we have a process around it rather than a policy or regulation thank you Mike I just in this mats that is you 've got a picture there of the the news cycle counter which was taken exactly one month ago mmm today exactly today it 's just took over 50,000 troops excellent thanks the report on page two five five about the Botanic Gardens thank you we got there in the end okay and and then back to Yanni it 's really great reading positive um New Zealand sign language we just I 'm not sure we get to an tunes of discussions about hearing a signer and counsel in as they 're a possibility to going forward um I haven 't followed up on that but I could do that do you think that would be great thank you great thanks Carly Yanni and link Glenn yeah I just wanted to check on the earthquake recovery symposium where the weakened two refunding and if so what budget that 's coming out of so we 'll be bringing you next week that 's right around it and around the way that will be made so essentially we 've been doing a lot of work in terms of giving your own time to figure this out and work with running workshops there will be some resource required in terms of venue which that the University of Canterbury so it 's not expensive but supporting budgets that we would run for engagement and strategy and policy in those sorts of areas so because it 'll provide good information and to the ongoing that we hear the government is still looking for or continue to look for sponsorships was an agreement that we had and there will be a decision about whether people will pay a fee to sorry so what was what 's been widely quoted is if you like the a budget that is expected to be used but it 's unlikely that all of it will be used the idea is that we 're half funding it with central government yes they 're doing symposium and that will come to us next week for a decision we this is the symposium that was going to be held last year is now being held this year thank you clean thank you just under engagement there and in light of the recent surveys over accessibility to decision making and this is not a criticism or anything but you know I 'm concerned over not so much moving into public excluded but how at times lately protect the private sector it seems to be coming at it the councillors expense and you know I we can in terms of the recent survey I 'm putting together a plan about how to address there and as you write quite rightly say the making of decisions and the information about decisions there 's something there people particularly concerned about and so I think there 's a range of things that we can do including making sure that the reports that we do have more usable in reader friendly that we engage early around some things even before decisions are made and it might be controversial that wind something 's in two PS we need to be clear about why does and we do have a lot of discussions and public excluded that do have an important commercial issue around them which we need to be careful about and we need to have a conversation with those contractors or whoever involved to make sure that they are aware about when we can release those things so it 's a better engagement around there and then about it might be detail of some of it those reports but also being clear around when we can release information and so as part of those reports in that you sign off on will be you know an expectation net within you know a few weeks or a week or twelve months or whatever does want something 's happened then we can release that I think it 's been just about crisper about that yeah yeah I don 't know their reviews on this obviously you know I struggled but kept low accelleration fun taxpayer money with rate payer implications but it seems we won 't be able to discuss that publicly and it would be great if could we find a way to there 's nothing to actually discuss or report at this point so once we there 's a process in place and we have an understanding of how we engage in that process then you know you can have those conversations and we 'll have a big understanding what parameters around that so but but we need we need to have those decisions first before we thank you alright so the report do I have a seconder TIMSS kandra 's all those in favor say aye against that 's carried now we 're at 29 minutes past 00 we 'd indicated that what we would do would be to take a lunch break between 30 and 3 o 'clock and then come back and complete the rest of the agenda now we 've got the mayor 's monthly report and some resolutions around a recess committee to go the strategy and policy for woodwork program which I suspect we 'll end up getting referred to a workshop that would allow us to completely open agenda probably quite quickly I would say but I don 't think that the PX item is necessarily going to be quite so fast just given what I 've seen coming through on the email so if I was to suggest that we adjourn for lunch as planned and come back at three o 'clock to complete the rest of the agenda that would be aligned with what we said we were going to do I 'm not hearing any massive push back against that all adjourn we 'll come back for those two final open agenda items at three o 'clock then we 'll move into public excluded all right so adjourned until three o 'clock thank you _"

    "text": "item 20 road stopping application for Jubilee Street we 'll take the reporters rate of any comments that staff wanted to make any questions on this one do we have a mover Sarah Templeton seconder dealing swigs Yanni I just recorded against number one and just to quickly speak to it this has been going on for a number of years and it 's my my view and I expressed this at the community board that actually retaining the link strip that allowing a license to occupy for access with conditions is a better way forward then just refusing access I personally don 't think that there 's significant safety concerns if you think if you look at the map you can see that actually where the long driveway comes out on to the other Street on to Bedford Street that 's directly adjacent to where heavy vehicles are actually entering and turning it into rather than a long with street where you don 't necessarily have that same movement so in my view the the leaders that we had and the submissions that were made in terms of sorry that actually it would have been relatively little impact of allowing controlled access particularly in light of the fact that this issue has been going on for a number of years extensive cost to council so I just wanted to outline why be voting against one and just make that clear thank you David least instance to have a long association with issues on this particular Street and in fact I think you know I think it 's fair to say that this issue been going on for something like 16 years and one particular person has invested a large amount of money where at times the community board were in favor and staff weren 't and it 's flip-flopped all over the show and I think we have spent well in excess of a hundred thousand dollars of staff time and resources on the sale or access of a piece of road that probably would have netted council somewhere in the vicinity of 30,000 absolutely maximum so I would I would actually like to probably be proposing an amendment along the lines of yeah and he suggested to one piece of land there are other issues with other landowners and this little piece of Street that have not yet been resolved and arguments about how we allowed access on the other side of the road to a an industrial usage there and in fact in the note the historic asyou down below there were suggestions that this particular person shifties access from Jubilee Street directly onto Rutherford the whole thing has been an absolute can of worms for 16 years and I think a sensible resolution would be to allow license to occupy and access over this particular strip of land okay so can I get some wording for the amendment please I think it 's probably because that 's a direct opposite to what the substantive one is for shattering emotion maybe better than moving an amendment happy to seek the advice from staff well I mean it 's up to whoever wants to move an amendment either to move one or not moving amendment to do a direct opposite of a resolution it 's not and most of the landscape area would still be retained we 're in that war it 's a getting rid of landscape area they 're all yep so either moving an amendment or foreshadowing and motion in the event that item one is lost now somebody needs to do something otherwise yep so you okay now in order to if that were to pass because one were to be lost as it stands and then that were to pass would we have required further information than is in this report in order to make that so it 's request a report considering the matter of in order to meet the needs of the Local Government Act yep of prudent decision it 's option 2 and the report we 've already got the report and it 's okay option C just for Shadow Watson okay that 's fine unless that 's done alright so for 16 years someone put the can opener in 16 years ago and it 's been stood around for ages and I think it 's time to just reseal it and put it back on the shelf and date it was at our community board meeting the first time 'm sure it 's been through the board before they it was during one of our board meetings at Council your hint and raised the traffic safety issues and the link through to the industrial area there which then lead to staff changing the recommendation to not do the long strip anymore to not to not sell a link strip anymore it 's not good practice for the council to continually open up access through to that industrial area where we have tried to create buffers between the residential and the industrial the property owner has exist from a driveway on the other side for this property for option one there and there is no need for this to happen so at the time to the ratio we can but on the shelf and move on okay so I 'll put the two parts of the motion separately so item warm all those in favor say aye against so that 's Yardley Dave against okay so that 's carried and then item two all those in favor say aye aye against that 's carried so both are carried thank you _"

    "text": "item 9 2 item 18 Pendleton winery Harewood proposed speed limit changes now on this one this is the one with some changes from what we 've got in the agenda so maybe if somebody can just give me the rationale or the thinking behind these changes although if that can be called out so that we can see the difference and have explained why there is a difference thank you consultation and there were deputations to the board on guys Road Corinne Road and a section of Ryan 's Road between the two proposed 18 to 60 weary assist that and there was an in line with the recommendations from the NZTA there was room for that and there 's a further plan that will be put to the border some other stage that this will fit nicely and with so staff I support that and those changes have been made to accurately reflect that and not that rest of that whole area and the other through consultation request that came was to reduce here Wood Road from the proposed 60 which is currently 80 250 outside the school we reassessed that we don 't believe we have that room to push that down any lower so putting forward as it is that that whole irid here would area one great thank you so are there any questions on this two things I wanna do the heel drag one of the guys rode one fifth guys right so reason for the change to guys rode becoming 60 K now from Ryan 's rode down but not the rest of the area was so the trucks would take the route that meant to take we know initially assist it the recommendations from NZTA is look they don 't want to 70k anymore they want to use those as let 's there would like them to be t temporary speeds so leaves us with a a 80 60 and those sections or lifestyle properties on guys and Kareena gave us the option to go either way and it would have been tidy to make it 80 but there is room they the submissions to the community board there 's a lot of families that use live that the kids go to that will fit the sixty category but the rest of severals road and the rest of conservators road that 's a totally different environment yeah so just to be really clear that Ryan 's Road only is 60 K until you get to Korea and then it changes that 's correct okay so then going to here Wood Road what would happen if we if the board has requested like what in CTA come down and give us a slap or what 's gonna be the situation so if I can just clarify for the council the section of this the community board and staff have a difference on is he would area one and that 's point five the approved the speed limit of he would Road east of Johns Road 250 h commencing at Johns Road and and moving in an easterly direction so that 's the one point so from a community board point of view we took the the community 's view introduced they do have the LED lights that do flash recognizing the same time you 're coming off Johns Road there which is an is a speed differential there they can just explain probably traffic assist mr. chair through you assisting this in accordance with the documents provided by NZTA they they support the 60 K speed limit for this whole area straight to Aaron 's question what would happen it would be posted at 50 I expect you 'd have an operating speed that would be higher than that simular to you that you do in the central city where people don 't they probably won 't be going they 'll be coming off Rusli road and they won 't be going 50 but the fact is there so thank you any further questions all right so do I have a mover for the community board recommendation Aaron do I have a seconder Jamie is there any debate yawning so so we just had a big debate about staff advice and going with it but now we 're gonna go against staff advice on this one so this is debate yeah so I just wanted to check on that I mean I 'm really sympathetic to the community board saying we should trust the community feedback and I do think and things like speed limits is really important so I 'm gonna side with the community board on this one against the staff advice just be really clear about that cool so peps a point of clarification is required in this instance it was yes in the system staff were required to provide recommendations to the community board they did that those recommendations it was severely close ran races to what what the right answer is the community board decided to do something slightly different and essentially with we 're supporting we 're supporting the community ordinance recommendations because the difference in outcome between the staff advice and the community board advice is you know is very it 's very slight so I don 't think that situation did actually arise the community boards made some recommendations and and we 're I guess our messages were actually quite happy to support those so the community board in recommendations are capable of it implemented staff have provided advice which initially was inconsistent with the community board recommendation what we 're hearing now is that capable have been worked with absolutely thank you with the Community Award around these complex issues thank you Karen yeah there 's just one other point which is part number 15 which is the board recommends that the council write to the Minister of Transport so you can approval for the ability to adjust the school speed limit zone timing because that was what come up in the deputation now when you go to what 's actually gazetted in the law and I don 't even know a page that would be page 55 periods of operation Part C 10 minutes at any other time when children cross the road or into leaves at the roadside so there is that ability to change what we don 't have in Christchurch is schools having access to that so what staff have said is that they can go away and work with this particular school and it 's probably got same to know if their location and being kind of half rural half City and stuff that they will work with them on how they can get access to that system when past for schools leaving them on that it didn 't work very well but they so I 'm just wondering with the 15 yeah we strike it out now because it 's not relevant yep so you 're the mover of this with that struck out you 're obviously confident in that other process that you 've just described and I think we can expect that that 'll happen coming thank you Sarah not just the timing of those speed limit signs but the actual speeds because they 've been times that we 've discussed it really really useful to do to do 30 kilometres an hour I can 't remember what that instead of 40 around schools that 40 kilometres prayer is an absolute regulatory it was the potential for asking for changes to the absolute on the timelines but it turns out there wasn 't an absolute did we want did we end up asking for the change in the absolute before should we we were after at the 30 instead of a 40 for those speed limits around schools yeah can we take that offline as part to their I mean it 's given that 15 has gone from the resolution that 's in front of us it 's probably not so relevant today but it is relevant to school speed zones in general all right again we can be comfortable that that will be reported back to us regardless of any resolution today can we yes yep great thank you alright so I put this motion all those in favor say aye against that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "next one Richmond Hills some proposed 40 K speed zone item 17 do I have a mover for this one okay there were many through the consultation process about the pedestrian safety concerns and while the process that staff have commented on the potential for a trick and it not being funded and things currently there goes through a sort of a small reserve site what I 'd like is for staff to be able to consider other pedestrian and safety enhancements and report back to the board I 've got it yeah well lots of complaints that investigate the pedestrian safety concerns on Richmond Hill Road outlined in the submissions and report to the board with potential solutions by the end of 2018 we do know it could email it through if you like okay bit staff investigate the pedestrian safety concerns on Richmond Hill Road outlined in the submissions and report to the board with potential solutions by the end of 2018 it might be that there 's a path somewhere else along the side of the road or something like there but there are some real concerns the pedestrian safety concerns wasn 't it yeah investigate thank you all right so just putting that to staff we 're obviously putting a timeline on that and it 's a piece of work is that something which is capable have been done in his capable have been reported within that time frame it 's fine we would be happy to assist thank you great all right so Sara you 're happy to move this with that addition do I have a seconder Mike so this is something which has come up a number of times maybe if staff could provide some comment on the use of mirrors so we do we have been doing some work on a mirrors purse policy pets we can share that with members interested in yeah and we can include that under the scope of fit incubation any further questions on this okay so it 's been moved and seconded all those in favor Oh Dave you got some debate consultation point of view where we say we have delivered cerca 450 pamphlets to the community and we had 68 responses which a rough the population of that particular area and then 58% of the people who responded supported a speed reduction so effectively we 've got something like about 6% of the residents in that area actually supporting a speed reduction I 'm not against the the speed reduction per se but it 's more the consultation process and I 've said this a few times that air air consultation process leaves us open to a bit of scrutiny to those and then have someone deliver them but for me I think you know we I don 't think we 're actually in many instances getting a an accurate representation of here communities of interest actually feel on things and and I think of anything that would be forbid a couple employed a couple of people and hadn 't go door-to-door with the questions that were asked very simply in the document and get a bit of perception of these things and it 's just not this particular one but other consultation processes that we get involved in around the city and I don 't think we 're actually getting a an accurate not actually fit so again to oppose this but I 'm really just making the point that I feel that our consultation does not accurately reflect that 's very briefly in response I mean while I agree that the a lot of the time that consultation processes aren 't as user friendly or as engaging as they could be actually the return on this is quite high for a speed limit change and to get that many responses from from a community as quite impressive however with these types of proposals when we say that we 're proposing to change something to make it safer edgy for the most part of people are happy with it they don 't bother submitting we 're as it tends to be that if they 're opposed to a proposal that they are more likely to submit so I think that that shows a quite overwhelming support for this proposal itself and you can see from the comments that people have made that people are engaged and concerned about safety issues on the hill generally anyway thank you Mike did I see you indicating 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye against that 's carried _"

    "text": "now moving on to the Lynwood central heathcote report item 15 are there any questions on these deal I have one question around the the parasite and what makes you believe that that 's strategic well that 's the decision the community I think the issue here is because these long term and so can you tell us why that lease is devaluing the site was worse than why is that the case when there 's publicly listed companies in their Building Council no no no because they that at least was re-signed how long ago yes I can we can have a conversation offline and I just want to know when the release was reassigned okay so that 's different to whether we retain the property or not and noting that the retention of following properties are for a future strategic purchase not a future strategic purpose not a current strategic purpose the lease was very signed in March 2018 for another seven years yes if we 're looking at strategic bits lamp we 've just basically written off a strategic piece of land there but what lease we long it 's a very different matter than whether we return a piece of land for a future strategic purpose or not so that 's outside of the scope of what we 're discussing today okay are there any other questions on this report Jamie yeah stripped by the art gallery do you want to spend on it just just a wee bit for me and why it 's not why we 're not gonna sell then if you look at the spreadsheet attached at the end of the report that outlines the community boards views or attainment so I think they wanted to investigate in sorry one of the primary drivers strategy and whether this property I think this valuable land was in the report we bought it so we can undertake work for both base isolation for the art gallery that 's now being gone yeah and I 'd be selling it all day long now it seems like the only decision in my view all right so that question that questions been asked and answered you 're comfortable with the answer Mike the community boards what was item thank you they 're clear at surplus in 17 so perhaps if I can expand because again one of my other hats is some of the accommodation strategies this property has no part in our thinking on future combination needs I think the other issue in arriving at the staff decision also was that there was not a budget plan and the LTP to develop this land for any purpose founded Council decision anywhere else so despite that staff advise the community board obviously had some discussion about this and arrived at the recommendation that 's in front of us if you look at the spreadsheet at the back it was a desire that the site not be considered an isolation corporate accommodation needs and options and solutions were the view to achieving efficiencies in that area in particular reducing corporate accommodation costs other options promoted was the idea of an artistic walkway there was also some discussion about where the council should retain this there was no idea if there was no identified need there was no sorry I 'm struggling to find the futures strategic purpose is think that clear strategic desire was that it be included in a larger accommodation with you to create efficiencies around accommodation doesn 't that 's the Art Gallery in any way shape or form need the land right so we haven 't asked the Art Gallery if they need to land before we do this well this is one that we 're proposing to retain rather than as I 'd like to see the rest I would 've thought in terms of proper process of the art gallery thought I needed this window would identify pitch so if you 're gonna hold the lane to develop it for an extension to the art galleries made sometimes the previous directors views but there 's nothing reflected in councils key policy documents the LTP or the infrastructure strategy around there thank you Mike I just want to signally I 'd like to move something when it 's time to move okay so are you wanting to removing the 62 across the street from the retaining great because I 'll be delighted to seek in there right so Mike you 'll move then adjacent to 62 Gloucester Street moved from the retention part of the motion into the declares the following property surplus for disposal presumably yep alright and Jamie you 're happy to second that so we 've now got a mover and a seconder for this with that change yawning it 's a bit frustrating you don 't go to the local councils first around opportunity when there 's no clear order and people jump in and move amendments but I just don 't just seek clarity from staff shadow something you 're most welcome so I just wanted to check with stuff when the corporate accommodation review will be complete and what the price is is reporting back that back to council so we 've got a process to report back to the executive team by later in the year but certainly in an overhaul the direction that we 're taking is to reduce overall costs by a consolidation and you 've seen that talked about in some of the media reports and we 've made some significant savings in the order of several hundred thousand dollars a year I eighty dollars a year over the last two years those figures haven 't_''_510.379 been reported but we have been making those savings we 're looking to make further rationalization and consolidation into this route into this building over the next three years and future forecasts don 't indicate that we 're going to need any additional space but that all needs to still be reported to the executive leadership team we can be rest assured we 've got a real focus on reducing those overhead costs to reduce the burden on ratepayers so us as elected council we 're not going to see the results of that didn 't say that well go through executive leadership first and get their approval so just in regards to how many sites are we currently leasing that are private sites within the central city at the moment for accommodation purposes one other site right which is 77 he referred no we 've exited 77 he referred and so they only thought we 've got now is one floor at HSBC sorry so it 's CC hlyst on Sidney Samaritan okay and just in concern over the type of development that was there so it was you know ridic high apartments in terms of if this is if the amendment which I don 't support goes through for disposal is there any ability to control the scale of development that goes in there so that so that it 's it 's you know keeping in character with the existing environment well yeah because the district plans pretty hopeless I think previously the apartment of Wynn and there was non complying for things like high-precision planes shading and I know certainly the art gallery and others were quite concerned that we 've got a beautiful art gallery that we 've spent a lot of money fixing and you could get you know if what was there before goes back and unset a secretory outcome so so the answer to the question is you and understand that may impact on the return you get and I 'm talking they 're not just monetary return but return in terms of your policy objectives which is to increase residential use in the city central city so those those as far as so we can talk through those aspects separately in the workshop final question I don 't know whether in order be able to answer this or not the Christchurch art gallery land clearly there was a decision made at the community board that that be retained rather than disposed was that a unanimous decision nor was it split okay all right okay it may not be relevant it was just of interest to know how robust the community board recommendation was but less versus making all right so what I 'll do taking the model from the previous one where there was a difference in opinion is that I 'll put the gallery land at 62 Gloucester Street first on its own and then I 'll put the rest of the motion altogether so item six the land to date adjacent to the art gallery so that 's if you vote yes that 's dispose of that if you vote no is to retain it so so six they art gallery land all those in faith so the motion is to declare the property surplus for disposal the can we make it a 6a and 6b in that case because that 's the only one that sits Putin that 's the reason I 'm putting it separately that 's the only one there 's any difference of opinion about it so 6a and 6b yeah that 's fine and I 'll put 6a separately and I 'll take debate on the whole lot now so yawning thank you so I 'm really grateful for staff doing a corporate accommodation review and particularly pleased to hear that we 've only got one site now that we 're parents that we 're leasing we 've spent a fortune as a city paying for private land owners to fix their buildings and having corporate accommodation since the earthquake while our own buildings are not being fixed and we got very even in this building we 've gotten a good very expensive partnership with no Tahoe that is costing us so much money so much money I think we 've now got and maybe things have changed post earthquake but certainly pre-earthquake I think this nhts BC were the highest rentals idea that we would wait for the results of that corporate review I think make a lot of sense other discussion at a community board we 're also as a count so we 're actually leasing a number of private sites in the Central City for car parking and yet we 've got our own site sitting there where we 're not putting our own vehicles or our own fleet we 're actually renting those from private land owners at a significant cost so I can 't see any sense and selling off that are disposing of the site now until that corporate accommodation review is done and it should include things like car parking should also include things like cycle parking we know that is gonna be at some stage in the near future a scheme around cycling in the city where are all the cycle is going to go so there 's a number of things that could be used in terms of the site it 's actually not a very easy site to develop I think it 's smaller than what it was previously or slightly more you know that the idea of what you could get there I think is pretty pretty limited anyway regardless of a district claim which is incredibly permissive when it comes to things like height and even design so I think it actually makes sense just to hang on to this land a little for a little bit longer it was unfortunate this was raised when the art gallery appears we 're coming to council around doing sort of looking at the synergy but we don 't seem very good as an organization at looking at synergies between when we 're doing repairs and what the opportunities are for land that we hold adjacent which is a real shame never get and will cost effective or efficient time to to do things when we 've got contractors on site and close proximity previously I was aware that the art gallery were interested in retaining a site as a protection against future development and also for possible expansion and I 'd really like that advice and that view to come back before we make the decision to dispose of it so it just don 't think we should be making that decision now it 's all vote against the amendment thank you deal I 'm just gonna talk about the parasite because I 'm also I 'm just gonna vote against that specific one and the rest of it actually I 'm I 'm okay with the parasite was bought in 2008 from the council is an interest-only purchase it 's costing the council money obviously for an interest-only purchase and we 're leasing it out at the moment since the earthquakes for a nominal price and and I believe it was probably costing the city money so I can 't see it is a strategic it doesn 't have a strategic purpose at the moment and I just don 't want so I just want to voice my objection to actually having it as a strategic thing I think we need to actually look at that sign and actually look at the lease and think about that whole thing a little bit more seriously than just keeper than our keeping it and just leaving it I just don 't think it vote against that one chingling thank you really quickly on the parasite I personally believe it does hit a strategic and after the earthquake Evan the city was a dead zone and people who want to touch it with a barge pole and we gave the ability to the private sector and young technology innovative industries to have a place to work with shared spaces and in my view epic has been a real success story and forms a key part of the innovation precincts I 'm fine with that Oh jump to 62 Gloucester Street and in my view that is a site that should most certainly be sold and also it 's great the president 's been see it throughout this process with these papers that counselors know best and we can alter the community board recommendations here because that 's what I 'm quite keen to do right now with 62 Gloucester Street so I wasn 't sure staff had originally suggested that this site should be sold or not but and that it was later amended by the community board but the faith staff had actually pragmatic and sensible council property team is because I think that 's completely the correct decision the land was purchased when I was on the council part of the council that purchased it simply to undertake base isolation for the Art Gallery and then to dispose of it afterwards job done get rid of it and I will tell you the best reason why it should be gone fifty three percent fifty three percent rate rises on the cards over the next ten years and holding on to every little thing because we could do something cool maybe perhaps one day is not enough good enough reason for me to hang on to it it served its purpose and let 's realize the capital now thank you okay so I 'm a little bit confused about some of the debate on the parasite to say that we should dispose of a property but then at the same time suggest that we should deal with the least and consider the use of the site of course once we 're sold the site we don 't have any influence over at all little bit confused about that but some I will now you 'll notice we put 5a 5b and 5c or I put five a separately given that there 's been an indication that there isn 't you know universal support around there on the art gallery site I don 't see any harm in either whether there are a number of things we might want to do checking in with the current director of the gallery that his view is the same as the former director of the gallery checking that there isn 't anything here that we 've missed and hopefully getting to a space in future where a community board recommendation and a staff recommendation could line up would be a good place to be in that certainly doesn 't preclude the future sale of this site if that 's what 's decided after that further work has been done a little bit like the first one I would hate to think that we 're missing any opportunity for anything here given what we 've heard from staff I suspect that we may not be but just to final decision on this I think is possibly prudent so I 'll put 5a separately I 'll put 6a separately and then once we 've dealt with that I 'll put the whole motion that remains so on 5a all of those in favor say aye those against so there are two votes against yeah so you want a division or you just want those a division right can we have a division please so this is on 5a only five eight this is five eight five eighty to retain so five a are you voting for retention or not right okay so there was one dissenter which is Dion okay that 's fine no let 's go to 6a and this is the proposal is to declare the following property surplus for disposal 6a all of those in favor say aye aye against no just you and I in that and pulling and an okay because are you calling for a division or not if it would help why are you calling for a division a little bit so you use its past oh so we 're selling it that prisoners have been settled very sensible this so so now I 'm gonna put everything else that we haven 't dealt with so the rest of the motion all of those in favor say aye aye against that 's carried thank you _"

the shape of the site the the services and the easements that are over it the zoning you know it 's not one that and I was also again putting on both been trying to reinforce to councillors with an interest in social housing that land is not our issue Capital is our issue so perhaps if you were really concerned from a social housing perspective I 'd be looking at maybe directing the returns from the sale of this into investment in social housing purposes that might be a better way forward if you want to achieve your outcomes then necessarily focusing on getting additional land yeah I think the concern is that the strategy of just intensifying existing social housing sites and not getting a geographic distribution but you guys have looked at it yes briefing on that back in November last year as well so um you know our directions on those matters okay so this has been moved and seconded is there any debate on this I 'll put the motion say something I 'm just thinking the here what I 'm Bruce is saying so is there any way that we can going forward get some sort of recommendation or note to put there in future any discussions about properties being you know whatever the correct weirdest 's going forward so rather than trying to do it retrospectively as we are today that we go forward with means as well so that those who have consumed that we might be giving up land that could be used for social housing will be reassured that there has been considered in the decision-making well I think we 've heard from staff that that 's already did happen or certainly what 's capable of happening as part of the community board discussions but I 'm sure staff will take away from the issues that have been raised around this table today into any future processes that there needs to be robust consideration of land for social housing purposes before recommendations come here that may well have been the case with these anyway but equally taking to account the comments that Bruce made that identifying land for social housing isn 't necessarily something that should be our highest priority if our outcome is building as much social housing as we can in the shortest possible time but I think I mean if staff wanted to reflect that back you as certainly discussion today is the land suitable for social housing is something that should be on our radar we need to reinforce it we can make it much clearer in it but I can definitely assure you we apply that lens you 're very much aware that we 've just for instance purchased a vineyard I 'm already getting the social housing staff to look at the house on that site to say would that be suitable the initial views is no it 's not it 's an away from services it 's away from public transport it 's the wrong size wrong shape but we do do those exercises they 're the types of things that we just do on a daily basis it doesn 't necessary need to be brought to your attention but we do do these things and that 's good for us to know so thanks very much indeed for that response yawning question of clarification for a four thousand over four thousand mitad squid section the valuation seems very low it 's a hundred thousand is there a reason why the valuation is so low for industrial development and we 've previously had submissions around and in this wider vicinity being quite highly valued for its industrial rezoning purposes the purposes of this proceeding we did not get properties because these are known I understand that so previously we fed people in the Avon hit area come to Council for land that was rezone with industrial capability having their rates go up something like I don 't know how many times so you remember the guys that came in and they were and so this land is in the similar vicinity and yet it 's very very low valued you try to size long terms of the market no no I 'm not I 'm trying to say it 's low in terms of ratable values for other land that had industrial zoning in this area I think the question in terms of today 's process though is really to what extent would the value of the land play into a decision to either disposal retained we 're not agreeing today to dispose at a certain price or with certain conditions we 're either agreeing all factors associated with the land including rezoning potential effect was an issue thinking and we would benchmark thank you so I 'll now put the motion all those in favor say aye all right against that 's carried now _"

    "text": "to item 13 so this is spray tan Kashmir so are there any questions on this first of all Tim my understanding and we 've got our wonderful deputy chair sitting between you and we 've got my colleague here so I 'm sure some will throw an object at me if I 'm wrong first applies no Christian air board said absolutely sell it 's an interesting piece of land which has just a cost to the right path across roof so no no question there so I think I 'm right with it Albert Terrace when this came to the community board we talked about the Mount Vernon and Trust who do an outstanding job and as a council we talked about partnerships at cetera but they put everything they 've got into maintaining the Mount Vernon area again spend dollars more sorts of things and plantings so we asked if the Akopian option to gift their land to them to increase the value of what they 're doing but that 's not reflected here at all it 's correct okay so he 's no dispute about that to add something to this resolution to ensure that there happens we would be able to do that given that we 've just heard that that 's what 's intended and it wouldn 't make any difference other than to ensure that it happens okay so I would like to add to be willing to the land has offered to in the first instance the lane is offered to the Port Hills trust or they give them first opportunity to gift that rather than okay is it so to move this with this with this is a gift so there 's nothing as a gift to transfer ownership you know I think that 's a discussion we should have with important Hills Trust does come an issue with the PX item which we can 't talk about then if that 's what we 're going to be talking about in process so I just want to raise that now and the third 90 Hoon hey Road and deputy chair Melanie Koch has done an amazing amount of work with this local community there is no question there is want and regards to retention of this property following a b c d e if and five so can we skip that and the community board work with the community because it 's really what the community board if we 're talking with regards to our colleagues around the table saying that we take this to community boards they make a comment and then it 's changed to council the comment as i understand it from my colleagues on the community board was that this has definitely wanted to be retained and that we can work with the community lead bike melanie and the work she 's done rather than having to go through all this rigmarole can i comment on that not taking away from the good work and and the perceived need and all where the work that hasn 't been done and will speak to that and that i 'm not saying that 's a good or bad outcome the work that hasn 't been done is have we got an end a see i don 't like the community services support because they 'll be the end owner they may well do but that that question has not been answered so we just need to tidy up that end of it before a definitive decision is made this so after that process has been gone through you know we 're saying we 're retaining conditional upon those things if those conditions weren 't met would you then need to bring this back to either the board or to us or whatever the process is for a further explicit decision to dispose the this doesn 't we 're not making a decision on us we saying what parking it will go through all that work we 'll bring it back to the community board one way or the other yes it can 't_''_381.15 be supported all these things have been checked off in terms of good management practice ownership and it can be supported it can 't_''_390.81 be for these reasons so either it 'll be retained because these conditions are met or if you bring back a recommendation to dispose then that 'll be subject to a further decision at that time and we may or may not that gives the surety that is needed use community facility and inspiration of the kitchen so we 've asked for staff to look at which I just wanted to make it clear that you know we do want to retain this buildings how and at the end we do that yeah I think that 's clear from what 's in front of us here I think that 's that 's reflected given that we know that it would need a further decision to dispose so we 're not saying that the default is we dispose unless we 're saying we retain on these conditions so if we were to dispose it we need to further explicit decision to do that film it seems to me that a to a are redundant they 've already been done and we 're even the time when the board was required to support this actually so my question is do we really need to include a to Enel and and I guess I would say that with the time that has passed I would have thought that an identified sponsor would have that all okay paddles ROC so accept me I don 't think but what can we not take out a 2e because it just seems to add something that is now unnecessary because it 's all been done well with all due respect I do not believe we 've been through 18 we haven 't asked the group for a business case we haven 't asked community services that this aligns with the strategy and plans please do not take this as a negative comment that we 're not supporting it I 'm just saying they are good management practices we need to go through so you saying Angus that in fact the board will still need to provide a business case around this is that the group will see this group was put in there on a temporary basis because the building was because we replaced it with and it was sitting idle and it was seen better to put a tenant in the I would just put on it there was not a robust process around there it 's a good use it 's working really well attracting from that is pointy so there 's no funding set aside for the maintenance and the other costs associate the moment it sits within my area and I have a small budget from other departments and it 's fair to say that that budget is constantly under pressure I would need to for long-term holding transfer to Holland I appreciate that and it is in the long-term plan however like what I 'm just going back to my earlier earlier question with respect to you Angus are you really saying that a business case needs to be established by a little small community group in order for them to actually I guess you know being involved with and and participate and engage with the community based on what is already a community yes is that why you say correct I mean we don 't we don 't buildings at least we understand the nature of them how viable they are and it 's just not financial that 's in terms of their ability to continue to manage this look I understand that its operating really well I understand they 're a really but we do not know that background information that we would normally get but we presumably would go to the group with some specific questions about things that we would want to say and we would assist them in providing and we would make it as easy as possible for them to provide that information and it 's probably I imagine around financial robustness and good governance and those sort of things which are things that you would expect a volunteer group would be able to provide reasonably easy in as much as they would provide it to their regular committee meetings or board meetings or whatever we 're not asking them to create a in a 140 page document with a strategic plan and all of that this is about in its rich respective in this case because we put them in here this is about Prudential management and decision-making and what we want to do is make sure again consolidate this decision make it permanent that we actually now go through that all right one it 's not onerous it should be as you say information they can question and I mean I 'm happy to move this but one final question with regards to it what would be the timeline to for this community group and I 'd say the community board will be working hand-in-hand with them because melanie has done a fantastic job with this group and there is absolutely a clear need in this community and we 're really just talking about a new community facility that is badly needed in this area so how long do they all they have or will we have working with our community to deliver to your satisfaction ABCDE and even technically and five its to the community board satisfaction following sign-off today I 'll create a project brief give that to one of my team and those can start looking into it straightaway as Andrew said this is not information that they will not have at their fingertips I think they should be able to turn that around within a week or two in our discussions internally with community services should run in parallel so this is a process I think to take we and we need signed off decision but it 's process that can take two to four months at the most could I ask that they keep in touch with their deputy chair because she 's the one that 's been working with this community at this I care with my colleague and we pleased to make this as it is we wouldn 't do this without engagement with the community thank you great thank you further questions okay so this has been moved with wording that 's in front of us now by Tim do I have a seconder for this film is there any debate Phil look I won 't support these today but I do think that these some of these processes are absolutely archaic how can we like the concept of expected any small community group Bruce any form of business case we need to change our language and have a language at least user friendly and also these processes need to be more workable this has taken ages of course I was part of the committee board decisions and I supported them it 's it 's kind of like more easily and simply than these quite archaic processors I thought was very clear with regards to you know Vista place absolutely it 's a that 's great so in whatever it 's worth we 'll get and we put their back into the pot is a colleague across this you know hopefully it 's going to lessen the burden of Rights which son Albert Terrace we see is adding value to an organization that is giving incredible value for very little bit so I think that you know it was really clear from us so to help this Rickman role is my colleague Phil said you know it 's just a wee bit interesting to say the least this is really clear this community needs a space there was a space vacant and his anger said that was just setting the earth not used community groups come in they 're using it and I just found out today there are some other groups edding wanted to add to that to make it even more valuable so to go through this rigmarole and as Phil said you know not all business plans at Citra because you know it 's it 's not what so I 'm going over this and I 'll actually support it because we have to work hand in hand with their communities but it does seem to be a bit of a disconnect between the community board and what we talked about to the paper that 's in front of us but I 'm hopefully we 're all on the same page thank you and I 'd like to just encourage Mel to say that we have a great model of this hitting was the old portal library in it and it can 't_''_957.97 be done it can be done well staff staff working incredibly supportive of it and it 's well used and it 's a fantastic asset for at the community so I 'm sure that those folk out there Chris Hall and Coe would be very supportive and helpful in terms of you guys are moving forward and getting it to work for you guys as well so yeah really encourage you it 'll be you 'll get yet yeah you know I words business case we 're not looking at that in the same ways for example we would talk about the business case for the stadium you know I mean this is a small group this is a small group the information that they will have to provide will be minimal given that they 're a small group I mean I 'd like to think that what we 're looking at is just some sensible due diligence around as a financially robust have they got good governance processes have they got a future we need to be responsible that we 're not setting up a group like this to fail so we 've got work that we need to do so that we 're we 're sure that we 're not doing this I 'd like to think it 's in that spirit and I think with the Deputy Chair of the community board involved it will be that it 's in that spirit that we 're working with this group in a collaborative way so that they can provide information that actually we should want to see so that we we know that they 've got a future in this building if that 's the decision that we make and of course the default is we retained building and subject to these things you know we would identify this as the public use it would require a further explicit decision of Council to dispose of this building I think it 's clear that the view of the board and the view of a number of people around this table is that we get a good outcome here I don 't think we 're in the business of putting hurdles in the way of good outcomes we 're in the process of working with groups so that we can get to them and I hope I 'm right in saying that I 'm confident that that is exactly the way we 're approaching this so I hope some of the concerns that have been expressed around the table turn out not to be as valid as you know people maybe have thought they are I hope we 're in a good space where we 're going to work hand in hand them providing reasonable information that we actually as a council should be reasonably expecting to be provided so having said that I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye against that 's carried thank you now moving on to item _"

    "text": "that was a reasonably long ten minutes but that 's alright okay so next let 's move to the path ie s so this now brings us to item organized here so the property review process outcomes so item 12 property review process we 've got staff here for this great thank you so coastal Burwood is the first one item 12 so Bruce welcome to the table there may well be questions on some of these were there any introductory comments you wanted to make about the process in general or anything specific in this report all right so are there any questions on this coastal Burwood item 12 Glen very quickly to Bruce but not only just about this report but whether and the option does potentially present itself in this report but in all the reports of scattered potential opportunities I think for a workshop over maybe some social housing options so I 'm thinking if we do get a bit fall down because there quite a few properties for disposal that we could look at an option of say a workshop so when we come to there the Lake Terrace Road reserved that could be a candidate and as we go through the reports we could look at that so I 'm not sure what you think about that process wise having both hats the property hat and the social housing hat we 've looked through to identify whether any of these would be suitable for social housing there 's been a number of properties that were in the original scope that have been already removed out and counseled previously made decision to history listen with the properties that and the return we got from the residential redzone there was a shortfall to the housing fund from that return and we needed to top that up from the general housing or the general counsel portfolio so we went through this portfolio and reviewed which sites could be suitable for housing purposes we 've already transferred those out there may still be some other minor sections in there that could be suitable for social housing purposes and we can look through again as well if you wish so if we were to run a process that if the recommendations that are in front of us today in respect of these next four reports that obviously results in a decision to dispose of some parcels of land if we wanted to add a further step into that process that required staff advice on whether any of those parcels for disposal were suitable for social housing would that be the way to do that how would we pick that up because once we 've made a decision to dispose we 've made a decision to dispose this was raised by some of the boards some of the board meetings the response to that was we these waivers and a problem for social housing capital for development and these are all quite small bits and pieces it needs nothing significant and he we 'll be suitable for social housing on a reasonable scale but we would like to build on a small scale do the odd house here a man certainly not on the disposal pieces some of this stuff there you 're looking to retain purposes we could certainly look at that aspect and presumably was as part of boards felt that there might have been potential for social housing outcomes that might have been a reason for them to recommend the retention of a parcel of land rather than disposal so Angus you 're suggesting that the boards had the opportunity to pick that up at their individual meetings where they meet these recommendations and the and you 've also said to us this morning an answer to this question that none of the property which is proposed to be disposed would be suitable for social housing correct this is an opportunity to look at this not just for social housing but any other public work so if councillors were of a mind to request a workshop on whether any of the land proposed to be disposed of was suitable for social housing your advice is that none of it is suitable for social housing so that would seem like a bit of a redundant thing to do I think with an interest wanted some reassurance we could easily we 've got a workshop planned on social housing matters tomorrow we could easily show them and show the quickly allay their concerns once they saw the photos of you know the narrow strips and so on that our ones are being proposed for disposal it 's this is not from residential sections that be identified for the suppose of the some like 69 on properties and and this whole process across all the boards there 's only so far bit 13 yep so your advice is that none of this will be suitable for shows of social housing and if we saw further detail on the properties to be disposed of we would your view is that we would we would share that position so really the question for councillors is whether they want to take that advice or whether they want to go through the process of looking in more detail at the properties to be disposed of to make sure that there aren 't any social housing outcomes that we 're missing out on and of course you know I come back to the point once we 've made the decision today to dispose we 've done this so if there was any further information or would need to be before rather than after so certainly you know appreciating the advice that you 've just provided there remains I think a question for counselors as to whether they want to take that advice and proceed regardless or whether they want further reassurance by looking in more detail prior to making the decision I 'll come back to questions and I 'll come back to Glen page one four five for instance talks about that as a possibility fair housing so it seems to that 's over and Heath get there which one is the Garland 's right so I suspect if it sees them I 'm just trying to pull it up that is one that 's not is it in the disposal category is that in their hold to be reviewed for another purpose get in the for review yeah so I was probably being pulled out for that purpose okay so that 's a clear indication of the community board having considerable Turner public uses and you 're actually with us for social all right so yeah I mean what we 're interested in the disposal decision so that really it 's if there is anything on in these recommendations that we are disposing of that we don 't feel that we 've adequately looked at the possibility for social housing so in the list for review obviously that can still be reviewed but today these are final decisions on disposal we wouldn 't want to be making a final decision on disposal unless we were confident that there wasn 't an alternative suitable use and I guess from the line of questioning Glen that you 're pursuing social housing would be paramount in our thinking there yep all right continuing with questions Phil it 's really just in terms of the process like it just seems to me that in fact counsel have got another lens to look over things for example including social housing as well as advice from staff and like I 'm just going also concerned that some of the processes as a counselor just seemed to me continuing to be and monied lessly arduous like when there 's a clear recommendation from the board for example and it relates there to be to be part of the port of the portholes and which which we own and it 's Mount Vernon in particular in fact there should be a simpler way to do that rather than have a sail process as well it just seems to me that a workshop would allow us to look at these processes as well mr. chairman well should we refer all of these four reports to a workshop of counselors so that we can deal with the issues that have been raised I mean we 've got recommendations from the board in front of us clearly there are some questions around to what extent the board considered in each case for example the suitability for social housing and also further advice needed on what the next steps are particularly where there might be an outcome for a piece of land that it become amalgamated with a reserve or something of that nature rather than disposed of the other thing we could do is go through these reports and declare property surplus for disposal where there is no question that there 's an alternative you 've just outlined and refer the others to a workshop so that at least we 're making some decisions today and those where there is still an element of doubt we refer to a workshop of all counselors for further discussion and then we would bring those back as the subject of a further we altered to say any properties must go through the community boards for a recommendation and this is what we see today just recap the history of those it was very useful yep previously we used to circulate properties of this nature on an individual basis and we were struggling to get decisions on what to do with them so then we thought well let 's do it on a portfolio basis and adopter process now we developed a process we workshop that with every single community bought a couple of times and so we had we had a bit of a presentation when people up to the idea then we developed the process put that through every single community board then we put it to counsel and counsel did sign off on this process think in terms of making decisions on individual properties if the council as a whole do not exceed the board 's decisions or preferences on those properties then the council can today look at those individually and and ask for something else to be done yeah so you can type the once in your writings or about how you 're articulating it we require specific we 've got to make a definitive decision on a half-dozen properties that is reversible we need to get on and then sell it if you don 't want to do that you can 't park those off to the side and go despite what the board 's assessment is lease yep so so let 's continue the process that you 've just described by using standing orders to run a good process at this meeting we 've got recommendations in front of it from each board in front of us if anybody around the table wanted to move an amendment which was different than that recommendation they can do this and that reckon that that amendment might be to refer a particular property for whatever it may be as appropriate for that property people around this table are able to ask questions in respect of each of the properties that we 're disposing of in particular today and that would then probably lead to those amendments if indeed anybody wanted to move them so let 's just run a tight process with standing orders realizing that there are ways of picking these things up if people indeed have concerns it 's good that some questions have been asked that have raised this but let 's not try and reinvent a process when we 've got a set of standing orders let 's use the standing orders to get to what will turn out to be the right outcomes are supported by majority so Angus thanks for your comments there let 's continue with questions and then yep we 'll just run the meeting and it 'll it 'll land where it lands and Tim and then eonni and this is general questions about the process and questions specifically on this report that 's in front of us at the moment we 'll deal with table I can understand the risks people are consuming recommending to support community board delegations and we come back and and micromanager comes back so in considering yep yeah so in considering whether anybody wanted to move an amendment to change any of these community board recommendations to not respond to the community board recommendations by agreeing to them obviously one of the things we would take into account would be the weight that we give to the recommendation of the community board there may well be people around the table that have the view if this is the view of the board then we support it and it goes through and that seems to be the comment that you 're making the three properties for item 13 okay can we just deal was because it relates to the PX item that we 've got about process because everyone 's using the term process so one of these one of these properties I think can relate to the PX which makes it very hard so there are three properties here one the community board and I 'm Melanie Koch who work with the community and there was a clear need in want for the property one is my colleague for clear would have said is absolutely the community board agreed that it could be sold there 's no question about there and the third one we had a vision for there which is quite logical which then relates to the PX item much yeah and in the question about process so you tell me where we 're it because I can 't discuss that because it 's a PX item so either we could hold item 13 to 2 on the table till we 've discussed the PX item and then bring it back and discuss it but for the our community as far as I 'm concerned and my colleague and Melanie can put me right the the 90 who 's a Rhodes is very clear there 's a want community so if we put this into a process we now seem to be debating an amendment to item 13 that hasn 't been moved or seconded yet so that 's the way that we 'll deal with it only really a handful that could be used for housing and we don 't need to make decisions on them today the staff office have given some initial advice that they don 't think they 're suitable for larger scale social housing and I would agree because these are much smaller but in terms of the idea of using them at one or two you know it 's I think there is a potential there so I 'm just I just wanted to check because this was original aged by the board or the board counselor they also chairs our housing subcommittee and as on the local community board and their community board did not recommend this the section at Lake Terrace for social housing but that 's the concern that 's been raised and so I just was interested if the community would considered it for social housing and if not I would like to move in amendments for that Lake Terrace reserve to 40 that that be not disposed of and considered for housing yep all right so let 's capture that as an amendment and we 'll a question as far as the coastal board was concerned we have discussed this at length and I take Pauline 's point you know we 've given delegations to the boards to do this and now we 're coming back here litigating it so if there was one issue that I would probably like to see addressed is that there 's actually a review of all council properties some of which could be deemed to be serviced we had a list I think of 365 properties that council either owned or had an interest in in the coastal Burwood Ward and I know for a fact they 're of a couple of parcels of land or at least one that I 've been happy ok we 're supposed to be in questions at the moment we 're now debating Yanni 's amendment there hasn 't yet been seconded it 's not a point of order we 've got a recommendation in front of us there 's an amendment been moved it 'll either be seconded or it won 't_''_1171.65 and you 're actually speaking to the matter that 's raised the amendment up on the screen please can we get wording for the amendment please so yoni are you happy to move the whole thing with that amendment included and Viki are you happy to second and there is a need for single section sections upon which some of the houses can be put and that won 't have been known even three weeks ago so I would I don 't even mind if they just ring and say would any of these sections be suitable before they 're sold so but I just would like us having contributed to it and gotten it going to actually consult with them before we actually finally dispose of them you know don 't mind if it 's a much simpler process than just a phone call all right but you 're not obviously comfortable to decide to dispose today until that 's happened which is the reason you 're seconding there which Claire for talking about housing first I thought that they 're looking for trying to get existing houses this is vacant section this is in are you looking at a who makes the decision about disposal to them or otherwise because you 're giving the team the decision you 're making do you want to hold this property for counsel to put into its housing for portfolio and develop that means you got to park it off to the side we retain it do you want to dispose of it in your first preferences to dispose of it to a social housing provider then you could declare a surplus that creates a positive obligation to sell and you could condition that on that we first attempt to dispose of it to social housing providers so you 're making a disposal decision conditional on it landing up in a certain area if we can 't achieve that with housing first or housing New Zealand remember then we dispose of it on the open market in accordance with their policy so I 'm not too sure what you 're trying to achieve but I think that 's the two rooms at the least we work we write in the process like if we don 't agree to dispose of it today then that might be council retaining it and leasing it to a community housing provider it might be you know transferring it at low value to listen market value to to the benefit of social housing but it just seemed to me that we could quite easily if you look at these sections I mean most of them won 't be suitable for housing there 's probably two or three that might be and we just I don 't know why we can 't just get the easy decisions don 't today that 's what I 'm doing get a little bit more advice back on the ones that you know so you 're moving this and you 're not comfortable with to be being disposed of so what you 're moving is disposed of to a retain one a B and C and do something different as per item four now with to be and you can move whatever you want in terms of to be if you 're comfortable with the wording that we 've got there then that 's what you 'll be moving yeah I was happy been robbery and the contamination and whether that was a result of demolition yes we 've done testing that we suspected as due to prior duty demolitions so I don 't think it 's significantly contaminated I just wondered I mean probably this is the Tully wrong report to address it but it seems to be a kind of a common theme that 's occurring go into this because it may not be as common as you want the decisions that we 've been asked to make today around those muscles around is what do we retain and what do we dispose of if there 's anything where we feel that we need more information in order to make that decision we can ask for that further information but let 's not stray off into larger higher-level discussions about land in general it 's these parcels of land but we 're talking about today so Jana you 're happy to move the wording that we 've got here okay do I have a seconder for the wording that Yanni 's moving Glen no yes yes I live in the street think you 're conflicted that 's your choice so Phil will second so Yanni is moved and Phyllis seconding the wording that we 've got in front of us is there any debate on this David yes I 'm going to vote against this resolution primarily due to the fact and this will happen with all the other ones we have gone through a process with staff have come to our community board we have debated the issue we have the chairman of the Housing Committee on here on our board we have another member who thinks in the same way but our board decided on balance that we wanted to retain those three and dispose the other two so we have gone through a board process we have made a recommendation based on our knowledge of the area and whether these things are practical or otherwise and accepted the advice of staff and I think to be coming now to a council meeting and re-litigating decisions that board boards have made is not in the spirit of how we 're supposed to be working with our community boards so today we have gone through a process at our board board has recommended and gone along with a staff recommendation and here we get to Council and and the community boards view is just going to be disregarded so I will vote against that motion Thank You Jamie if I may just speak to this amendment but in doing so I 'll just speak to all of these what we 've got is a motion that 's been removed a motion which has been moved which is amended from the recommendation of the community board so this is what 's been moved and seconded and if I may when I speak on this amendment I might just allude to the entire recommendation so I don 't need to pipe up every time around it because it 's then it done once and done for once and for all so look look there 's been a robust and comprehensive process that 's got us to the point that we 're at now the reason we 're doing this is so we can realize capital more capital means leases required by wider organization could be looking at selling more than what 's even being recommended here but in saying it and I can completely concur with what Elaine said what Davis said we have charged our community boards was going through a robust process they 've done a lot of work and we ought to trust them we don 't so my personal view is that we have a set of good recommendations that have been arrived at through good process and I don 't want to read it again now and I personally if I could would just move the block of recommendations as a whole but I won 't be supporting the amendment and and for the reasons that I 've just outlined and I hope that we can get on with it and actually just back our community boards like we always say that we do thank you Yanni I think what 's become apparent in the last few weeks has been we have a huge increase in demand for social housing in New Zealand and in our city we 've also seen through that future growth pattern or that the needs are going to be astronomic going forward we know very clearly that we have insufficient budget and our current LTP to address the demand in the need and we also know we just and it 's a shame obviously it 's it 's just happened yesterday but we 've heard from the OTT Community Housing Trust that they 've done a bit of work around social housing and I 've asked if we can get briefed on it because one of the key things that they raised was that how you design social housing is not necessarily just about putting a whole bunch of intensive social housing into big areas but actually maybe look at spreading it out a bit more and I actually have a lot of sympathy with that there 's areas of the city that have got huge amounts of social housing and places like Philips Town which have had basically a community and social housing doubled since the earthquake with a huge community impact places like Richmond that have got these huge housing New Zealand developments and tints of social housing apartments being have no social housing at all at a time when we know we 've got a huge demand and need coming in front of us so I actually think the idea of putting sweating out some of the social and community housing into smaller sized sized sections around the city makes a lot of sense and that stuff that 's just kind of come available recently I do commend staff for the process I mean I think this has been a very good process over what could be a very contentious issue of selling off council owned assets in terms of our land but I actually think the process has been really good it just when I look at most of these they make a lot of sense this one in particular though it 's actually a bigger section and than the house that I own so I 'm sure it 's suitable for housing and I just want some more time for us to consider that and I had concerns however because I 'm not sure 100% whether the social housing liens was applied really robustly during the community we knew a part of this vote and I didn 't ask how the vote went around the table and perhaps I should have however going forward when these come back the community board recommendation in the future providing I 'm assured that there has been a very robust discussion and a robust leans put across the social housing options so today I 'll support this but next time I think we want to make sure that this has been considered during the discussion is really taken now from a process point of view in as much as nobody has foreshadowed any further amendments people have indicated that they 're gonna vote against presumably this means that they would vote against the whole resolution even though possibly the part of the resolution they 're not comfortable with his item for now this isn 't an amendment the resolution has been moved with a change in the community board documentation the staff recommendation so in the event that this resolution is lost so you Jamie will foreshadow the original recommendation would be so in the event that this fails I I that that answers the question I thought I was going to have that 's great back to debate Glenn and then Phil sorry there are different views on this these the bigger picture the homeless you we see on the streets in our city is symptomatic of a lack of social housing and it works the other way too so when there is sufficient social housing you have less homeless so that 's the bigger picture which the whole of New Zealand is facing it 's because the housing system in New Zealand is broken that 's why we have homeless on our streets throughout the entire country 23,000 in Auckland alone so there are not different components that are not joined up in the housing system they all belong together back on the smaller picture I think we will find today that by and large we will most likely approve the community the various community boards recommendations now I think all boards and all of us know that when community board recommendations come to council it 's not necessarily an automatic tick and they 're actually to vote against show of no-confidence all boards know that they must then go through another filter which is the council itself so I think we 've been quite reasonable in that respect the housing situation is fluid we 've heard about the work that the housing first project is doing we also know through the greater partnership conversations how pressing the need will continue to become for the baby boomer bubble as it makes its way through time and our demographic and that if we actually don 't attend to this we will have more homeless on the streets so anything we can do small or large adds up I want to say from a community board perspective that is not a universal view David the board councillors are the bill would representatives on that board certainly holds social housing and community values dear to their hearts so just want to make that clear from that perspective too so I hope that you will support this writ at this sir recommendation today Thank You Phil City milk I certainly want to approve the the recommendations as they are were the changes that times it 's really important then when we have a major issue in our country in our city and in fact as a council we take notice of it I don 't believe actually I mean it 's no no disrespect to the community boards that they that they were we or firstly there 's a lot of new information for us now anyway especially in terms of the size of the problem and the lack of social housing and we can 't expect community boards to be across that the the issues for example or have a lens of social housing that we spent as a council spent a lot of time on so it just seems to me this this these sections do a potential to potential to possibly add to our housing portfolio and if we don 't if we just go back to what was the original community board recommendation in fact we forfeit that land so once it will be disposed it 's gone that 's it and at a time when in fact we need to find every possible piece of land which could in support of these recommendations in front of us thank you don 't give stuff to community boards to do the work it 's gonna come back and be changed by council it 's much quicker just to do it ourselves after I review the process particularly here five point seven point four here particular emphasized supporting council strategy you know in the component area not is distracted this kind of the facility housing of peaceful days non SOC citywide issue in this kind citywide issue rather than just coming to some interesting points have been made in this debate I mean arguably it 's become a debate about social housing and the issue of housing in our city unequally it 's become a debate about the delegations to community boards and the level of weight we should give to community board recommendations when they come back to Council the matter we 're considering there 's given rise to that of course is whether we dispose of parcels of land or not but having said that housing is something that we look at at a high level and we need issue and unless we do something about it it 'll continue to be an issue and of course in disposing of a piece of land that 's a final decision once we make that decision there 's no going back on that we 've made the decision the land will be disposed off because that 's what we 've expressed we want to happen so in the context of all of this yes I think we need to respect that the community boards have got local knowledge they probably know the parcels of land are better than many of us do and they also know you know the areas that the land sits in and they know how it responds to the needs of the area and so on but I would absolutely hate to think that we were making a final decision to dispose of any of these parcels of land without having thoroughly considered every possible use there might be that might bring benefit to our communities so it 's for that reason that I am going to support the resolution the way that it 's put and work on for tof Lake Terrace Road that we find it 's not suitable for social housing in which case a further recommendation will come back once that work has been done to dispose that may end up in the end result of this but at least what we 're not doing is making a decision without considering that first so yeah I will be supporting the resolution as it 's been moved and seconded so I 'll put the motion although is it you 've already spoke put forth separately from a point of order they 're just just as a matter of process I have foreshadowed the motion which is the board recommendation so if you vote against that and and the vote against were to carry it would revert back to the board recommendation in its entirety in the event that this carries Dave what we can do is record your vote against item 4 yep so let 's let 's just do that in the event that this carries as it put will record your vote against item 4 just a question mr. chair I thought always the recommendations so going forward will it not make more sense that if we 're going to vary those that they be an amendment a person can move whatever they want and it was moved and seconded I just think sometimes makes it tricky needs to be put in for separately we 'll put item for separately the easiest ways I 'm in an invidious position there like you 're all separately so I can 't vote both ways I put some item for separately I 'll do that all right so if you want that to be sold you would vote no okay so I 'll put item for first so all those in favor of item 4 please say aye aye against no can the nose please raise their hands 1 2 3 4 5 so that 's carried so now we are voting for items 1 2 3 all those in favor say aye against that 's carried so the effect of that is that the resolution as its port is carried thank you okay hopefully having got some of the bigger issues out of the a little bit more smoothly those who voted against want their names recorded so that was Gulf Galloway East and managing and okay so you 're just gonna take an in person okay okay now let 's move _"

    "text": "okay and last but not least on these community boards reports we have y quarter the limb would Central Heathcoat Community Board and Sally chair of the board welcome to the table this morning good to have you with us looking forward to hearing what you 've got to tell us what to do a variety of things shade for the Scarborough park playground in organ when it 's been built we 've funded a security camera at the corner of Manchester in Aberdeen Street and another two for Linwood village and I mean to see the activators wage and we 're gonna fund publication of photographer the graphic history of an area which is the Victorian neighborhood area so hopefully they 'll produce a lovely big book right you 've seen one about anything local lives and we also got a copy of that for airport so we 're going to give that to one of our local libraries have there and also some football goal posts at Wilson in Edmonds Park we 've got into this time Richmond Hill some that for Tito speed zone and the property few in there that we want to attain we have uses for and we 've also got Jubilee Street and there for you to make a decision on and we 've got a petition it was given to the et committee and and we 're just waiting for your decision on projects in the area and we 're still waiting for the establishment for the inner city East project we 're still waiting for the establishment of the reference group and for this project and this was supposed to be established some time ago I mean it 's four months into it but we still waiting for to faii in we generate to establish that working the reference group and the power volunteer library rebuild the working parties continued to mate oh we 've got the moment continue to make on this and but I 'm always concerned because we sit an email this week about the fight the costings so I would really like the council to report back to her board on this because I feel yet yes this one is it 's all completed to complete this invitation to the opening I think the invitations going out already there had been of this excited about it I 've been again a Scot pack we had a working party on this and we had all the players and there with all the people who have facilities down there but all the clubs and we came we 've come to a pretty good plan for the air and they 've taken it back to their groups and depending on you know what comes back out of the groups we 'll see whether we need a would know their Working Party meeting and otherwise Ben could just rotation in I think we end up it 's quite a nice Park to achieve visit as opposed to just place where you launch boats from so hopefully gonna be a GT and picnic areas and other facilities here people just to enjoy your area public forum we had Rosemary Hall and Deborah talaga from BreastScreen Canterbury they twist our board seeking a suitable site in East Christchurch for breast screening and from their mobile unit is this not actually no pre-screening down closest one is Mira veil or Northwood and that 's we have to go to get done so I 've actually been trying to work with them to get them to get together to try and get a place at least a mall but we are hoping if not we can go back into the Smith Street Park there or somewhere close by to get the unit out there mr. Bruce Stanton is a local isn 't he addressed their board and he had a proposal to enhance accessibility and have a proposed walking and cycling track around the Wolfson cap on the true right bank of his good river and this comes like the very exciting project so if if there was any money around for making a new walking track I think there 's a bit of an informal one there but a proper one will be really great especially of a good includes I think we 're great it would be a really great project to have to put up yeah and Paul McMahon a local resident at least their board regarding environment Canterbury 's draft long-term 5 3 5 which the Westmoreland escape 1 in the East a building okay one um yeah boots used to go back to it can about this and I I did email them about it and I think some counselors have followed up on this as well but I would be really counsel to tone get time with this because this is affecting our most vulnerable communities briefings we received a briefing on the repears and the proposed oat means of the nurses chapel and the rose historic temple probably invitations to and we received the staff briefing on the reakless school transport scheme we also have a research project happening in our area and we 've our governance team has contact contracted an independent social researcher and they want to research about the needs of older adults and grant and greater than what and how what they need to become involved in the community it will also inform the direction of age from the community model and the greater than one area it will commence on the commenced on the 18th of June and we 're going to supposedly in your area we 've got the Big Chill coming up on the seventh of July and I think they 've got date long the UM the winter blast is actually on the 18th of July it 's got the four thumbnails from you so it 's always attended really well by lots of older people in that area the Richmond residents and business association we have a lot of concerns expressed over the state of Richmond and especially the shopping area down at the end where meets it meets north parade and sorry Stanwell Road North Haven Road a bigger pan it meets the north a Monroe and even though the Buster says I 've had a bit of they 've had working bees and I 've been among themselves have been trying to talk to each other to try and get things cleaned out it 's one of those places where there the whole shopping mall is owned by a whole lot of different handled so it 's quite difficult things done we 've just ended but they had an engagement evening at Avebury house on the 15th and Business Association and they 've now had a couple of meetings from that so we 're hoping that you know we can get some wins in that area because it is it 's looking really down and out and so like some help with it and if you haven 't think 8th berry house recently take the opportunity because I think you 've got an invitation to attend do they know from the house in New Zealand block and everything cousins s and coming up soon and it 's on the same street so have it up down there a new house at the same time it 's amazing what they 've got going there the community garden and everything at the back and you 'd be surprised and just to let you know also that we decided that some of our meetings of a community board will be held in the community and we 've had one at Avebury house and we 've had one at Springfield mirai and there next one is going to be a No fantastic thanks Sally for the update just picking up on facility opening lets get those invitations out if we haven 't done already because I think counselors will definitely want to attend that it 's one that we 've been talking about for a long time and it 's good to see their facility finally coming to the final stages and ready for opening and similarly the Rose historic chapel as well so that we can get those dates into our Diaries and then just coming back to the comments that you made on the bus routes I mean obviously the bus routes are a matter but you can rather than for the City Council but that 's not to say the City Council isn 't interested in fact we 've been very concerned about this we we wrote a reasonably strongly worded submission to Eakins long-term plan our hope was that they wouldn 't go ahead and cut those bus routes as they proposed but obviously the outcome of the long-term plan is that they still propose to do that they are going to do that you mentioned in your presentation that um you know you 've obviously had from the effect of affective Ward 's of the city including myself have had some direct engagement where they can as well we remain very concerned about the effects of these cuts I mean obviously it 's the most vulnerable people in our communities that rely on public transport to get to essential services and to keep in contact with friends and family who are going to be most affected by these things my understanding from the latest update is that he and staff are preparing a report which will be presented to their councillors my hope is that that report will land before these cuts take effect I 've actually got a question in that I 'm hoping to get an answer on that and I 'll circulate it when I get their answer that may lead to further engagement we can but we 're doing everything we can to make sure that we get the best possible outcome because we realize how much this is going to affect people that rely on public transport for those essential services and to keep in contact with family and friends so well great now that doesn 't leave us time for questions unfortunately but what I will do is ask for a mover for the report so Yanni will move DeLand will second yep selling mentioned in regards to the walkway along the river that is actually supposed to be part of the industrial rezoning so actually the developers were supposed to do that and obviously it hasn 't been done so it would be really good just to get that cobble we can chase that up independently so yeah I don 't think it 's just a case of us having to find money to do it but maybe there are some maybe very short-term things that we could do with with current staffing arrangements they really got a council could follow that up because it 's quite complex through the whole district plan you mean yeah I mean basically there 's an outline development plan for the kin away farm when it was resigned from really good biodiverse land our farmland to industrial zoning and through the district plan reviewing the community boards head the briefing community board should be that in these council funding because it shouldn 't be done by the developers okay so if you pick that up through the board and of course if there 's anything the board wants to refer through to cancel your babel to do that that 's fine so Yanni Thank You Dion um yeah I just wanted to say based on what you were saying around Richmond Village and Business Association stuff that it was a note and note that I saw a couple of days ago that the post shop has closed down in the Richmond village because they just don 't get customers at the moment and so it is a real struggle with roadworks around that area and and just all the ongoing sort of stresses of that community and sort of just you know making it difficult and just you know just wanted to say that it 's a bit of a sad thing for the POE shop to go that 's going the post services will go into the Benin but you know there is there is a lot of work to do in up and and make that community of vibrant yeah I mean just the state of the alright thank you very much I mean there certainly was something that came through loud and clear and long-term plan submissions and it 's something that I know we 've got a very close eye on that 's a part of town that some certainly needs to continue to be a focus so thank you very much for raising there so this has been moved and seconded all those in favor please say aye against that 's carried so that 's the end of the community board report that brings us neatly to five past eleven we 've got morning tea waiting outside let 's just take ten minutes and come back at 15 and then we 'll get into the parties and the rest of the open agenda so if we can reconvene at 15 place thank you _"

    "text": "very much Sam and Aaron thank you very much indeed for joining us this morning thank you so then moving to holes well Hornby Rickett and Mike Morra welcome to the table good morning pleasure the we 've got the one part a which will come up later we 've got some slides here but we 'll just go through the decisions that we 've made under delegation we 've Rickon recognized a new residents and association in our ward the greater Hornby residents Association and we 've approved tree removals and them in the Hendersons Basin area for the Eastman 's drainage reserve and we a lot of the city are getting near the railway level crossings actually brought up to two standard so that 's the significant projects that we 've got uh some strengthening community funding that 's all starting off again and in the process then we go to Harrington Park toilet is was on schedule of course but a lot of these projects have been held up near with it with inclement weather visit and work is underway we 've been informed so we go and shuttle bombs that 's been going for quite a few years on air community board was as instrumental in getting that set up I did go the last year with to their open day and it was absolutely wonderful absolutely wonderful so that 's that 's a very useful group and facility for for young mums to go with their with their youngsters and have a bit of a chat and chinwag and we 've had done quite a lot of community planting days in their ward too recently so I know that we 're taking out some trees and Henderson 's basin for the Eastman 's but we 're very very proactive as a community to plant more trees so we 've been very busy in the car any drainage Reserve and Wigram and now who know why of course which is their major sports hub as well but putting in more plants around there and and in horse will quarry so it 's really good to see the community getting out at the last the last one they had up in the halls will quarry I think the ice when they were black but planting it in the frost so but the community do get them and behind that and that 's really really good and our community board also last Wednesday wards we see there was seven community service awards and two years of service awards so and that 's something that our community would really rethink it 's been the highlight of all community boards and is the presentation of community service awards but it is it 's lovely to to have the Iranian society the dance group performing for us as well and it just made me think that the different cultures when you can when you have the music of that culture people want to dance and it doesn 't wouldn 't matter what country or what part of the world you actually go to the music starts people dance and it 's just something that we do assume they 're always a doubt from one of my previous logs as well but anyway but it is really really good and the venue that we have for that is the as the Rickett and our community board was part of that restoration team as well there was a tea house restoration trust it was set up at a head members of our community board on earth on that trust as well so if you think back to what that tea house was like when we first laid eyes on it it was virtually demolition material and we 've turned it right back into a into a venue that people are really really pleased to go and visit and so and we go there come on oak enterprise of course we we know that they used to be in record and if you go into Kilmarnock enterprises and see they see the people and see the work they do they 're absolutely lovely bunch of people and they just feel like they 're doing something really really constructive and they are so they 've moved to Wigram near that for over 60 years the Kilmarnock enterprises have been providing occupational therapy and in productive work for people with disabilities so we 're really proud to have their a star group and their Ward and really really interesting I think it 's the first where they 've actually opened the ball up through people to take their pets so it was Easter night it was over 100 pips there mainly dogs but one lone brave bunny rabbit and the bunny rabbit survived the experience which is really good the head of it there in pit behavioral good voice so it 's I think there 's something some pets and animals are all part of our communities are part of our lives and they wonder where we go when we go out to the sittin in the car but anyway they had the opportunity hornbeam all wouldn 't be hub to actually go inside and sniff the meat we 've come up with the work in progress and we 're going to be presented with the were their report on their community community board plan to see how we 're progressing with that and the board is being prepared for when a resource consent applications is lodged in Templeton on a boundary with selwyn that we need to be involved in that process community board the that net space and tomorrow evening at 4 o 'clock we 're on receiving the the hearing penance decision on the reclassification of denton park so that that 's another step in the progress process if hopefully we 'll get there one day but anyway so we 're just looking forward to that step along the way thank you Mike and yeah I mean you 're absolutely right that Denton Park decision is the end of a long process you 've obviously got a hearings panel recommendation that you 're going to be considering and whatever the outcome of that meeting obviously will progress to what needs to happen next to make sure that we get on with the job of planning to build a pool in your part of the city exactly exactly so all the best with that meeting now we do have some time for questions Jimmy next week so engineers counsel engineers and the communities engineers are meeting tomorrow and so tomorrow the group has hit six months to report back and that it 's it 's happening tomorrow so at the moment the oldest hall the community have asked for some more time for that to be considered so tomorrow both engineers will go through then there 'll be a recommendation back through the board to council Association each year they mention one day before it comes out being there but post-party not any key to open I got the key and he will be there tomorrow I would I would have to say thank you know that the group has had money for an engineer for six months and if only just engage an engineer now so that has put stuff in a very difficult position okay thank you thank you okay so Jimmy would like to move who would like to second Vicki would like to submit no good question I said something no just by way of addition you sure could you talked about the removal of hundred-and-something trees in the Eastman urea but you didn 't mention that they were actually planting twelve and a half thousand native trees in three hundred thousand native plants in the area and that the community board actually also added at least five hundred edibles one of those that we 've done recently and so the amount of native trees and edibles being planted in that part of Christchurch and stormwater reserve areas is actually phenomenal and the staff were doing an incredible job of redoing that sorry it wasn 't the question it was this I 'm great thank you thanks for adding that let 's prevent you great alright so Jimmy 's moved Vicki oh you have a second yep great so moved and seconded all those in favor please say aye against that 's carried thank you and thanks Mike for your update good to see you back okay

    "text": "so moving on now to item 9 Felton Harewood and welcome to the obviously we 've exercised our delegated authority and no stopping restrictions discretion your response funding you see development funding and we 've installed some no over taking road markings on Glenn Dobie Road so it 's always good just to bring them to your attention and we 've got two parties today and Aaron will touch on one of them soon but the other one I just wanted to briefly mention now obviously with the format changing this is a property review process so the board initially had that information come to our staff we knowwe ended quite a bit of work around it and it came back that effectively the land that we 've mentioned was surplus to requirements as so we 've in our view you know we 'd really appreciate your supporting a recommendation today to move that forward and work through from now the other couple of things I just wanted to touch on before I hand over to Aaron is obviously just to update you on the jelly pie recreation and SportsCenter and is progressing with that the outdoor pool and high just like work sort of working through at the moment so that 's really effective secondly and one that will potentially come back to you late August early September as around the G freeze reserve replacement some suction tank and you might recall there 's been a wee bit of coverage around there that 's just been pushed back a wee bit more staff go and do some work so we 're confident we 'll get a good outcome the effort everybody so Aaron I might pass over to you to just touch on the next thank you regarding speed limit changes this is item 18 on your agenda today so regarding this speed limit change and he would on the 5th of June the board received a deputation from Julie Greenwood the principal of here with school regarding the proposed speed limit changes on he would rope the board recommending to council that the speed limit in he would Road outside the school here be reduced to 50 kilometers an hour rather than the staff recommended 60 kilometres an parents crossing the road in the vicinity of the school a further consideration we are asking is that council will write to the Minister of Transport seeking the ability of schools throughout the city to be able to manually adjust the speed limit timings of schools to meet any changes in the school day due to the proximities due to the proximity of vehicles that are going past schools might be a sports day for example where the break time or the gathering time will have a number of pedestrians outside of schools therefore it would be wise to have more traffic signalling regarding the safety of that to be considered the board is recommending also that the section of guys Road from Ryan 's rope to School Road those of you from other areas of the tend quite familiar with this be reduced to 60 kilometers an hour rather than 80 kilometres an hour to deter heavy vehicles from using the road so in that area there are a number of queries quarry trucks should be using Ryan 's Road if they come down guys Road they should be at this stage there 's a lot of construction and rolleston and there 's a strong desire line for drivers of these quarry trucks to go down guys on to school and in newsdesk it 's wrote the that section of guys roads schools and Hesketh Road is quite narrow I was out there with the resident it 's very narrow there are signs that you can see where vehicles have crossed onto the the grass eaters it 's not basically this is hopefully going to encourage drivers to use that the old motor type might a teen building has been sold for some time positively and on the regeneration of the area local community government governance staff and DCL have been meeting with residents to provide them with an opportunity to sheerly thoughts on what is needed to help rena chain regenerate the mall area the notice was funded by the previous community board a few years ago and was located it 's been in storage since the building was demolished and the manager should down new world has now given permission for it to be installed on the area for traffic area so it 's really good that that can be done the bishop domain she has helped out by installing that for us and the Fisher Dale Community Trust which is on Farrington Street just very close to it it looks like a notice board and regularly updates it with information and community services and one of the highlights we 've had in more recent times is the community service awards so we had eleven members of our local community receive a community service award on Tuesday and we held that out of the bishop library and the new sort of function Marin via and for anyone that hasn 't been along it 's well worth going out and use going out and having a look at its well patronized and it certainly fully booked up most of the time and evident even on Tuesday night that we had to be out by a certain time to keep renting that out so it 's a really good AC in our community overhead Matthew Mark from the City Mission come along as a guest speaker and he gave think the the takeaway from these awards was the real pride that everyone talking and their service in the commune so it 's a really nice part of the job for us and I yeah it was fantastic so that 's one aspect and the second that I just wanted to close on the group of the month so this month we have identified the 7 youth workers at Burnside High School and you 'll see in the budget deal we 've got Josh Josh from the team I 've known Josh for many many years and he 's an exceptional guy with a great nature and I think that 's sort of evident in the work that him and the team are doing there so a wonderful organization we just always like to bring them to your attention as well so that 's it from us we 'll obviously have more next month around the Jefferies tank and a couple of other issues that are brewing and that will keep you informed in due course that 's great thank you very much now just coming back to that part changes at the Haywood Road and guys Road and relating to the adjustment to school zone timings what exactly was it that you were looking at as a board there to write to the minister transfer and indicate that we think that schools and we know place outside obviously the perimeters have the ability to make some form of adjustment with that 's true and you know the local organization or what have you we just felt that when Julie Greenwood from here would school came along and she identified that you know there were times of the day where it actually would be really useful whether it 's the preschool next door that they could have that on for 20 minutes or 25 minutes and that she had absolutely no control at the moment to do there so we thought it was something that 's worth investigating with the minister so it would really encourage you to support them and write on behalf of the organization alright thanks for that clarification okay so we 've got some time for questions Aaron Dion Jimmy what we were made aware of zone speed changes the temporary ones before TK they are time a seat and you can 't adjust it so if your school 's leaving early it might be a 40 k zone if you 're breaking it to a block for whatever reason if there 's a school tournament on if you 're gonna go for a swim down the road it doesn 't come on and so which we thought was really odd we 've we thought the schools could adjust them for whenever they needed them and if I had visiting groups whatever or a preschool next door that might be crossing whatever the need may be so we thought in its government legislation that control set which is very odd so we thought there is a council we should be writing to say hey look here 's a problem in the system can it be changed to allow schools to choose when they would adjust their times okay let 's pick that up when we deal with the Part A that certainly the point has been well made twice just in this last conversation so let I 'm that 's great Dion let 's just go I just wanted to say thanks for the progress report against the Community Board plan I mean actually including that in there because it 's really good to get an update on those things because we all owe transparency and accountability it 's great we 've all spend a lot of time building those things I actually just say thanks to your staff as well for before actually putting accountable measures in there in action progresses Thank You Jimmy timeframe for those the upgrade and also the residence of people to use these facility so it 's a staged process that let 's sort of rebuild so I 'm happy to get more detailed information to flip through by email guys and but what they 've done the Vic that else I 've been really good about it and I 've managed that to minimize the impact on residents so he shouldn 't be any issue there but look we 'll get some detail and flipped onto you because I be kind of oh well it 's probably a good in our community we could get some information around everyone so that they 're fully aware of those timelines you yeah a second question Chopra fridge we got into a pizza there more reach energy generation who owned this well it 's a funny one and that I think the council owns the land or the public areas but that the buildings are owned privately so and you 're not sure this probably not the right one to to mention who 's just bought wider comes for take a lead thank you thank you very much and thanks very much indeed for the presentation and the update from the board that 's great so we 've got a recommendation once again to receive the community board report which Jamie is happy to move and Aaron 's happy to second all those in favor please say aye against that 's carried _"

    "text": "so moving on item 8 Pappa nuit in this alley chair of the board welcome to the table good to have you with us this morning comments were just heard around the age study and the next steps we 're doing exactly that is the next step to our research that we 've done in our ward and that is to look at how we can improve mainly city council areas because that 's where we 've got a bit of control over but also more widely as well how we can perhaps advise on other public spaces according to what we 've found on the research so yes that is a natural step it might be a good idea actually if boards can connect on that so we 're removing the potential of any site owing and there might be things that we can learn from each other as well in that respect not too much in this report we 've got one part a which relates to the 50 kilometer an hour speed zone on the Cranford street in main North Road area the second part a was upgrade which was around the proposed road layout the options were presented to the board but they were laid on the table for further discussion and questions pending a seminar which we had yesterday so that will probably come to the next meeting and that we 've got the other issues in the ward at the moment that I would like to bring up one is the polyphony voice exhibition which is an amazing involvement from young people in our Ward and the artistic interpretation of how they give themselves a voice there was I remember one from last year in fact I she know it 's from this year and it 's the left bear and I think the word is manners and just amazing and girls and boys actually so there 's a really nice even split and this is a project undertaken with Otto Howe and we support this as well it 's a partnership and this now looks as though it 's going to be run out across the whole city and libraries around the city so we think that 's a very positive thing to young people at Papa Nui hi papa Nui Youth Development Trust Papa Nui Baptist Church to auda ho Oh tone tahi take Oh Papa order and case Brooke Intermediate so it 's got a really wide reach around the ward the San Albans Amateur Swimming and life-saving Club well we 're getting a bit cool for that now so they have had another very successful season started with a family swim and barbecue and Swim Club volunteers opened the pool on Fridays during December and January and there was huge pickup the club had four swim coaches and they 'd attracted around 50 children and their families and the usual triathlon and family barbecue swim and prize-giving was held at the end of the season and all the children received progress certificates and trophies in recognition of exceptional success so the swimming life-saving and learn to swim programs are in great health in this part of our Ward additional planting at Bridgestone Reserve this was the second part of our planting and that was held on Tuesday the 5th of June yeah I know I know there was some weird 've got board member John stringer and Deputy Chair in menorah SH and we thank them for braving the weather and their gumboots you would not have been out of place in a canoe to be honest there was quite a lot of water around so that 's the next stage now with that is to focus on the frontage of the reserve and conversations have commenced with local area around a carving to be completed for the frontage of it so that 's a really positive successful project and our ward the Suburbans pavilion this is on time and on budget I understand and will in fact be finished ahead of the greens so we are hoping or the the park that 's being done and because of the gap and there we would like to we 're looking at opening having an opening celebration otherwise it 's going to be several months because of the wet weather that we 've had the completion of the earth works on the grass as you 'll see has been held up so the community has been really engaged and involved in in the immediate area so they know what 's going on and we 've had storyboards up on the fences around making clear what the project is doing as well so there 's there 's much anticipation this is one of the best used parks in sporting facilities in our Ward and it has been unable to be used for the last seven years so nearly eight years now but farlan park center that is coming along the Landscaping 's been completed the new junior play equipment and play area and the keys to the center were headed to the Shirley Community Trust in the middle of June and they 're planning an opening event coming up soon so I also ought to mention the work that staff are doing which is incredibly detailed and time-consuming but very rewarding as well with the Dudley Creek and San Albans stream flood remediation project affecting a large number of residents in the richmond shirley area something that Joe Byrne board member has organized which was really lovely was because we 've got a community that is being negatively affected by the roadworks and they 're not seeing the positive results of the work because it 's actually for the dudley stream and and the flop turn basin people who are by the way that 's working very well we haven 't had any flooding each time that 's being used so Joe organized letters from the flocked and basin people thanking those in the richmond shirley area for having for putting up with all of this disruption and explaining what an incredible life change it 's meant to have the the pumps working in their area and so that community to community support actually made a really big difference it wasn 't elected members or staff telling the communities that it was the community 's telling each other they 're my thing that made a big difference and that really is about it we are keeping the community in Richmond Shirley well up with what the plans are as the works complete and plant starts to move out of the area there are two areas there to intend Shirley Road and the former Anglican living site at 40 guild Street and so the remediation plans are for that and been assured that they will be left in and as good hopefully better condition once staff Lee great thank you very much indeed Ally for that update neighborhood trusts have a partnership with Kathleen Liberty who you will be aware of doing the post-earthquake they are producing some videos and they have enlisted the help of Diane woods which you know reasonably high profile New Zealand certainly pretty if you will who has agreed to a very reasonable rate to voice these videos and they are going to produce these very very cheaply I know how much it costs to produce these videos and it 's just a drop in the bucket and they will be produced to inform parents and communities on how to best manage and deal with stressed and anxious children and it 's based on Kathleen Liberty 's research so we think that 's a very positive project that 's great thank you very much and good to have the update on McFarlane Park good to hear that the keys have been handed over the community I remember been the partnership project between the council the Lions and the local community very much involved as well so it 's good to see that on progressing in such a good way excellent so thanks for the update are there any questions for early this morning great thank you for that yawning obviously the park and the pavilion are gonna be really well used assets in the local community just mindful of the information that our boards had throw around the northern tier extinctions and is there a parking plan for how people were going to park in that area that 's being done welcomes it 's a part of the consultation at the moment so some of the feedback we received in the consultation which the process is still in play was community concerns about the parking around this so those concerns will inform the consultation and the subsequent plan around us right but just in terms of the park itself is there any sort of light demand assessment in terms of provision of parking whether it 's adequate or not I mean I just think would be a shame because there 's no no no no no you can 't_''_561.15 at the moment there is parking down it would ever which is not going to be as far as I understand effect the issues around the downstream because it 's the Barbados in Warrenton sort of all the Barbados side that 's going to be more of an issue yeah so the parking down aid would have but I mean I don 't want to say any more on that at the moment cuz it is still part of a consultation process so any assessment of the demand of the park and the need for parking will be a part of the final I just wanted to check if it owner of the park is looking at making submissions or putting the views forward around the needs of the park in the pavilion yeah it 's from a community board perspective them from a staff recommendation perspective yes as I said it 's one of the best use parts and in the ward and the city yeah great thank you very much so and that brings us to the indeed Ali for a very full update from your part of the city so we have a recommendation to receive the report which Pauline would like to move and Mike I 'm assuming you 'd like second all those in favor please say aye against that 's carried thank you very much _"

    "text": "so the next Community Board why Horo sprayed in Kashmir so Melanie deputy chair of the board welcome to the table this morning looking forward to hearing what you 've got to tell us about the work of your board so this thing was extremely sprayed in Kashmir so is part of community will planned we agreed to do an age-friendly kind of initiative within in Kashmir so we 've had a steering group that has been working away for about probably six months the Simpson and the whole aim now and they were part of their two new board members and then yesterday we had the launch weeks so there was a really large attendance from lots of older adults and a few for myself and it was really good and we hit some workshops there was some presentations in base what 's coming out of it asking for nominations for a wicking party that will come up with ideas and with the community to come up with different things that we can do to make ageing and spray-tan Kashmir a good thing and it 's an initiative there of them across the country but she say 600 I think so it 's sort of a pilot I guess in Christchurch but we 're looking forward to seeing how it runs we haven 't got any photos but we might do needs time maybe the second thing I 've got has just been launched its called local lives of history of bored areas but it 's something that was started 14 years ago in the Edington Neighborhood Association decided that they shall have a history written down because well I was told at this lon because Pendleton had one so why can 't they so Nancy that was gonna take a look a lot longer than what they expected for John Wilson to write it but it 's very very beautiful book as you can see was fooled with pictures all the way through it and it 's a really rich history spreading community boards mentioned a lot of those photos that really we communed it 's gonna go into the libraries but it 's only been probably 50 now it was 40 30 50 if you want to lots of things from here and it does hit me I won 't but it does mention that the worries about for lining down Lincoln Road so page 275 but we should definitely get a copy um what was next yeah Canterbury resettlement services so Carolyn organized a meeting for our board to go to visit them their best in Eddington she used to be on their board as well they 've been around for thirty years and we were there for well over an hour meeting with him basically what they do is they help refugees resettle in Christchurch basically and they have lots of diverse communities and they have lots of a lot of this staffer from different communities as well like we meet people that have been in refugee camps for I can 't remember in like twenty years that kind of thing and it finally made it to New Zealand and and of course were offering to help people who were coming to New Zealand as well so um in shooty bright as the manager I think of that so um yeah anyway it was a so um mention it and the last thing I wanted to mention was about how we gave from our in your plan last year we gave 45,000 which was a huge amount to the predator-free port hills which is partly umbrella Gondor I guess the the peace free beings peninsula that Pam was talking about I guess I 've got a conflict of interest because I 'm on the summer it 's part of the Summit Road society it sort of it within that and I 'm on the steering group for there as well decision making but you know there will be photos coming with we had that just yesterday we we presented a cheek that yeah that the staff had made and during a guy whose idea was the whole thing he was very proud to be holding there for about ten minutes so we 'll show you photos of there next time but we 're very very pleased what seemed to be working towards so what it is us so it 's a backyard trapping project so they 've already got I can 't make me how single suburb across the entire port hills including going around into Governors Bay and those coordinators manage volunteers who do trapping within their own backyards and the idea is to collect data on what they 're what they 're trapping use the money to you know so the money will go towards an administrator as well to oversee everything cuz it 's a whole lot of people involves us keeping tabs on everything great Thank You Melanie and talking to the summit Road society I was at their midwinter dinner on Saturday night about the sign of the Kiwi and right on the border of Banks Peninsula and Kashmir of course but some yeah that was a good opportunity to hear about some of the amazing work that Summit Road Society have been doing they were blown away when they had the phone call from our governance manager he thought there was a couple too many zeros on that amount so he 's excellent that 's a really good outcome fantastic so we do have some time for questions if there are any questions for Melanie Vickie and just the refugees to be now resettle done to Canterbury or should we be doing that as council I don 't know the answers of it I 'm just wondering would it be sensible if we asked for because we haven 't had them had resettlement into Christchurch no seven years yeah I think we 're I think we probably would agree that we 're really for it and would love to have it love to have it coming back into Christchurch I 'm just not sure what committee we should ask no my understanding is that the mayor wrote a letter to the Minister some time ago so if you might be good to get an update on what the result was from there and then once we found that out maybe there 's something that could be referred to Phil 's committee I imagine it would be well maybe we can get an update on what the outcome from the letter was in the work that Claire 's doing if there 's something that needs to come to a committee then we could certainly look at that I mean maybe work that clay is doing would be and where that would land with with governor 's and which committee would best come yep great thank you I 'm Phil your question just a comment in relation to commend the board really for the the age-friendly project Melanie and it 's very timely and that it 's a pilot and will be interesting to see the outcomes of there but what I 'm just wondering might be useful for the project too is that certainly we 've seen data indicating population projections not just the baby boomers but in fact the increase in the aging population and just how all that is managed but particularly for when people for example a large number of going to be on low incomes and needs a single accommodation and just how we manage that in terms of for example social housing so I 'm just wondering if somehow we can make sure those stats which have have come to some of the committee 's any way that we make sure the board get get those presentation thank you great Thank You Jimmy and finally from the age-friendly it 's a lot of things I think we 've got to look at they 're being used like and we 've done Phil 's leading on the retreats that we had from reason with regards to the disability parking library where people who are fed as fiddles Park in the and in bugger off and we are limited to what we can do so I think that we 've got look at their facilities in Phil and I talked about how we can talk to libraries about expanding the number of disability parks because the the polite number is no longer the required number it 's actually bigger than it different colors all over the place you know and different malls that sit rented it you know I think it 's two things one we 've actually got to supply but we can talk about this but I think that 's certainly a discussion we need to have but be following on from the work that Melanie and Lee are doing thank you yeah there are two conversations that need to be continued and I think enforcement of use of disability parks council facilities and using this as an example and the other of which is the issue of the blue disability car parks and that 's a discussion that we 've had a number of times before and he 'll be good to pick that up again as well all right so that 's all the time that we 've got for questions for for your board but Melanie thanks very much indeed for the presentation Phil you 're happy to move this Tim I 'm assuming you 're happy to second that 's all time we 've got for questions for this board so I 'll put the motion all those in favor please say aye against that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "Tuukka or rakaia who thanks peninsula pam welcome to the table could I just say apologies from Jonah 's morning but I have got a fine young lady giving me a hand this morning so Joe thank you very much I 'd also like to say that I was actually a member of the earthquake appeal trust that allocated that 15 million dollars to that particular project I have just been listening very quietly behind the scenes over the years as to where that might have gone and how it was being used but it was part of the funds that we allocated quite some time ago now so it 's good to see it still wears got more money to it and is going to be put twice huge down the track it was we 're gonna get some information to the board so that they can be involved and as they 're able to be seen making sure we get some good outcomes all right that 's great so Pam Banks Peninsula right to be here this morning and we 're talking about company community services award buildings of other things that I would like to bring up so but the first one is about the long term plan now we have the note no notes there oh well I like to use my notes here and but I just really just wanted to make a comment that acknowledged the extraordinary amount of work by all the parties involved you know both the council staff our communities and those that capped off part of the process there are unbelievable pressures and we need to understand the complexities of the process but we need to also understand the role of the community and the importance of our community whether focus on the ratepayer and I and I really want to raise even further the role of partnerships in our community and that we can all do our little but whether it is a dr. Colvard it will sweep a foot path or whatever it might be we need to do a little bit to help us along the way so and we 've got a number of community working groups that have new community means working group so I went into that process over the time this next one is about our community services award and we do ours every three years across the peninsula were actually at Chi tuna an amazing venue for a gathering there was a special early award to Christine Wilson that we made prior to this this day but it was a standing day and what a range of skills in our community from a musician you can 't actually just see them then it 's got effect on what 's hip there you know from those involved with community groups championing communities groups there 's thousands of hours of service there and I just really also want to acknowledge the support of our staff the banks of initiative community board staff that assisted with putting this day together Meredith Williams who is actually retiring today completed her to turn a contract short-term contract as leaving us and going overseas or coming or going back home again but her support of the stay was was amazing and the governance team that did the background work so we had an amazing session together now the we had a visit in an update now so it was absolutely wonderful to go back down there and see the progress that 's being made down there but it was also a good reminder to remember what is what is still happening than the port the port is are still in dire straits the wolves are looking and disrepair but there 's some amazing new buildings there and we had an opportunity to meet the meet Athiya office so it 's an important opportunity to meet with the CEO and keeping in touch with progress understanding the issues and showing that us that we as a community can actually work with them and assist them along the way and so we 're just looking at improving those relationships and we continue to remind the little port company of the importance of our community and how much they very having the port there too so this is a pets of you that you may not it may not see often but it 's some that came from one of the many if you notice an eminence that there 's many we have long lists of them and this is from the buildings that community you need to go for a drive down there sometime see this amazing space and what was provided down there now it 's a it 's a place to be but they 're also the community came with us with us concern about the lighting that 's down there and that they don 't want to see bright for the area lights they want to be a little bit like tekapo so we 're just asking that if there is any work being done down there that they actually talk with the building 's community before they actually go and design things that if it 's either for safety for no walking or road safety or anything that they actually talk with the building 's community first before they take off and do anything they 're very proactive community and they want to be involved now this one this is a project that I 've especially wanted to talk about because it 's been very successful and I think that this is how we could be the significant ecological projects ecological sites that we 're moving into a process now but this little house in Littleton is an amazing house at 75 David Street stone building built in the 1860s and it was severely earthquake damaged and uninhabitable so the owners have rescued and restored it but the important part of it and I want to acknowledge the work of the staff this particular family didn 't know that this was a heritage building no one had said didn 't think about I don 't know how they didn 't know about it being heritage but they knew it was important but the Burnitz Myer Brendan Smith rang the family and said hey look are you aware and that you 've got a responsibility to repair it and that was the start of a long journey and they 've had a wonderful working relationship with the council and the staff that has worked tremendously well they 've had funding from all sorts of organizations that they were nominated for a heritage Ward it 's not completed yet that 's a bit early but somebody nominated them so I just wanted to meet you in a couple of other things that are urn and those notes there in there is--there on page 13 a mention of the Advisory 6.13 in the adopting of the era of public realm design guidelines as you all should know echo is a very special area it 's historic it 's got a site designations on it and we 've got public realm guidelines that go with it that have never been completed they 've been in the pipeline for a long time they 're sort of like your infrastructure standards that when you come to a Caro you might look as a look at those along with the public realm guidelines and we would just like to support to finish those and the other thing that I wanted to bring up from our notes was the peace free Banks Peninsula and that 's mentioned on the back page of our our report page item number six page 14 and that piece free it 's it 's between a number of parties to work collaboratively towards achieving effectively peace free status events been working behind the scenes and now looking to get an MOU signed off between the the Christchurch City Council and this particular group the group has made up a range of people Environment Canterbury Department of Conservation I think the link here might be there as well there 's a number of experts there that are working to get this over the line and they 're coming to the infrastructure and transport Environment Committee on the 11th of July and hopefully that will that the Beck committee will agree to and the board is supportive of a recommend that committee enters into the memory MOU and nominates two councillors including deputy mayor to sign off on behalf of the council and there 's public that proposed to be a public signing event later in September so that 's something that 's coming to that particular committee the board is very supportive of this concept July but I haven 't been involved with it but aware of what 's going on so there we are there 's a snapshot from from Batesville Angela thank you very much indeed Pam for questions are there any questions for Pam this morning no questions great just coming back to the burnings flat matter yes that was particularly relating to replacing the existing street lamps with LEDs and also the possibility of reducing some of the street lamps in buidlings flat to reduce light pollution wasn 't it yeah great all right thanks for those updates so we 've got a resolution in front of us to receive the community board report which I 'm happy to move Dion 's happy to second all those in favor say aye against that 's carried thank you very much thanks Pam _"

    "text": "and now we move to the next part of our meeting which is receiving reports from our community boards and the first of those is the white high coastal Burwood Community Board so Kim money and chair of the board welcome to the table we look forward to your with me there is a part that you 'll be considering this morning and the border I 'm actually on board with it right as you can see on the reports before you oh it 's good it was a good so as you can see in your port before you that you have in your screens you 'll see that we have contributed some funding towards certain community groups which is always really great to be able to do I 'm just highlight one of them was the Perkins bowling club we go donated them some money towards the communications marketing and stakeholder engagement plan it 's real privilege for the board to do this to be able for them to be able to progress implementing their stage two because this community organization as a collaboration as I 've told the collaboration between the bowls in the Rugby Club there so that 's real privilege to be able to just help this community get have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to be able to do progress their project the second thing we have here is that we had a briefing from the land information New Zealand to the board it was a really good meeting the community board just wanted to have a bit of knowledge on the process of the transitional use of the red zone so limbs came and they went through that process and as you can see up on this one you can 't really see Kenya there 's there 's a few transitional projects already in place you can see just dotted around there and one of the most recent ones is there 's a mobile skate rink that has been added so that was good to have to understand that this was fantastic this is the New Brighton Lions Club coastal build community board and they came and approached the development Christ ships and community board and wanted to donate a couple of a bit of an unveiling a week or two ago we had the governance board from the Lions Club the New Brighton Lions Club we had development Christchurch who Celia there was talking a lot of the organization excuse me pulling it all together we also had pure and forceful represented then you 're both longboarders and also the people that Apollo outdoor furniture who actually made them and we also needed to give thanks to Coast cube team and the council part staff for not just getting on board and making things happen and also Mike downs contracting who install nothing isn 't that a beautiful spot can 't_''_196.2 you see yourself sitting on them so that was really nice something to enhance their portion for the community to enjoy QT master plan this is still a process so from the wonderful community day to their staff had organized we have now got collated all the information back the board have had a workshop workshop with the staff and so now they 're developing a draft master plan including the vision for the park so this will take probably a minimum about eight weeks and the project team are working towards having the consultation before the dump before the end of the year so there 's another really good exciting project to be completed running and conjunction with the opening of the QT facility so then we have resource consent workshop is of seen many times when I 've come here to the board you 've got some issues with the high flood hazard management area so in our ward but also central haircut this is affecting their community as well so we 're having a joint workshop with them and staff on the 13th of August to get more understanding on this for residents same picture the Burwood East residents Association had raised concerns a feeling about marginalized there 's some issues there on the perimeters of the red zone the activities that are going on that they would like to happen for example so it sort of stretches right through from roading issues to doing the transitional use of the land and just being sort of in the loop so we 're going to have an on-site they 're talking about with them the other thing that 's I think we 're not quite be the only thing that 's opening in the regeneration I had the question in a regeneration Christchurch limited is opening a hub and South Shore and South New Brighton to talk about the future coastal hazards and sea level rise with these two communities it 's it 's I would call it a bit of a pilot scheme this is the how team engagements of the VEX you 've got an office down there so the community can come and go and and talk about these things also not really to do with the council but very much to do with a community board that affects our community as the ministry announced the zoning is you 'll all be aware of for the two schools inside this unit boys high school so the majority of our community is very pleased but this outcome but they 're not so we 're just gonna is a board keep that conversation going with the Ministry of Education as they review their boundaries over the years exciting this is Gruffalo okay and the week qgb I don 't have a name she is cute and so as part this is Gruffalo Explorer and as part of the breeze walking festival event at Bali forest this event was recognised as the best national event and therefore a winner and the national golden foot prize for a community led project at the Living Streets so this was really exciting but this couldn 't have happened without the involvement and I 'm gonna read them out st. margaret 's college the Canterbury place Interest OCA ssin Canterbury Plunkett and the Christchurch parks library and community recreational teams in their own hunt and characters sort of students they dressed in character from The Gruffalo and they place themselves around Bothell Lake so the kids were finding them and as they did they sort of gave them a little bit of an education but graph our deal whirring he took it one step further because he offered the children and whoo-hoo grub to eat and if they didn 't take up that challenge he ate it in front of them himself half thousand participants that morning mostly their preschoolers with their grandparents so that is absolutely a wonderful result in congratulations everybody involved so thank you it 's mine that 's great thank you very much and that does leave a little bit of time for questions are there any questions from counselors so Vicky and then gling Vicky to questions thanks for the information about the lens in their transitional use of the red zone I 'm just going through the form on online that you apply through but is there a person that you can talk to yes a couple people here are some names would be really report let 's do some names that we can actually publicize so that people who have ideas can contact them because just just to form is slightly impersonal great the second part the now seventeen and a half million dollar fund that sits with internal fears on there for the residential read zone have you talked to regenerate about it and how people may exist that a seventeen and a half million there fifteen million I understand there 's now seventeen 's an offline conversation we can have about that so that you are aware of any opportunities that might exist and have a think about how you might engage the community in that that 's some useful good outcome as I understand it but as I understand it it 's worked through region alright so let 's get some information to you as the board chair so that you can find out what there is what it 's the amount for and what influence you might have on how it 's used that 's that 's a good outcome excellent Glenn comment so did you want those now or at the end of the go okay all right couple comments seen I think it 's through dia that on anyway there with the residential red zone we 're in a totally new space including I think for lens so we 're initiating a meeting with all the agencies to try and get things off on a better footing because residents around their bill would even side and Ellington are being cut out of the equation so a lot of agencies the residence box isn 't being ticked and so we need to keep people together that 's what we 're doing there so that we get greater ownership over the school zones the ministry decided to give the original feeder school designs a 13 year period by which their children can go to school my thinking on this is why not make it permanent if it can be 13 years let 's make it permanent so it 's half a win but we still need to take it further over there it 's good that you know we pushed back and got that result but we need to take it much further yeah my understanding is there 's been an offer of engagement or there 's been a reasonable level of engagement between the ministry and your board yep good it 's just good excellent yep and of course Preston 's misses out there are some role reviews coming up and we 'll see whether we can progress that as well yep great all right thank you so Glen you 're happy to move this okay David you 're wanting and seconded to receive the community board report all those in favor say aye against that 's carried great thanks Ken very much indeed for your presentation this morning thank you _"

    "text": "participation item three on the agenda and I 'm pleased to welcome Lachlan John 's to the table Lachlan is a year nine students at st. Andrew 's College and he 's going to speak to us this morning regarding his views on the stadium so Lachlan if you 'd like to come up to the table please welcome and we 're looking forward to hearing what you 've got to tell us today thank you for letting me come in here to speak speak to you and all the councillors for taking the time to listen to my proposal Thank You councillor queuing for having the time to read my letter on the thoughts of the new stadium the new stadium will provide a hub for the people of Christchurch to go and enjoy being a Cantabrian the stadium will let us have many things that Christchurch hasn 't had since the earthquake and it will also give us many things such as concerts festivals and me and maybe even some football games that we didn 't have before the proposal that I made to council kilm was that digital will mean that there will be lights that will be fit there will not be fixing the same in the same position you will be able to bluetooth your phone into the services that will be provided having this device will let people replay the game that they will be watching at the time up back up to five minutes this will allow people some of the comforts that we get at home we were allowed to have them at the game today you will also be able to check out some people steps that you can see on the screen at home you 'll be able to see how many how much time the tackles have made or how many running meters they 've had people often say that the best seat in the house is your couch because you because you can see every part of the game at once with the Bluetooth services that will be provided with the cheer you will be able to you 'll be able to switch in between a camera that will be close to the action if you cannot see a pole or something that is in the way of your viewing point there will also be an option as we all have phones there will also be an audio jet will you be able to listen in to what is being said on the field between the ref and the captain 's and also what is being said with the commentators this will allow people to understand the game more than if they would just have been sitting there and watching it obviously if if you pay more for a seat you get better quality services from the Bluetooth devices that would mean you 'll be able to replay much further back so if you went to go get a drink way to go the toilet you 'll be able to catch up on with the play there will also be a feature where you can check out you you can make the own decision for yourself with the team are you reacting as yourself as a team oh and you 'll be they sometimes will be a voting system for the public to be able to vote whether obviously this won 't carry yet this won 't carry through the team or that 's the weather ultimate decision also advertising would be will be brought up because you 'll be able to have one-on-one advertising with that person that you see at the moment instead of having broad advertising that you just see on the screen down on the field I think that this will be very very important because the world is we 're moving toward digital and people will be drawn in to keep coming and watching people in real life if we see if there 's that element of more enjoyment and better quality than we have at the moment the stadium itself will be an absolute joy for everyone in my generation be able to come back and see many range of sporting events and it 'll be awesome that to have some more all black tests and will be able to see some of the people that we haven 't done see in a while we 'll come to hometown which will be awesome do you guys have any questions thank you very rule about this some public participation parties that that doesn 't allow for questions but your presentation has been a perfect example of why we need to be absolutely listening to young people we talked about Christchurch as a city of opportunity where anything can happen where we have new ways of doing things and what you 've talked about yes has got an eye on the future but actually it 's got a very keen eye on what is possible today so thank you very much indeed for presenting that to us I actually think what we should do and I 've got a copy of your letter to Erin Keon here I think we should refer this through to the stadium project team so that they can take your comments into account and it may well be that if somebody working on that team wanted to ask some questions or wanted some further information they would be able to come back to you and have that conversation so that you can have some real input where it really can make a difference so thank you very much indeed to us today I think it 's a perfect example of how we can be listening to the ideas of all our community but young people in particular and making sure that they influence what really can be good outcomes for the city so thank you very much so deputations by appointment there are none presentation of petitions there are none _"

January to 31st of March 2018 and Ivan and Jason through the finance and performance committing are there any remarks that you wanted to make about this report as we move into the discussion today in the report so as most of you will be aware we launched the redzone futures exhibition on the 26th of May it has been open for almost five weeks and it closes this week on Saturday it 's an opportunity for people to give us feedback on the reforms list that the board decided in April to date we 've had over 7,000 people who have come to the central exhibition in provide us with feedback generally overwhelming support for the proposal induces in particular the green spine and the users included within the Greens we 've also had a traveling exhibition which has gone to shopping malls council libraries and service centers in sports fields and that is right up until this week and in addition we 've held a number of workshops with groups within the population that aren 't generally well represented in public engagement once the engagement closes this week on Saturday will then be assessing all of the feedback forms and will be presenting that to the board for them to make a decision on the final set of land users before the planners seems to 1629 parties including the council for you to provide formal feedback and comment in terms of moving to phase 2 of developing a regeneration strategy for South Shore and south will brighten as the following a recent presentation that councillors received from the Houghton and regenerate Christchurch and council staff we are now moving to phase 2 which includes establishing a physical presence within South Shore and Southie Brighton to provide an opportunity for people to drop in to have conversations to access information ahead of implementing the engagement plan that was developed by the housing and that 'll be starting within the next couple of weeks recently we published the vision for Cathedral Square it had a lot of response really interesting responses from different parts of the community and we 're now going to be working with council staff to develop delivery strategy to look at what can be delivered in we finally we are finalizing the advice to provide to today is the Thursday before the end of June so we can you provide this to you by the end of the week which evaluates progress in the Central City and provides an advice for the council and for the crown to consider in terms of increasing momentum within the central city the board was very pleased to receive from the council a draft proposal for the use of powers under Section 71 of the greater Christchurch regeneration act to enable the development of a sports facility in your test region re Christchurch provided us views on that and looks forward to receiving it from the council once it 's been canceled unloads views have been considered by the council I understand in September so that 's a brief overview of highlights I guess you could say since the report was table we happy to take questions thank you are there any questions for Ivan Aaron and then Yanni received emails Ivan around the East Lake proposal that group and then of course they 've done their proposal so the question would be is there any consideration given that feedback that 's what we are doing at the moment is seeking feedback on the refine shortlist that has been published the intention is to consider all of the feedback and then the board will make a subsequent decision so there is an opportunity for the board to consider all of their feedback and confirm the final set of land users with that they will include in the regeneration plan within something that they 're formally decisions 29 parties including any changes or amendments the board wishes to make once we have received your feedback in the feedback of other section 29 parties the board will make a final consideration and then something they plan to administer can you confirm that even those unsolicited bids like there 's any others that may come and are listened to we 're considering in a ceasing for all of the feedback that we 've received absolutely thank you Yanni thank you I was just interested in the timing in the release of the central so the advice is that going to all of us on Friday or how are we receiving it and obviously it before we finalized a LTP which is now not possible so are you able to talk us through the process for us receiving and reacting to that advice what the current planners yeah thanks yummy so it 's the board 's intention to provide for you draft advice for discussion it 's advice to the council and the crown so it 's not an our intention at this stage to make that advice publicly available what we 'd like to do is share it with you and then later in June once your staff have had an opportunity to work through that advice and provide you with their own advice for us to meet with you probably in the third or fourth week of July and discuss the advice that we 've provided including the recommendations any sort of financial implications for us well there are a range of options for you to consider but the primary driver for us isn 't to suggest there to either party injects a large sum of additional funding there are a number of other levers in mechanisms that we believe are available maybe it 's a question of staff how we integrate that into the recent decisions we 've just made around you know central city parking right three baits DS these rebates so if I could suggest because the advice is it is being finalized at the moment there are a number of final matters that the board is considering before we submit it to you it is being provided to you for discussion so I 'd suggest that once you 've received it and then your staff have had a chance to have a look at it and provide you with advice that there is a discussion for us to have with the councillors in July yeah let 's let 's receive the advice first and then you know from there we can work out what the implications of it are and what further decisions that there are that might flow on from that yep thank you any further questions all right so we 've got a resolution in front of us to receive the report which I 'm happy to move to I have a seconder Erin all those indeed for the input this morning thank you okay so then moving on to item 15 development Christchurch limited the performance report and we 've got Rob Hall and Joe Liske welcome to the table this morning exactly as with the last item are there any comments or additional information that you wanted to provide alongside this report but just in addition to the report that we have tabled can confirm that resource consent for the Christchurch hot polls in New Brighton has been lodged playground upgrades will be happening in July which includes and Caleb Robinson the master carvers from Knight are who to fit the balance tune end of the walker which will be very exciting and also that we 're just continuing a piece of work with lands information new zealand to look at a vista gauging the potential use of compulsory acquisition powers that may need to be deployed in your browser thank you are there any questions on the DCL report all right so we 've got a recommendation in front of us to receive the report and obviously that noting provision as well I second all those in favor against that 's carried and then item 13 the corporate finance report which went through the finance and performance committee again there 's that exception around the interest rate repricing the the debt hedging there which is the same issue that we deal with each time this report comes up that will resolve as noted in the report but this went through finance and performance we don 't have staff at the table we 're there any questions anybody was wanting to raise on this report Dion okay thank you so I 'm happy again to move the resolution that 's in front of us Dion is happy to second all those in favor against that 's carried now moving to the regulatory performance committee item eight the alcohol ban in written wicket and race course on New Zealand cup day 2018 event day view and chaired this item at the committee do you want to make some introductory remarks simply roll over the stage later in the year we are looking at a review of the bylaws fixtures in so it 's an interim you and so you 're happy to move Jimmy will second were there any questions for staff we 've got Ruth here at the table if there are okay so this has been moved and seconded all those in favor against that 's carried thank you the social community of the social Community Development Housing Committee there are two items items 10 and 11 that we 'll deal with next we don 't have the chair all the Deputy Chair of that committee here with us this morning do we have a staff member for item 10 so in the absence of the chair being here did you want to just make some brief remarks on on this report and it 's really extending on the smoke-free policy that exits and 2015 so there 's been some consultation on this with the community so I think the report sort of highlights that there 's support from customers and residents there 's also been some consultation with business owners so this is a change to the policy clearly it 's not enforceable it 's voluntary so when we we have agreements 's an agreement which is signed we don 't have the ability or presumably coming from the committee the desire to insert a clause into those agreements requiring that this be the case requirement yep non-regulatory totally voluntary yep okay thank you so I 've got a number of questions signaled so Jamie Pauline Erin and Tim Jamie thank you noting that it 's voluntary in nature just in real terms could you let me know what the difference would be then for say a bar that had an outdoor area the chose to have that as a smoke-free section versus if this policy winter he 'd make smoke-free then it would be just not having ashtrays available so sort of promotional coffee culture for example of taking places that do it now how does that differ to the moment after this is potentially approved it remains voluntary afterwards yeah okay Pauline no some of them thought that they might lose some of their customers and they didn 't want to be seen as that 's why it 's all been voluntary those those that want to you know I to go down right and then they can say you know what the council has this policy Thank You Ellen yes so Mike just question is just around the unintended consequences of this policy and given that bars team to win some some people consume alcohol even one drink they like to smoke and it might be the only time they ever smoke um so there is that kind of knock-on effect people are smoking around these places but by having this policy in the removal of ashtrays people who smoke and just make their own n team to just they finish it there 's nowhere to put the cigarette back so they just threw out and so the unintended consequences of this policy is that there 's no ashtrays and so as a council we 're encouraging people to just drop the cigarette back either on footpath which makes it way into our waterways and so on and so forth do we have an answer today or are we looking at options around that or do we say please don 't smoke here but if you do here 's think that as but if you go to in the business location to spa detection the outside the hospital right down by the smokers rent or the non-smoking smoke around things like the it 's always about how people then do dispose of it with smoking so yeah a grateful the night that there 's non-smoking more kick then people stop smoking inside it was just literally like that and and I think all the non-smokers are really happy for that but the my Vasanth go outside and smoke beard I 've now done that but now we 're saying don 't smoke there and if you do we won 't give you any where to put your air stray so I 'm wondering if it is too far they 're just annoying straight there yeah I mean I think they had some success with the trial thank you Tim thank you this is technically that an extension of what we 're doing in that our sports fields and part someone mentioned before about you know our event organizers or whatever it required to when they sign a an event of it and I this is an unforced ball thing if we were either going to do this I would hate to do say Council to put on something on an event organizer or a bar or whatever that we unable to do ourselves so I think that really works well on our sports fields and our parks with regards to the question raised before about the cigarette butts we also hear that policy about and fines for littering could we put the signage reminding people of the responsibilities up around these areas going that would be an A+ and it 's not just cigarette butts are a whole lot of things that are dropped and just to remind people because without self responsibility for our environment in our city in our environment we 'll stop then then I think that we 've kind of missing the point with it you 've got a truck backup the emphasis on individuals I think would be quite good to be able to kind of pinpoint cover those people that are dropping cigarette butts as a small thing but it is an issue be really good to be able to ping a cup of people individual responsibility for our community it 's very seldom there someone even light up that is you know they 'd probably run off to the car park and hide but even the year they get pinged by the other parents alright so keeping with questions Dave and then Vicki Dave comments to both Aaron and made the unintended consequences and whilst I 'm very supportive of what 's being proposed here we do have their problem of cigarettes in them but one thing that allows me a little bit and some level of service that we 've probably got to go back and review is that we 've actually removed countless rubbish bins around the city so on the one hand if we are wanting to promote smoke-free areas around our restaurants and bars or particularly restaurants which are hugely in favor of if we are going to promote that I do support the notion that we perhaps need more signage around public spaces of their responses moving to a question my question is thank you can we it was probably more directed at the chief executive but I think in weekend we if we are promoting a better and healthier city in terms of their attitude to smoking in litter that we do I think we should consider that but you have absolutely opportunity to do that when we look at labels asinus thank you thank you and Vicki mines also an opportunistic question sorry so in i3 I have no problem with any of this resolution but I 'm just wondering if and three and I 'm not going to ask you to do it now I just want to know if it 's legally possible that we could actually request licensing staff to provide information about single-use straws and other rubbish at the same time is that would that be possible or becoming excellent thank you all right so do we have a move have we moved no nobody 's moved this already have they so do we have a mover for this resolution Tim will move Vicki we 'll second is there any debate Jamie action there 's an equal and opposite reaction and I am going to support four and five recommendations four and five is that it notes that the Cancer Society will provide sticky material for licensed premises wanting to become a smoke-free in five notes that Health Organization 's will work with those businesses that want to become smoke-free I think that 's ample in going back to with every action there 's an equal and opposite reaction we only need to think and this is something we do a lot of and council parking issues whenever you say you can 't do something here then the problem moves somewhere else and that 's fine so long is that it 's manageable so we have legislation saying you can 't smoke inside bits accepted so we asked people to go outside by then seriously urging them or essentially saying they can 't go outside I don 't know where you expect them to do go people that want to smoke are still going to smoke and if they can 't smoke in parks they can 't smoke inside and they 're enjoying their beer at the end of the week leaner on council property you expect them to stand in the middle of the Aven River or you know in the middle of the road so I think it 's you know a little bit draconian in slightly nineteen eighty-four ish if you 're telling people you know that what they can and can 't_''_2201.21 do they have every right to have a cigarette well they 're having a drink outside we want them to go outside make sure once they finish with this cigarette if they must mike would quite like them to put an ashtray but i think that if you tell them that they can 't smoke can you put in or you make will you create an environment where it 's completely unacceptable for them to go outside in smoke they are still going to smoke anyway so I think we need to be worried about what those what the implications of that are if you take something away you have to provide something else so I just don 't think it 's realistic I think the fact of the matter is one and ten people will be a heck of a lot more that will have the odd cigarette with a drink and the most likely time that they were the environment they will do that is that they go down to the pub at the end of the week they order a beer they can 't smoke inside so they 'll sit outside in an area and with his nest tray and have a cigarette with their drink and whether you agree with it or not there is the reality of life and the lifestyle for a number of people so just simply tell they can 't smoke inside the can 't smoke outside what the heck do you expect them to do I think it 's a nanny state gone mad and I won 't be supporting it I think there are far more important things the council should be doing other than telling people they can 't have a cigarette outside Pauline and I don 't believe in the nanny state however this is around food and I don 't think anyone likes cigarettes smoke being blown around food and I think support to people who want to engage us so commercial operators will I would say if they 're worried about losing custom and looking after their customers they might have a designated area outside it 's not around the eating area so that 's up to them to sort that out so because it 's voluntary and because it 's around food I 'll support this today society stick as a biodegradable because we 've enough cover with there yes cigarette butts that I 'm gonna support this you know being a Knick smoking myself I feel very privileged to be able to say I 've given up which is fantastic I really do that seeing the the change around sports fields etc and to carry this on I think is it 's just a natural progression because the fix the matter are smoking kills people we do not want to encourage it and have one and ten people still wrigley smoking affects nine people around them so I think we 've got to lead by this it 's not forcing people it 's encouraging people by voluntary we do so I will be supporting one to five Sara it 's an exaggeration to say that we 're telling people they can 't smoke outside it 's a complete nonsense all we 're saying is it 's in those outdoor dining areas on council and footpaths many businesses had their own outdoor areas that aren 't on council put pads and people will smoke a nose but if you have you know a group of moms and their kids and they 're being for a walk and that 's sitting down for coffee what you don 't want it 's a whole part of smokers and then it 's table puffing smoke over towards them you know it 's it 's quite easy for to someone to get up and you know walk five meters away or go and stand on the riverbank it 's Jamie I 'd like them to do or in the middle of the river so much and not blow smoke over people who are enjoying it quite coffee and I think it 's quite quite straightforward it 's voluntary businesses will choose to do it think you know public good in a public place is what we 're about Dave as very smoke I support the recommendations before us and I think I 'd just like to to note really that the intention really is and through them all is around restaurants and food there 's Pawlenty and I am all in favor of I think you know other speakers have noted that a number of institutions bars particularly do have their own smoking areas on the premises or in their own title of land so I don 't think it 's going to be a big issue but I am very keen on seeing a voluntary policy on smoking around food areas being implemented so yes I will support the resolution Aaron I probably would have let this one slip but I think it was Jamie that won me over and his explanation of what people do at five o 'clock on a Friday and I end to agree with them and we 'll vote the same way that he is against one two and three even though I hated my parents smoking never I 've been around a hospital for a while and seen the practices and play and I think asking people to go outside and smoke was was enough that had a huge impact on people that work in the industry and that was good enough smokers have been really good about it I 've gone out and stood in the cold now for ten years and good on them but it is a step too far and given that I think in Christchurch now there 's less than ten actual pub licenses left every other license is actually a food license when you go to drink and they can only be open because they 've attached themselves there 's a restaurant it 's how they get around it and there 's not many of the pubs if you can name them all I 'll give you a price it 'll be won 't be a paper secretes it 'll have to be a beer this time great yeah I mean I appreciate the comments that have been made around the table there 's there 's no harm in this and is purely voluntary people will choose whether they spoke or not businesses will choose whether they provide out for outdoor smoking areas or smoke-free areas or not all we 're doing here is the couple of noting provisions that everybody 's happy with four and five that 's a matter of fact and one two and three you know is is a policy change which keeps the the policy absolutely voluntary we 're encouraging rather than requiring and each individual business will decide how it wants to respond to this change in policy and each individual smoker as a customer of those businesses will decide how they choose to respond to that but promoting smoke-free outdoor spaces in my view is entirely commendable and it remains voluntary how businesses respond to that and I think that 's absolutely the right approach so it 's some certainly a soft handed rather than heavy-handed approach but in my view it 's a move in the right direction and it represents a further step in what really has been quite a strong relationship between the aspirations of the Cancer Society and the fresh I 'm sure the chair and deputy chair would have said this if they were here over a number of years but that 's always focused on the voluntary nature of smoke-free rather than the enforcement approach so I 'll be happy to support this today so we 've got a mover and a seconder so I 'll put the motion all those can you put one two and three yes I will so I 'll put one two and three first all those in favor all right against No so Jamie the only one against and Aaron as well yep and then I 'll put on four and five all those in favor against so those carried em 1 2 3 are carried with them those a couple of dissenters as well thank you so then moving to the second item from that committee the heritage item approval of extension time for central city landmark heritage grant for Maclean 's mansion 387 Manchester Street so I 'm Brendan and Carolyn welcome to the table do you want to provide just some brief background comments of this report before we existing and the the building you probably all aware of the trust that 's purchasing the building from the current owners has gone through some change of trustees and they 've they 've basically moved to a point now where they can actually proceed with the project there were there was some storm with the trust and in terms of the negotiations with the owners for the price and that 's been resolved and the ready to go trevor lord is also a trustee so we 've got very one-off chants are supposed to really proceed and do something with this great building and we have a an organization that 's got it will be a phased project so it has to be has to be phased and hopefully will be sufficient to generate rolling interesting it 's a huge project it 's a fantastic building so i say was we were seeking an extension to an existing grant this is eighteen months to give them sufficient time to actually works so two questions arising from theirs the first of which just relates to the last line in the recommendation 8th of December 2019 you 've obviously got a reasonable degree of confidence that that will be achieved and the the committee obviously had a degree of confidence that would be achieved in as much as they 're making this recommendation to Council securing finding so if we didn 't approve this recommendation today obviously the extension wouldn 't occur the opportunity for the building would be lost for this particular building would be lost and the funds would return back to the landmark Heritage Grant pool for reallocation is that correct this is this is this is the one-off chance the trust has we just have to check that we would just have to have to confirm would be the case okay it may not turn out to be the answer to the question may not turn out to be relevant anyway yeah all right thank you so I 've got Dion and Mike Dion yeah I just wanted to tease out a little bit more about the completion date so are you quite certain that by the 8th of December when the resolution would expire again well be yes yep because they 're ready to go so as reasonably confident as you can be because my concern is that obviously there will be a new counsel at that stage and I just don 't want it to end up rolling into a new council to make that decision because then all of a sudden there 's some uncertainty for that for the you know the trust that 's doing this work unless confident as a can be that the trust is has got the experience on it now these are people who are used to dealing with these kind of problems three or four members of the Civic trust there 's an architect on the on the trust board now they 've got good a chance to do this as anybody could subsequently confident a sub singer subsequent question really is as would it be would it be wise or would it be wise or should it be done to be make it 12 months so that we can if it 's not you know there might be a bit more certainty around where they 're at so again and current circumstances or do you there 's no benefit to them getting a reduction in time we haven 't done that with anybody else they realistically they will need 18 months this is this is a big project I really prefer to give them the certainty that they 've got a recognised and established length of time to do these kind of works we 've we 've had this 18 month period of time since the grant began it 's the kind of timeframes that you really do need into to make sure that any any unforeseen circumstances and they usually are some with a heritage I don 't you know I 'm not worried about the 18 months what I 'm worried about is that it comes to the 18 months there 's a new council that might have a new direction or something like there and then it gets to that they 're almost done and then all of a sudden that you need to get that extinction point and they go no you can 't do it yeah we 'll be in touch with them the work start we 'll be in touch with them on a regular basis usually every trying to think strategically and because I want to make sure that this actually thank you Mike they in the last day today they can only do it with some they 've they 're waiting for so the question I guess around the financial impacts this near two million dollar grab when was the financial December 2016 okay so that went off our books and we don 't thank you just following on from Dion 's question if there was a concern about certainty and the length of time presumably that would lead to a consideration of whether we would make the period of extension longer rather than shorter so if we were to say 24 months rather than 18 months would that address the issue that Dion has raised you know if there was some doubt that 18 months would be long enough presumably you would go to a longer period before a further decision was required rather than a shorter one established time frame if if they are for whatever reason going time they advise it could be yep not better to do that by further decision at that time but you would bring that back to us to try to October 2019 so it would be this elected council that made that decision rather than a future Council I think it might be good to pick up the [Music] matter of course you would come back to Council for a decision six months out from the 8th of December 19 which is before October 19 anyway initially the process and the project is proceeding in accordance with the committed so if we get to a point and we always write to successful applicants to remind them after a period of time they really should have started to claim in the ground because the grant should have been fully claimed by the 18 months so if we if we 're getting no response from them then then obviously something 's not right so we will write to them but I don 't think we 'll get to that situation we will find out pretty early on whether or not proceeding and then and large project I think from that we can be comfortable that issue that 's been raised with it is in hand it will be addressed if it needs to be addressed and clearly the important part today is to provide them certainty so that they can settle on the purchase as well note that those reports should yeah it sounds as though all checks and balances are in place Deon did you have something further no all right so can I then have a move for this report so Aaron seconded dion any debate all those in favor Oh Mike when this first came to council I did oppose it so I will oppose it again I just struggle with the quantum of these grants you know it 's nearly 2 million dollars and and we know that represents half of of right so we 've we 've just gone for a long term play and we we 've seen rate increases of over 5% in people out there a struggling I can 't say yes to this when we have so many people they 're actually out there we see the priority line thank you I 'd make the point that these funds are already on budget and have been on budget for some time I 've already been allocated to this project and if we weren 't to approve this today there 's some question about whether the funds would come back to the Landmark heritage grant fund although from previous examples my understanding is that it would that would then mean that these funds would be allocated to other similar projects rather than been used to alleviate any other Council funding pressure or all creator a rates reduction even that we 've just approved the long term plan but certainly appreciate the sentiment I will now put the motion all those in favor against that 's carried thank you thanks very much yeah Mike did you want your vote recorded against Mike did you want your vote recorded against yeah sure okay we 'll do that so now moving to item 17 the audit and risk management committing [Music] okay so this has obviously already been through the audit and risk management committee there are a are there any questions for staff on this all right so I 'm happy to move the recommendation do I have a seconder Ref all those in favor against that 's carried then moving to item 18 the audit New Zealand report to Council on the audit of the consultation document for the 2018 28 long-term plan and what we got was a issue of an unmodified opinion which is noted in this outcome so I 'm happy to move that do I have a seconder Pauline all those in favor against that 's carried and then the audit New Zealand interim management report item 19 and again a number of noting provisions in Part C and receiving the report in part ii '_''_3672.46 so again I 'm happy to move that Dave East is happy to second all those in favor against that 's carried thank you now moving on to the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee item 22 construction site hoardings Pauline did you want to make some introductory remarks on this one please council and providing that they kind of pretty it up and make it look been well used so you are happy to move this Mike savages second luring questions on this one consideration given to outside of the Central City we talked about there there 's been no no applications from outside the Central City to date and it is considered on a case-by-case basis so are we charging anyone outside of the central city yeah the questions really are around the the thinking of reducing the areas available to fee waiver to focus on the central city Pauline 's given an answer to that question and has also indicated that she would be happy to remove that change but the question that we 've got now is whether there have been any applications and whether we 're charging anybody outside of the central city but the thinking of reducing the areas available for the fee waiver just to focus on the central setting is cause there hasn 't_''_3835.769 been up taking the suburban areas is that correct of course that doesn 't mean that there won 't be future opportunities in suburban areas particularly bearing in mind that some areas you know construction in the in the near future sorry if you could just repeat that again the comment about building to the boundary that would be the case in some suburban areas as well I mean there 's a requirement in Littleton for example to build right up to the paper and boundary I mean I just can 't see the Hartmann if there is a case I would tend to agree with that Pauline would you be happy to move the resolution with that recommended change removed from from our staff perspective and the three to to pay into the fee waiver so well this series being available for we would make an estimate of how much funding it 's it 's in terms of Council budget the whole budget it 's not significant but it still needs to be accounted and what is the update on the budget been in the past have we fully expended this budget or not in the past so it 's likely that there 's capacity there Mike are you happy for that um change okay so Pauline you already moved this so let 's the original resolution so we 'll need to deal with this is an amendment then in that case which Yanni you 're having to moved you want to give us some wording or just remove the so the amendment would be that we don 't make the change to reduce the area 's available to fee waiver to focus on the central city I 'm happy to second that so let 's just get the wording up well we 'll put the amendment and vote on it so yeah I just we had this big debate about four hundred thousand dollars lost revenue for a one-hour free kappa sort of situation then we 've got four hundred thousand dollars all right thank you so let 's deal with the amendment first so Yanni you 're moving on seconding yeah you know I think anything we can do to enhance the presentation of our city is really important and there 's been a huge focus in the central city and I 'm not criticizing that but you know we 've got derelict sites in our suburbs that are seeing they 're hasn 't been any update yet of those suburban sites like I would have thought that means that it 's cost neutral to leave it in and it may be that it 's not used but if there was a case for it then I 'd rather the ability for it to be able to be applied rather than have an exception because you know just having footpaths blocked off in the suburbs with ghastly construction hoarder I think is really you know why should that be okay in the suburbs but not in the central city so I think the amendments harmless its rights neutral and it just provides the ability for if there 's a need for it to be able to be done on KanCare we concur with the comments that have been made and I don 't see why we would make a change to to remove this opportunity from the suburban areas just because it hasn 't taken up in been taken up in the past we know that there are a number of suburban areas that haven 't redeveloped as quickly as we might space when that 's necessary when we know that in some of those suburban areas development economics is marginal at best why we will be putting an additional burden onto those I don 't really understand and at the same time the comments that yani is made regarding you know the appearance of our suburban areas particularly during construction projects surely the considerations around appearance of suburban areas in that situation would be exactly the same as they would in the Central City I would suggest the only reason we haven 't had up taking the suburban areas is that the development hasn 't happened as quickly as we might have expected there may be a future application for this we shouldn 't rule it out it may or may not be taken up but some yeah the amenity of our suburban areas is just as important as the amenity in the Central City jomi very briefly yep no worries with the amendment makes sense to apply it to the suburban scenes as well the only thing I 'll add to this is in my apologies for sounding like a 's really important as a council that if you take with one hand you need to give with the other so we are indeed charging those responsible I would suggest lien owners that have derelict sites them in Croke terms in the public realm but for those that are getting on with the job investing in the city in trying the abyss to make sure that the rebuild is positive and that the construction hoardings are attractive and compliant with with our regulatory framework then I think they should be rewarded as well so there 's absolutely no sense and punishing those good people that are doing exactly what we want them to do so very happy to support thank you further debate on the amendment okay sir I agree with everything that 's been said I don 't know visit to the update will be all right so I 'll put the amendments all those in favor say aye against so the amendments carried so nothing else on the substantive motion with the amendment incorporated deal I agree with what Jamie said I think this is you know tidying of having some incentives here to to make the developments tidy as it right but I do question how that 's actually working in reality sometimes there 's some of these sites you know they 've got creative audience but around them are still very dirty very filthy our central city is in a very tidy place and actually we need to start thinking about everything else that 's going on in the central city and what we actually can do to actually tidy it up because it is a real big construction area if you sort of look around it 's not just that it 's not just the hoarding sites actually these these areas that are working on public roads and they 're driving our trucks out going on the road and the mud sort of following them I don 't think we 're enforcing enough around actually creating a tidy environment for our central city and I really want us from this to actually start thinking to that because we are losing a lot of revenue on giving these and symptoms and maybe we should be thinking lost and actually doing other things that might be able able to tidy up the central city Thank You support this you 'll support it great I 'm like I just want to check in with you are you still happy to be the secondary of this motion with the amendments included yep that 's great thank you all right so I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye against that 's carried thank you very much so now I will resolve to exclude of the public and we 've got a number of people in this resolution for the various different papers that we 're going to be considering so I 'm happy to move this resolution as it stands do I have a seconder and so Vicki okay yep what do you want put separately 48 that 's it okay

    "text": "so then moving to the second item from that committee the heritage item approval of extension time for central city landmark heritage grant for McLean 's mansion 387 Manchester Street so I 'm Brendan and Carolyn welcome to the table do you want to provide just some brief background comments of this report before we consider it request for an extension of time to an existing and the the building you probably all aware of the trust that 's purchasing the building from the current owners has gone through some change of trustees and they 've they 've basically moved to a point now where they can actually proceed with the project there were there was some storm with the trust and in terms of the negotiations with the owners for the price and that 's been resolved and the is all ready to go trevor lord is also a trustee so we 've got very one-off chants are supposed to really proceed and do something with this great building and we have a an organization it will be a phased project so it has to be has to be interest in the building and generate income for it 's a huge project it 's a fantastic building so I say was we were seeking an extension to an existing grant this isn 't to further a team to give them sufficient time to actually works so two questions are rising from there the first of which just relates to the last line in the recommendation the new completion date for the project would be the 8th of December 2019 you 've obviously got a reasonable degree of confidence that that will be achieved and the the committee obviously had a degree of confidence that would be achieved in as much as they 're making this recommendation to Council securing finding so if we didn 't approve this recommendation today obviously the extension wouldn 't occur the opportunity for the building would be lost for this particular building would be lost and the funds would return back to the landmark Heritage Grant pool for reallocation is that correct this is this is this is the one-off chance the trust has we just have to check the financial year that we case okay it may not turn out to be the answer to the question may not turn out to be relevant anyway all right thank you so I 've got Dion and Mike Dion just wanted a little bit more about the completion date so are you quite certain that by the 8th of December when the resolution would expire again that they will be in a position where they can draw down well be granted the money are you pretty confident or seriously confident yes yep because they 're ready to go so as a reasonably confident as you can be because my concern is that obviously there will be a new counsel at that stage and I just don 't want it to end up rolling into a new counsel to make that decision because then all of a sudden there 's some uncertainty for that for the you know the trust that 's doing this work I 'm as confident as a can be that the trustee is has got the experience on it now these are people who are used to dealing with these kind of 's an architect on the on the trust board now they 've got good a chance to do this as anybody could subsequently confident a sub singer a subsequent question really is as would it be would it be wise or would it be wise or should it be done to be make it twelve months so that we can if it 's not you know there might be a bit more certainty around where they 're at so that you can actually make a decision to extend it again current circumstances or do you there 's no benefit to them getting a reduction in time we haven 't done that with anybody else they realistically they will need 18 months this is this is a big project I really prefer to give them the certainty that they 've got recognized an established length of time to do these kind of works we 've we 've had this 18 month period of time since the grants began it 's the kind of timeframes that you really do need to make sure that any any unforeseen circumstances and they usually are not worried about the 18 months what I 'm worried about is that it comes to the 18 months is a new council that might have a new direction or something like that and then it gets to that they 're almost done and then all of a sudden like you need to get that extinction point and they go no you can 't do it yeah we 'll be in touch with them obviously once once assuming the ground has approved in the work start we 'll be in touch with them on a regular basis usually every they 're trying to think strategically and because I want to make sure that this actually thank you Mike in the last day today they 've waiting for so the question I guess around the financial this near 2 million dollar grab when was the financial 850 seemed the 2016 okay so they don 't win off our books and we don 't have to thank you just following on from Dion 's question if there was a concern about certainty and the length of time presumably that would lead to extension longer rather than shorter so if we were to say 24 months rather than 18 months would that address the issue that Dion has raised you know if there was some doubt that 18 months would be long enough presumably you would go to a longer period before a further decision was required rather than a shorter well established time frame if if they are for whatever reason going to exceed that that may just be for for whatever time they they advise it could be yep not better to do that by further decision at that time but you would bring that back to us to try a to October 2019 so it will be this elected council that made that decision rather than a future Council I think it might be good to pick up though as a matter of course you would come back to Council for a decision six months out from the 8th of December 19 which is before October 19 anyway the process and the project is proceeding in accordance with the anticipated so if we get to a point we always write they really should have started to claim in the ground because the grant should have been fully claimed by the 18 months so if we if we 're getting no response from them then then obviously something 's not right so we will write to them situation we will find out pretty early on whether or not the works of preceding and then usually what happens is because it 's such a large grant and large project we will agree to keep the thing I think from that we can be comfortable that the issue that 's been raised with it is in hand it will be addressed if it needs to be addressed and clearly the important part today is to provide them certainty so that they can settle on the purchase thing as well note those reports should reference yeah it sounds as though all checks and balances are in place Dionne did you have something further no all right so can I then have a move for this report so Aaron seconded dion any debate all those in favor Oh Mike when this first came to council I just struggle with the quantum of these grants you know it 's nearly two million dollars and and we know that represents half a percent of of rates and we 've we 've just gone for a long team play and we we 've seen rate increases of over five percent in people out there a struggling I can 't say yes to this when we have so many people they 're actually out there struggling they 're on fixed incomes and this is where we see the priority line thank you I 'd make the point that these funds are already on budget and have been on budget for some time I 've already been allocated to this project and if we weren 't to approve this today there 's some question about whether the funds would come back to the Landmark Heritage grant fund although from previous examples my understanding is that it would that would then mean that these funds would be allocated to other similar projects rather than been used to alleviate any other Council funding pressure or all creator a rates reduction given that the sentiment I will now put the motion all those in favor

    "text": "the social and community at the social Community Development Housing Committee there are two items items 10 and 11 that we will deal with next we don 't have the chair or the Deputy Chair of that committee here with us this morning do we have a staff member for item 10 so in the absence of the chair being here did you want to just make some brief remarks on this report and it 's really extending on the smoke-free policy that we 've adopted in exits in 2015 so there 's been some consultation on this with the community so I think the report sort of highlights that there 's support from customers and residents there 's also been some consultation with business owners that 's less clear but there are there is support also business owners with this approach and because it is voluntary so the report is to agree to it so this is a change to the policy clearly it 's not enforceable it 's voluntary so when we we have agreements presumably when we license a footpath for commercial use there 's an agreement presumably coming from the committee the desire to insert a clause into those agreements requiring that this be the case non regulatory totally voluntary okay thank you so I 've got a number of questions signal so Jamie Pauline Erin and Tim Jamie thank you noting that it 's voluntary in nature just in real terms could you let me know what the difference would be then for say a bar that had an outdoor area that chose to have that as a smoke-free section versus if this policy went ahead to make smoke free then it would be just not having ashtrays available so sort of promotion as coffee culture for example of taking places that do it now how does that differ to in the moment after this is potentially approved a similar approach yeah so it 's just it remains voluntary afterwards yeah okay Pauline some of them thought that they might lose some of their customers and they didn 't want to be seen as being the one who 's making those those that want to you know just providing support for them if they choose know what the council has this policy Thank You Aaron yes so my question is just around the unintended consequences of this policy and given that bars team to win some some people consume alcohol even one drink they like to smoke and it might be the only time they ever smoke um so there is that kind of knock-on effect people are smoking around these places but by having this policy in the removal of ashtrays people who smoke and just make their own in team to just they finish it there 's nowhere to put the cigarette back so they just throw it and so the unintended consequences of this policy is that there 's no ashtrays and so as a council we 're encouraging people to just drop the cigarette back either on footpath which makes it way into our waterways and so on and so forth do we have an answer today or are we looking at options around there although we say please don 't smoke here but if you do here 's a nice train to put your cigarette butts because they belong here kind of a self policing policy I think that as you go in the location to spot text me outside the hospital is rent or the non-smoking around things like the bus shelters it 's always about how people didn 't do dispose of it with smoking so yeah a grateful the night that there 's non-smoking more kick then people stop smoking inside it was just literally like that and and I think all the non-smokers are really happy for that but the EM with us and go outside and smoke their they 've now done that but now we 're saying don 't smoke there and if you do we won 't give you any where to put your ashtray so I 'm wondering if it is too far they 're just a no interests right there yeah I mean they could that there are different options around this I think they had some success with the trial so they did a trial last year last year just sort of in these instance sort of arise with all of those places in actually you know adopted it so you this is technically that an extension of what we 're doing in that our sports fields in part someone mentioned before about you know our I think organizers or whatever it required to when they sign a an event agreement to use a space that this would be part of it or not this is an unforced ball thing if we were either going to do this I would hate to do say Council to put on something on an event organizer or a bar or whatever that we were unable to do ourselves so I think that really works well on our sports fields and part with regards to the question raised before about the cigarette butts we also hear the policy about and fines for littering could we put the signage reminding people of the responsibilities up around these areas the only it would be positive and it 's not just cigarette that 's there are a whole lot of things that are dropped and just to remind people because without self responsibility for our environment in our city and our environment we 'll stop then then with this you 've got attract their emphasis on individuals yeah I think it would be quite good to be able to kind of pinpoint cover those people that are dropping cigarette that 's just a small thing but it is an issue when you put the more together into our waterways etc we 're really good to be able to ping a cup of people when Justin reminded it issue this that 's individual and self responsibility through our community and I think you 're actually seeing that kind of regulation sort of sitting expectations you know like it 's very seldom there someone would even light up that OHS you know they 'd probably run off to the cap hack and hide but even the year they get pinged by the other parents alright so keeping with questions Dave and then Vikki Dave on the comments to both Erin and Tim have made really on unintended consequences but one thing that service that we 've probably got to go back and review is that we 've actually removed countless rubbish bins around the city so on the one restaurants and bars particularly restaurants which are hugely in favor of if we are going to promote that I do support the notion that we perhaps need more signage around public spaces avere response is moving to a question my question is can we in association with so I think we need to start to review the level of service for this around the city a question it was probably more directed at the chief executive I think in weekend we if we are promoting a better and healthier city in terms of attitude to smoking and that we do think we should consider that but you have absolutely opportunity to do that when we look at labels to see this thank you thank you and Vicki mines also an opportunistic question sorry so in I three I have no problem with any of this resolution but I 'm just wondering if and three and I 'm not going to ask you to do it now I just want to know if it 's legally possible that we could actually request licensing staff to provide information about single-use straws and be possible or excellent thank you all right so do we have a move have we moved no nobody 's moved this already have they so do we have a mover for this resolution Tim will move Vicki will second is there any debate Jamie actually there 's an equal and opposite reaction and I 'm not going to support one two and three I am going to support four and five recommendations four and five is that it notes that the Cancer Society will provide sticking material for licensed premises wanting to become a smoke-free in five notes that the Health Organization 's will work with those businesses that want to become smoke-free I think that simple I 'm going back to with every action there 's an equal and opposite reaction we only need to think this is something we do a lot of and council parking issues whenever you say you can 't do something here then the problem moves somewhere else and it 's fine so long is that it 's manageable so we have legislation saying you can 't smoke inside bits so we asked essentially saying they can 't go outside I don 't know where you expect them to do go people that want to smoke are still going to smoke and if they can 't smoke in parks they can 't smoke inside and they 're enjoying their beer at the end of the week sitting outside of the council Leena those sorry sitting on Lina on council property you need to speak them to stand in the middle of the Aven River or you know in the middle of the road so I think it 's you know a little bit draconian and slightly nineteen eighty-four ish if you 're telling people you know that what they can and can 't_''_857.18 do they have every right to have a cigarette well they 're having a drink outside we want them to go outside and actually once they finish with this cigarette if they must might would quite like them to put an ashtray but I think that if you tell them that they can 't smoke and you put in or you make will you create an environment where it 's are still going to smoke anyway so I think we need to be worried about what those what the implications of that are if you take something away you have to provide something else so I just don 't think it 's realistic I think the fact of the matter is one in ten people regularly smoke one in 10 New Zealanders do and there will be a heck of a lot more that will have the odd cigarette with a drink and the most likely time that they were the environment they 'll do that there 's that they go down to the pub at the end of the week they order a beer they can 't smoke inside so they 'll sit outside in an area and with his nest tray and have a cigarette with a drink and whether you agree with it or not that is the reality of life in the lifestyle for a number of people so just simply tell they can 't smoke inside the can 't smoke outside what the heck do you expect them to do I think it 's a it I think there are far more important things that council should be doing other than telling people they can 't have a cigarette outside Pauline and I don 't believe in the nanny state however this is around food and I don 't think anyone likes cigarettes smoke being blown around food and I think because it 's a voluntary nature and we offering support to people who want to engage us so commercial operators will I would say if they 're worried about losing custom and looking after their customers they might have a designated area outside that 's not around the eating area so that 's up to them to sort that out so because it 's voluntary and because it 's around food I 'll support this today society stick as a biodegradable because we 've enough trouble with the cigarette butts that I 'm going to support this you know being an X motion myself I feel very privileged to be able to say I 've given up which is fantastic I really do that seeing the change around sports fields etc and to carry progression because the fix the mirror are smoking kills people we do not want to encourage it and have one and ten people still wrigley smoking affixed nine people around them so I think we 've got to leave by this it 's not forcing people it 's encouraging people by voluntary we do that in our sports fields and it works extremely well so I will be supporting one two five Sarah just joining the favors here it 's an exaggeration to say that we 're telling people they can 't smoke outside it 's a complete nonsense all we 're saying is it 's in those outdoor dining areas on council and footpaths many businesses had their own outdoor areas that aren 't on council put parts and people will smoke and those but if you have you know a group of moms and their kids and they 've been for a walk and they 're sitting down for coffee what you don 't want is a whole pile of smokers and get the next table puffing smoke over towards them you know it 's it 's quite five metres away or go and stand on the riverbank is Jamie I 'd like them to do or in the middle of the river so much and not blow smoke over people who are enjoying a quiet coffee and I think it 's quite quite straightforward it 's voluntary businesses will choose to do it or they will they will choose not to and I think you know public good in a public place is what we 're about Dave it 's very smoke I support the recommendations before us and I think I just like to to note really that the intention really is and through them all is around restaurants and food there 's Pauline too and I am all in favor of [Music] other speakers have noted that a number of institutions bars particularly do have their own smoking areas on the premises or in their own title of land so I don 't think it 's going to be a big issue but I am very keen on seeing a voluntary policy on smoking around food areas being implemented so yes I will support the but I think it was Jamie that won me over and his explanation of what people do at five o 'clock on a Friday and I 18 to agree with them and we 'll vote the same way that he is against one two and three even though I hated my parents smoking never smoked myself so I 'm not a reformed smoker but I 've been around a hospital for a while and seen the practices and play and I think asking people to go outside and smoke was was enough that had a huge impact on people that work in the industry and that was good enough smokers have been really good about it I 've gone out and stood in the cold now for 10 years and good on them but it is a step too far and given that I think in Christchurch now there 's less than 10 actual pub licenses left every other license is actually a food license where you go to drink and they can only open because they 'll attach themselves is a restaurant is how they get around it and name them all I 'll give you a price it 'll be won 't be a paper cigarettes it 'll have to be a beer this time grace yeah I mean I appreciate the comments that have been made around the table there 's there 's no harm in this and there may well be some good in this in my view this is purely voluntary people will choose whether they spoke or not businesses will choose whether they provide outdoor smoking areas or smoke-free areas or not all we 're doing here is the couple of noting provisions that everybody 's happy with four and five that 's a matter of fact and one two and three one you know is a policy change which keeps the the policy absolutely voluntary we 're encouraging rather than requiring and each individual business will decide how it wants to respond to this change in policy and each individual smoker as a customer of those businesses will decide how they choose to respond to that but promoting smoke-free outdoor spaces in my view is entirely commendable and it remains voluntary how businesses right approach so it 's some certainly a soft handed rather than heavy-handed approach but in my view it 's a move in the right direction and it represents a further step in what really has been quite a strong relationship between the aspirations of the Cancer Society and the fresh air project with Council and with the the committee and I 'm sure the chair and Deputy Chair would have said this if they were here over a number of years but that 's always focused on the voluntary nature of smoke-free rather than the enforcement approach so I 'd be happy to support this today so we 've got a mover and a seconder so I 'll put the motion all those can you put one two and three yes I will so I 'll put one two and three first all those in favor all right against no so Jamie the only one against and Aaron as well yep and then I 'll put on four and five all those in favor against so those carried em 1 2 3 are carried with them those a couple of dissenters as well thank you _"

gone through the finance and performance committee are there any remarks that you wanted to make about this report as we move into the discussion today in a report so as most of you will be aware we launched the redzone futures exhibition on the 26th of May it has been open for almost five weeks and it closes this week on Saturday it 's an opportunity for people to give us feedback on the refine shortlist that the board decided in April to date we 've had over 7,000 people who have come to the central exhibition and provide us with feedback generally overwhelming support for the proposal induces in particular the green spine and the users included within the green point we 've also had a traveling exhibition which has gone to shopping malls council libraries and service centers in sports fields and up until this week and in addition we 've held a number well represented in public engagement once the engagement closes this week on Saturday will then be assessing all of the feedback that we have received and we received lots in different forms and we 'll be presenting that to the board for them to make a decision on the final set of land-uses before the planners seems to 1629 parties including the council for you to provide formal feedback and comment in terms of moving to phase 2 of developing a regeneration strategy for South Shore and South New Brighton as the following a recent presentation that councillors received from the how team and region christchurch and council staff we are now moving to phase two which includes establishing in physical presence within South Shore and South you Brighton to provide an opportunity for people to drop in to have conversations to access information ahead of implementing the engagement plan that was developed by the housing and that 'll be starting within the next couple of weeks recently we published the vision for Cathedral Square it 's had a lot of response really interesting responses from different parts of the council staff to develop delivery strategy to look at what can be delivered in we finally we are finalizing the advice to provide to council by the end of June I 'm conscious that today is the Thursday before the end of June so we 're going to provide this to you by the end of the week which evaluates progress in the central city and provides advice for the council and for the crown to consider in terms of increasing momentum within the central city the board was very pleased to receive from the council a draft proposal for the use of powers under Section 71 of the greater christchurch regeneration act to enable the development of our sports facility in your test regenerate christchurch provided us views on that and looks forward to receiving it from the council once it 's been closed views have been considered by the council I understand in September so that 's a brief overview of highlights I guess you would say since the report was tabled happy to take questions thank you are there any questions for Ivan Aaron and then Yanni proposal in that group and then of course I 've done their proposal so the question would be is there any consideration given that feedback to that proposal and that group going forward sure that 's what we are doing at the moment is seeking feedback on the refine shortlist that has been published the intention is to consider all of the feedback and then the board will make a subsequent decision so there is an opportunity for the board to consider all of their feedback and confirm the final set of land users with that they were included in the regeneration plan within something that they 're formally decision 29 parties including any changes or amendments the board wishes to make once we have received your feedback in the feedback of other section 29 parties the board will make a final consideration and then something that the plan to administer can you confirm that even those unsolicited bids like there 's than any others that may come and are listened to we 're considering an assessing all of the feedback that we 've received absolutely thank you Yani thank release of the central so the advice is that going to all of us on Friday or how are we receiving it and obviously I think previously I was kind of keen to get it before we finalized to LTP which is now not possible so are you able to talk us through the process for us receiving and reacting to that advice what the current planners yeah thanks yummy so it 's the board 's intention to provide for you draft advice for discussion it 's advice to the council and the crown so it 's not in our intention at this stage to make that advice publicly available what we 'd like to do is share it with you and then later in June once your staff have had an opportunity to work through that advice and provide you with their own advice for us to meet with you probably in the third or fourth week of July and discuss the advice that we 've provided including the recommendations any sort of financial implications for us well there are a range of options for you to consider but to either party in Jake 's large summer of additional funding there are a number of other levers in mechanisms that we believe are available to the the council to consider I mean maybe it 's a question of staff how we integrate that into the recent decisions we 've just made around you know central city parking right three baits DC 's three beds so if I could suggest because the advice is it is being finalized at the moment there are a number of final matters that the board is considering before we submit it to you it is being provided to you for discussion so I 'd suggest that once you 've received it and then your staff have had a chance to have a look at it and provide you with advice that there is a discussion for us to have with the councillors in July yep let 's let 's receive their advice first and then you know from there we can work out what the implications of it are and what further decisions there are that might flow on for me yep thank you resolution in front of us to receive the report which I 'm happy to move to I have a seconder Erin

going to we 're going to use a standing order which is alteration by resolution at same meeting so because the meeting was adjourned we are still in the same meeting and so if you look up on the screen you 'll see that we 're replacing bring forward the funding for section 2 of the heath quirk heath could expressway by one year from 2020 for 25 and 25 26 to 23 24 and 25 26 so it was just the second year been missed off the bring forward and so it was just an error and the Southwest leisure center in library 20 1920 it 's the same thing 20 20 21 needs to be and of course we 've made the point on more than one occasion that if things gets resolved more quickly than that it can be it can be brought forward again and so that brings that forward on to the financial year that begins 1 July sorry yep sorry and and then and then we 're amending address the impacts of decisions on our climate change commitments which is just taking the we irrelevant phrase out which was actually a phrase from a previous part of the resolution that got lifted by accident so I 'll I 'll move those alterations driver seconder Andrew I 'll put that all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you what 's sufficient majority to carry the day so thank you very much for that so now we move on to adopting the infrastructure strategy and we have with we 've got a latest version of it this is the final final version and thanks to another set of eagle-eyes down the back there which has highlighted the fact that we can somebody point out the page points 96 that 's 96 so 96 will now read the second paragraph on environment will read crash which has chosen to be a leader in climate change in the mayor has signed the Global Covenant of Mears so thank you for highlighting that was written as an aspiration of something I was going to do but I 've actually done it already so it 's tidied that up so that 's the infrastructure strategy and can I just thank staff for the incredible amount of work that they did rewriting us and the time that they did and then getting it to the office of the Auditor General and well with the office of the Audit Office and and having it returned in time for today I really appreciate the effort that went into it sorry Phil thanks Leanne I just wondered the reason for under the key changes for their coastal pathway which have increased a twenty four million increased by 18 million in the previous version I 'm pretty sure it was thirteen million so just wonder what the reason for the increases it seems there 's 's 18 but what we don 't understand is where the two million has come from and she 's checking with those who are closer to it to find out sorry I 'm not I 'm not sure does that make any difference to the content of the yeah okay so so do we do we just want isn 't it something that you can adjust with the overall resolution of an adjustment because it 's been highlighted here okay yeah okay so if people were satisfied but that it can be adjusted if there 's an error and their staff for revising it 's not going to fit the financial strategy it won 't because it 's so far out in the plane and I think the purpose of putting it there was to ensure that it was available if there was the funding made available through the GTA yeah Jonnie question of clarification I know if additional money and to look at our infrastructure for example just take roading does on page 29 at the infrastructure does that now respond the additional funding that we 've put in you look at the four graphs that show you know in 2029 the roads getting worse just paged 29 of the accessibility as you know through the submissions and through our deliberations with additional funding and to deal with some of our infrastructure in response to the requests that people had made and I just wanted to check in terms of the infrastructure strategy that we 're now approving whether the graphs on page 29 now reflect that additional spend or whether they still need to be revised based on that additional spin being approved I 'm sorry I 'm just a little confused I thought what we 're done is try to put enough money and so that a road condition didn 't get worse so it wasn 't we 're getting more done just to clarify that graph for 2029 before we made the changes to the LTP in terms extra money for infrastructure what was the red box I mean it 's something that we 're going to have to continually come back to we know there and in once we 've gone through the levels of post LTP environment this is something that we really want to focus on and once we know what the government funding arrangements are going to be that 's going to give us so much more you know like I mean I think every council has been in this position of not knowing what 's coming and having to sign off the LTP before we 've got the GPS signed off from before we 've got the fire rates you know so we 've just got a little bit we 'll have a look well we 'll have some more flexibility and we 'll be able to reefing some of the sheep pasture shoes the see-cret aside good ways I think okay well I 'm I 'm happy to move the adoption of the infrastructure strategy second up by Sarah any discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you and now we now I will move that we receive the audit report adopt the long-term plan which includes all of the information and underlying documents the mayor 's to carlene 's one so yeah because Colleen 's report or memorandum citzen as an attachment to to my attachment and so she 's either done who support the establishment of the bank 's financial EP okay and I 've already written a letter of support and in fact they Canterbury me as have written a letter of support for the bank 's potential Geopark as well so we 're certainly undertaking that work so but to have it highlighted it was called out during the submission process so I think that 's the appropriate place to put it all of the attachments including the audit report referred to in resolution 8 so I 'll move that seconded by Mike Davidson I 'll put that motion all those no no we 'll get to that I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried so then we I 'll move that we authorized the CFO to make amendments required to ensure that the published LTP aligns with Council 's resolutions and to make any other non material changes that may be I 'll pop that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and then I 'll move that we authorize the CFO cetera to borrow in accordance with the policy etc grants an exemption and respected counsel controlled organizations allocates funding from the capital endowment fund has cleared the attachment and do I have a seconder for that not up to the rate sheet Andrew I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried now then I 'll move the rates one but I 've had a number of people who want to vote have their vote recorded on the special heritage Cathedral targeted break so so if I could have a seconder for the resolution Andrew so at this stage I 've got councillors Johansson swags and Templeton was it we yeah and Davidson who was the case is there anyone else that wants to have their vote recorded against the special heritage Cathedral target of rage all right well I 'll put that one separately then all those in favor say aye those the whole resolution i just just keep going so the uniform know we 've done the rear say does the capital endowment fund we 've done there was that we just do the allocated funding from the cabin endowment fund alright it 's just that that was one that was flagged pretty like previously being some of us monitor votes recorded against the capital endowment fund it 's remember it 's outside of the policy and it 's going towards crusher Cinzia and there was a big discussion about some of us didn 't actually agree with that money being used to go to crush a Cinzia okay so sorry i missed that one and i 've been really careful to allow people to do that so could we just go back to item 13 and i 'll deal with that as a separate vote so is there anyone else that wants to have their vote recorded against the allocation of funding from the capital endowment fund or set out an attachment in sorry was it was it an attachment team it is it is is is there an easy the crusher chinzy because I assume it 's just the crash it chains need one for you to Yanni does it have a number attached to it as my question okay okay so counselors Johansson and Templeton recorded their vote against the allocation to Christchurch in seed from the capital endowment fund is it right yep good now so now but I 've got the balance of the rating one to put here by okay so I 'll put that resolution all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carriage did someone say no oh yeah it 's all of the raids yeah so you 're voting against any rates being applied at all against the rates [Music] right just seemed so short I said 24 all right good meeting can you just clarify the levels of service which it 's just it 's hard because we have different resolutions than what you 've got so the numbers don 't align but in terms of the levels of service is that sorry what are you referring to what part of the agenda are you referring to service have been adopted and under what resolution yeah yeah but I 've got we 've we 've got we 're undertaking a review of all of the levels of service now so once the LTP was concluded we 're moving into a review of the levels of service yes it 's recorded in my resolution that we 've already passed it we passed it last Friday that the council noting the recommendation of the mayor 's external advisory group request the chief executive to report back by 31 August 2018 with a plan for undertaking over a few of levels of service noting priority areas such as relating to safe and secure drinking water roads footpaths and active travel and citizens participation decision-making also noting that changes to levels of service that were made in the draft LTP and confirmed as part of the adoption of the LTP will also be part of that review we 've already passed that any recommendation that does that but just because I 'm reading a lot of attachment it 's okay that 's fine right okay so on that note thank you you _"

that 's carried so then we I 'll move that we authorized the CFO to make amendments required to ensure that the published LTP aligns with Council 's resolutions and to make any other non material changes that may be required have a seconder for that I 'm Andrew I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and then I 'll move that we authorize the CFO Citra to borrow in accordance with the allocates funding from the capital endowment fund there 's clear the attachment and do I have a seconder for that not up to the right sheet Andrew I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried now then I 'll move the rates one but I 've had a number of people who want to vote have their vote recorded on the special heritage Cathedral targeted break so so if I could have a seconder for the resolutions Andrew so at this stage I 've got councillors Johansson swigs and Templeton was it we yeah and Davidson who was the case is there anyone else that wants to have their vote recorded against the special heritage Cathedral targeted raise all right well I 'll put that one separately then all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and I 'll put whole resolution I just just keep going so the uniform you know we 've done the rest say does the capital endowment fund we 've done there when was that time we just stood allocated just that that was one that was flagged pretty like previously being some of us one of the votes recorded against the capital endowment fund it 's remember it 's outside of the policy and it 's going towards crusher Shunzhi and there was a big discussion about some of us didn 't actually agree with that money being used to go to crush a chinzy okay so sorry I missed that one and I 've been really careful to allow people to do that so could we just go back to item 13 and I 'll deal with that as a separate vote so is there anyone else that wants to have their vote recorded against the allocation of funding from the capital endowment fund as set out in attachment in just just better sit out and catch Medina 's not sorry was it was it an attachment een it is it is is is there an easy way for me to spoke to put a vote against the crusher chinzy because I assume it 's just the crash it chains need one for you to Yanni does it okay so councillors Johansson and Templeton recorded their vote against the allocation to Christchurch in seed from the capital endowment fund is it right yep good now so now now but I 've got the balance of the rating one to put here by okay so I 'll put that resolution all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carriage did someone say no oh yeah it 's all of the raids yeah so you 're voting against any rates being applied at all against the rates [Music] right just seems so short I said 24 all right good meetings can you just clarify the levels of service which it 's just it 's hard because we have different resolutions than what you 've got so the numbers don 't align but um in terms of the levels of service is that sorry what are you referring to what part of the agenda are you referring to oh I just wanted to clarify whether the levels of service have been adopted and under what resolution yeah yeah but I 've got we 've we 've got of service now so once the LTP was concluded we 're moving into a review of the levels of service yes it 's recorded in my resolution that we 've already passed it we passed it last Friday at the council noting the recommendation of the mayor 's external advisory group request the chief executive to report back by 31 August 2018 with a plan for undertaking over a few of levels of service noting priority areas such as relating to safe and secure drinking water roads footpaths and active travel and citizens participation decision-making also noting that changes to levels of service that were made in the draft LTP and confirmed as part of the adoption of the LTP will also be part of that review we 've already passed that that does that because I 'm reading a lot of attachment okay right okay so on that note thank you all very much I declare the meeting closed thank you _"

    "text": "everyone good morning of counselors could take their seats thank you that would be this morning 's meeting with recording the service of Ruby Fowler who passed away two weeks ago now Ruby Fowler served as a christchurch city councillor from 1986 to 1989 she was 98 years old when she passed away peacefully on Wednesday the 13th of June Ruby led a long and eventful life having been a teacher by profession I knew who very well through the Sydenham labour electric committee she was a stalwart of the New Zealand Labour Party the time she served as a councillor was a period of significant change as the city prepared itself for amalgamation with the other local bodies operating in the city at the time during this time she worked on the South Christchurch community board and at the Sydenham community centre ruby was a strong supporter of libraries their role in the community and the need for services to be accessible for all in 1988 she facilitated the formation of the Friends of the library who was still around today and the reason that she got involved with becoming user paced and she was bitterly opposed to that occurring Ruby remained an active member of the Friends of the library until her health declined in her later years at aint age 90 she called for a rates revolt and protests over the government setting of he can councillors Ruby Fowler made a wonderful contribution to her city whose was a life well-lived may she rest in peace and could I invite counselors and others and attendants to absolute a minute 's silence and we memory thank you very much I have no apologies i award declarations of interest the first item following those is the report from the audit and Risk Management Committee that the information is received that we note the recommendations and confirm the authority of the mayor and the chief executive to sign the letter of representation to audit New Zealand so would council imagine would you like to move that and seconded by Andrew Turner I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that is carried the next item that I would like to move is that five and the Standing Orders that we are suspending are that members may speak only once limits on the numbers of speakers general procedure for speaking and moving motions foreshadowed amendments and lost amendments do I have a seconder for that Andrew I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that is carried and the next item on the agenda is the moving of the recommendations that are set out in my name but before I do that could I invite the chief executive to speak to the matters that have been identified in a number of the submissions and are being progressed by staff as operational matters and then I will be asking you to note these in accordance with our consideration of the recommendation so I 'll hand over to cut any words thank you thank you Mir just congratulations and getting to this point I know it 's been a significant amount of work both for accounts in star for the last nine months and and particularly tricky in terms of challenging in terms of balancing out all the issues time so we had more than 1,500 submissions and as you know who 'd three hundred organizations and groups over time over the course of that not only did people talk about some of the issues and the content of the draft long term plan but also raised a number of issues particularly around that core business in getting things the basics right so we 've put together a summary of some of the things that people talked about in terms of things that we can just get on and do and so they listed for you in this memorandum that I 've tabled and it 's also on your advice in the Big Ten can there may be other things that we 've missed but generally I think it 's a good summary of the things that people talking about about the way that we work and the things that we need to do with our community so that 's just to give you some reassurance that we 've heard from those submitters and already working on some of those those issues and we 'll come back to you your deliberations over the next few days with any other work that the organization will just get on and do thank you very much look I 'll just just before I move the mayor 's recommendations I just want to just talk just a little bit about process so that people understand exactly what 's happening today and then what will happen on Tuesday so the technically from you know technical point of view the recommendations for amending the the LTP are encaptured and Aamir 's recommendations so some of them sort of look like that they 're you know sort of relatively technical and they are so it 's not so so much it 's more of a technical process to have them all on block and within Amir 's recommendations there are elements within within the recommended well that haven 't been captured and the recommendations that individual counselors would like to test the meeting over so these and and these are amendments to the recommendations so we 'll be accepting amendments to the recommendations at this council meeting today and we will be voting on those today within the LTP itself there are elements that individual councillors would like to record their opposition to they 're not opposing the entire adoption of the LTP and they 're not opposing the entire block of recommendations and so we 're going to come up with a resolution that notes their individual councilors have recorded their vote against particular matters you know it might be elements of the Northern Corridor there might be elements of particular projects whatever and that 's perfectly in order so we 're finding a mechanism and the sort of kind of block voting arrangement for individual councillors to express their opposition to elements of it nobody 's going to agree to absolutely everything on an occasion like this so we 're looking at a mechanism to easily record how that might be best recorded for that for for posterity I tend not to do that myself because as the mayor I have to speak for the decision of the council regardless of whether I personally agree with the approach that 's been adopted or not and then be and then so and we will debate 're going well today we will we will get to the point of adopting all of those coming back resuming standing orders and then formally adopting the mayor 's recommendations as amended by the meeting and noting the matters to be progressed by staff and the chief executives memorandum to the mayor as amended by the meeting so there may be issues that we want to record in terms of the operational work that the staff are doing as well and then the last thing that we will do is adopt the information and documents set out and attachments C to H and L of the staff report so the one reports that we 're going to hold on to as the infrastructure strategy and we 're just doing some tidy-up of the wording of elements of the infrastructure strategy that will then go to the audit office they will have that on for Monday and we will adjourn the meeting essentially till Tuesday morning and when we come back on Tuesday morning we will have the Audit Office sign-off that we require to proceed and then we will receive is when we will all make our major contributions to the overarching long term plan so there will be if I was still in Parliament it would be the general debate really actually it would be the debate on the budget so the budget debate is a significant debate you aren 't getting what the MPs get you 'll get your three minutes to express your views about that and I think the process this time has been I mean it 's been challenging but it has been a lot better than it was the first time there are a couple of things that we 've had this time that we didn 't have last time and the first one is that we 've actually settled our insurance for a global settlement we didn 't know what that was going to be and we really didn 't have any sort of overarching concept of our finances so I 'd like to thank staff for the incredible effort that they 've put on I know that worked night and day I know that worked weekends and it has been an extraordinary just just with those so so so we 'll be a tuning today once we 've dealt with the amendments and we 'll be coming back adopting our infrastructure strategy and then completing that final stage of adopting the long-term plans so right so on that note I will move the adoption of the recommendations and noting the matters being progressed by staff and seconded by Andrew tuna and I will open it up for for amendments and yeah so amendments fair Sara good I have a seconder for that Dion so I just take it by okay all right so is there is there any discussion though Yanni Android staff in a position to answer questions on it means what the questions are yes okay so Yanni so much my question really is and and like if it doesn 't alter the program and and we know we 're going to get further funding from national entrance for anyway so that 's a backup you know I 'm supportive of getting the cycleways up I just want to make sure but in fact putting other cycleways forward isn 't if we 've already had interim agreement on those you only did you have a question okay more debate okay the rates and pet I 'm gonna I 'd assumed that there wasn 't a rates impact because it was bringing forward okay 2025 2026 and 2027 that in our media so it does give us an opportunity to resolve things in the next year and the National transport program we would look it and through the additional funding that we anticipate providing the connection from the northern part or to the parallel and we can start immediately so it would be dependent on wrong wrong cycle way way just bringing forward one year to another because we 're not planning on doing anything to do it we 're just bringing it forward without any proposal to defer anything else okay so um Tim so I guess my concern is when you come back to us with the impact on rates there would be my only question is that see that there 's an EM page but it 's 25 26 and 27 so I mean we 've got time but if any increase that comes then I fixed something else yes so without a debate and discussion about what else that could other thing could be we 're still adding things onto so I mean that 's we 've had a hot a lot of time to discuss all of these things so somewhere along the line if we 're going to add something something falls off yeah I can 't agree to eating something not knowing what it is it 's going to come off okay I mean that 's the debate so yep yep and so the rate so the increase is actually yeah no no I mean it 's that that 's the debate and and and we can I mean we heard a lot of submissions on this one on the port Hills Road and the dangers on that road so you know I 'm I 'm Overmind us to support this one so do there is debate on it Jonnie yeah I mean I 'm strongly in support of person fat I 'd actually like to see this one done so sooner than that is one of the most sensible locations for a cycle way in the entire city we 've tragically had a death along that state highway 74 but I think it was a pedestrian there are numerous concerns with the industrial traffic that go through this area we 're actually building a cycle way that 's going to finish a very busy intersection with almost nowhere to go in fact I 'll be going contrary to the traffic that 's currently coming one way into the past the ternary and Garland 's right so you know this makes a lot of sense to do the circle way it will both be popular I think for commuting and also for recreation and I think that 's the key thing that we heard a lot of submissions about people feeling safe and having off road separated cycle ways I think is definitely the way forward it is there is an irony about this route and and that is that when the development was approved for the kin away farm site there was a requirement to provide cycling and pedestrian access along the same variation to the consent and council agreed to allow some yellow lines painted on the road to stop parking and a little bit of undergrounding paid for by the developers and they got away from having to provide that public amenity for the cycle and the pedestrian but this just makes a lot of sense it 's probably one of the least contentious cycle ways that we will ever do in the city because it 's mainly off-road and it serves a very strong cycling community and recreational route so in Andrew I 'd really like to support those I have to say but there is a rates in Pete and I think kind of like okay extra cycle additional cycle ways coming in at the last minute isn 't really going to help a whole program I think we need to take the public with us we had a lot of deputations both ways on the cycle ways I 'd love it to go ahead and in time it will surely the answer is that when the National Land Transport program comes to us that we make sure that I have every confidence they would but I think that would be a bit of process than deciding on one or two today the content earlier on the northern line that makes total sense and I 'm sure I will support that when it when that amendment comes like I cannot support this one particularly because sadly there is a impact on rates and I cannot agree with it we 're dealing with an amendment at this late stage we 've had some good answers from staff on the rates impact which is minimal and is in the further plan obviously we can deal with that impact if it requires smoothing in future annual plan or long-term plan processes and it is a very small impact we 've also heard as a result of questions to staff that it doesn 't involve pushing out any other cycleway or further deferral or abandoning any other project so on balance and I mean the Port Hills Road is a road that I Drive every day and with the recent posting of the new 60 kilometre speed limit it is a dangerous road 't think I would want to cycle down that road I can see that the impact of the cycle way for those that do and we heard from a number of people in the heath Cooke community in particular who will use that cycle way I could see that the impact would be very positive so given the the minimal impact on rates and the fact that it 's further out in the in the long term plan years and given the fact that it 's not impacting on any other delivery of the cycle waste program on balance I 'm supportive of this one turn in Mike thank you I think this is actually a priority of the raising the speed limit on this ride is ridiculous from singer 50k to 60k if you look see the city to surf there 's an absolute nightmare and my communities actually affected a lot more than many others with regards to the rep running dodging the road of a million sets of lights you think Chum streets beard what about brown street so my community is the trucks jumpin on Kashmir so I know this well and my communities told me and tells me continually that this is a problem which it does so I but we 've also got a document here that we 've put out to the public we 've started rates at five point five percent down over the next ten years to two point nine percent so I would agree to looking at Barratt prioritizing our cycleways and the regards not with rates but with safety needs and this would be a party but I can 't agree to this with any adjustment right over the next ten years because we have heard from our ratepayers and it 's the ones that are sucked they have locked and incomes the elderly or those on some kind of benefits etc with their own homes they are struggling with 5.5% so with the promise that we have given to go from 5.5 percent are the next 10 years to 2.9 I 'm sorry I would agree to an adjustment with our priorities without any effect on rates in this so I can at the stage support this Mike hit Expressway was you know it 's been consulted with the community we 've obviously go into the tenor at the moment but the last section has been delayed this is a section in a community that he wants the cycleway with him so many people when they submitted in person about actually how dangerous the roads are around it 's good and the need for this way a lot of written submissions talked about this cycle where it 's actually really important that we move forward on this sooner rather than later and like Yoanna also ii would like to see it a little bit more forward but we are standing above the amount of rates we have in the first few years but any opportunity to bring this cycle way forward I think we need to to leap at it is important we 've got a lot of people now one into cycle a lot of children actually want to cycle but you know in Christchurch we have doubled the average national rate of cycle incidents and we can improve that for for school children we need need clean thank you I 'm confused on this in the preamble to the LTP it says we will also consider prioritizing other cycle ways including Green spine we tried put up and our workshops of the article I live in River corridor what 's the National Land Transport program has announced so does this actually particularly set a precedent whereby we could promote others I mean I would have liked to promote it because we still have to wait for well this is the debate yep under debate environment yeah so so I 'll just say a couple words and then go into Syria to wrap up but I understand what people are saying about it that the reality is is that we know that most more funding is coming I think they 're having heard the submissions you can 't argue against this one because of the dangers of the Port Hills Road so so I 'm going to support it but I 'm gonna say to staff that we 've got to find a way of making sure that we get rid of that rates and Pete I fundings coming and that 's the difficulty with us during our LTP now and the funding coming a little bit later so I 'm very supportive of it Sarah thank you was due to be finished this year it was the original plan it was gonna be finished in 2018 and for the community pushed out when they really wanted one and this one does follow a rail corridor which does make it much easier much less contentious it 's not just he 's get but the the tourists coming to the gondola theorem adhere to Japan and there 's a significant number of cyclists in Littleton who busts through the tunnel and hop off hop off the bus and hop on their bikes again and Heath getting we heard from some of them as well that they would like this bought through and I think at some stage finding a way for the Littleton residents to bike through the tunnel would be amazing but if we don 't bring this funding forward we not only continue to update this community and put them in danger but we have a for the major cycleways programs so we 've bought through a couple in the maze recommendations already which has been tastic and brought them right up the front and what sets mean if there 's a hole in the funding which means that we wouldn 't be able to make the most of the NZTA funding in those years if we didn 't have enough of our own funding on budget to do that and so having this funding bought forward closes that hole in the actual prioritization of which cycleways get brought forward when we know the ins eto funding funding assistance rates will be done later this year when we know what those funding assistance rates are it is it 's a pain that we don 't know those now we can 't budge it for them we know they 're coming but but we need to do this and I 'd like to see this cycle way forward much through that and I 'm sure they later this year we 'll be able to have a look at that as well Thanks right I 've put the no can you put up your hands for know East Galloway Gulf Clearwater Skindred so that 's carried thank you and we might as well deal Mike Davidson with your amendment it 's good yep what you 're happy too sick and their poor name is there in discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye there 's a person no it 's carried thank you thank you right Sara in the in the governance and decision-making processes section of the Meuse recommendations where it talks about the the new reports in having some more clarity on a reports I 'd like to change the wording where it currently says we 're relevant address opportunities to demonstrate climate change leadership and I 'd like to change that to address the impacts of decisions on our climate change commitments of knowledge that many of the things we do have an impact on our climate change commitments and sometimes those are positive and sometimes they 're not so and I think that acknowledging both of those is really important not just the positive ones yep seconded by Vickie aye those opposed they no that 's carried thank you who else had an amendment Aaron I 've just passed mine up for typing oh well we 'll wait till it 's tight then it 's pretty short it 's very simple I had a noting provision okay well would you like to sit one on them yeah yeah is it to go into is that to go into Koreans report or is it yes is that what we went over the carbon sinks okay so just just move it as and I 'm is a noting provision okay just this noting provision we can happen at the end that the council explore with the government opportunities for carbon sequestration by way of tree planting including but not limited to the green spine and the resilience red zone the banks peninsula the walls Lee 's Craig Croft area and other suitable areas in the crisis City District there 's already planting going in some places but it 's the intentionality of that I think it would be good Kevon sequestration forestry did you want to be part of the emissions some additional money if you can it might be a we and we can do it anyway also just want to do a no Tim provision under hogs Protoss in parks that staff report back to Council by December 2019 on the playground and recreational facilities near we 're playing included options for youth facilities in the popular reward those opposed say no that 's carried thank you any other amendments it was yummy so just trying to get some information from staff over Heathkit in Oak Street the streets are in bad shape and the skirt repairs unfortunately didn 't well they can 't drain basically and I would have thought they were a renewal priority staff have just advised that they 're not on the renewal list which was different to my understanding but regardless we 're currently consulting on the Walton village master plan so I want noting that the council is currently consulting on the Woolston village master plan that we are one project and that depending on the outcome of that consultation that consideration is given to aligning the Heath Kurt and Oak Street projects so we 've got a huge amount of work happening along on both sides of those two streets along Ferry Road and along the river we were doing the dredging and there will be significant impact and previously the council resolved that the community board was able to come to Council and bring forward the WL projects to get synergy but we 're in the middle of consulting and so I don 't want to predetermine the outcome and I appreciate that we 've got budget issues it just would be really good to have a process by which we could actually effort made sense because it was more cost effective and we had the synergy that we could do that work together so I think that makes good sense does anyone want to second that that motion Andrew any discussion I 'll put that motion Oh that 's it if if there are synergies yeah it doesn 't actually require the work to be done as a report will come once the consultations done on the Williston did you write so yes at the moment we 're in the to enable the community board to request the bringing forward of the WL projects if it makes sense part of the issues that have been raised through the consultation is lack of parking and removal parking there 's been a lot of confusion over the side streets because there 's yellow lines and so yeah so it 's basically just to enable council to consider would still have to come in front of Council but we we would have to decide to actually proceed to do that so that gives us an able it enables us to consider it in the context of the next annual plan and you 'd probably save yeah or the budget because you 'd have the same overhead rather than having two different procurement or three different procurements I think you know this but this aligns with my amendment our old recommendation and getting back to getting the basics right that the very first the very sorry this is she I went through all of these notes I haven 't haven 't_''_3332.7 got an updated copy the the very first recommendation under getting the basics projects has been scheduled that consideration has given two opportunities to achieve synergies with related projects and the same or nearby facility in order to deliver greater cost-effectiveness and timely delivery across projects and this one says is in the process of being consulted on so I think actually calling it out as an example of where that could happen so it 's not a an active commitment to the project right now it shouldn 't have a write some page yes thank you so I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they no that 's carried Thank You Unni do you want to sorry I 've lots of tape is anyone else got do anyone else have any minutes sorry it 's commitments on the chart climate change one the word was commitments at the because we the impacts about decisions aren 't on our policies right I 'll make sure that 's changed okay thanks right Erin you 've got yours now he do yes so under page eight bullet point five point three so it 's just sticking with the Emir one word which was in your recommendation head the with option two options including traffic lights is one of those options it 's um III don 't know whether staff want to comment on that or not I 'm I 'm over mind to think that that 's that that 's fair enough it 's got to be one of the options that 's considered right okay so what well I 'm perfectly happy to adopt it as part of that we don 't need to move it as an amendment I 'm perfectly happy to accept it as part of the recommendation yep thank you very much meeting me thank you very much councillor Curie nice doing business with you okay so yeah Nia we got are we back to you now sorry I haven 't got all of yours proposals in front of me a Yanni I 'm I would rule some of these out of order so so I just and some of the some of them I mean the asking you were both being recorded that we 're dealing with there and a process right so rebate being put towards the repair rebuilding of council social housing units I wouldn 't accept as a an amendment on the basis that we would need staff advice we would need information in front of us in order to make a decision on us so I don 't believe that we could make an informed decision advice from staff they 've seen through the tables of the unallocated amount there it 's also shown that there 's been very limited uptake I 've had email saying that we 're carrying forward thirteen million dollars I think on these DC rebates so I just would like some opportunity to definitely vote against the unallocated amount continuing and actually put it towards something else in the budget or just take it off altogether but I don 't know what the best way to do that is there has been lots of advice we 've had submissions and support of rebuilding a social housing I think you 've got access to this way of dealing with that if you just want to invite record it against it is that the best thing the counselor wants to do it 's possible for you to entertain an amendment at this stage on that issue if the counselor wants to vote against it you can but what 's the I mean I I 'm just trying to understand the framing of it won 't_''_3702.2 Susan the LTP will sit on the record at this meeting the expiry date and it just doesn 't something we borrow so so originally we 've had the presentation from region or at Christchurch and they were gonna report back on the incentives blueprint Central City plan part of this was developed through that idea and when we last heard from regenerate it was expected that we would be briefed prior to finalizing the LTP so that some of these things we you know we could have a bit more evidence place well we had a discussion about this at the development forum yesterday so I just think that I understand what you 're trying to do but we don 't have the advice in front of us right is there a process that we can get where we can thing is being used the region are reviewing the central city plan and actually nothing to do you seem to have in your head that development contributions that for gone so would have been paid other than for the rebate is somehow money sitting on budget it isn 't and I don 't know how we can we but we budget for as occurring but isn 't money that exists I mean maybe if we could dc 's 101 from the end of the table because I don 't know how many times that needs to be explained before somebody can understand it could could somebody I don 't know this time to rebate 101 session is what 's been explained to the council 's of more times than I can count and I just don 't think now is even an appropriate time to do it anyway I wonder if organization we bring back the DC policy to council and have a workshop on it and in some discussion around there it 's a good idea so so I 'm not I 'm not accepting that one playground which get information since Monday so apologies for the late notice it 's a local it 's a small local project with a relatively small budget but it is quite frustrating that the projects being delayed and there doesn 't seem to be any ability to have a consideration of how it gets funded so I 've just wrote it as a kind of minor thing can we just can we pop that into the enter the chief executives list as well because we know that the money has been allocated to Thompson Park ever generally speaking to we were told and we that if you want to substitute something it has to be in your own ward so here we have a Council of us trying to take money out of an adjoining world to fund something in his ward as far as Glen and I are concerned we weren 't very comfortable with the Horseshoe Lake and Thompson Park situation and effectively and found a bit of extra money for some planting so I think the council should be looking for money from its own approach that this is being done there and it 's the question is why can 't the whole lot work be done as well and that 's why I 'm just gonna say that can I just take a take bit into the chief executives one and that they will do some work on on how they could resource that that final element of the upgrade land drainage issues in order to to get that whole project done so to be clear because I am a little bit concerned that the two counters somehow think that I 'm taking money off Thompson Park or course she liked her she like was deferred to enable Thompson Park to go ahead in Thompson Park is about half the cost of Horseshoe Lake so basically there 's an interest component that 's saved by not doing Horseshoe Lake which is not something that I 've put forward that 's the advice that staff have given that it won 't be ready to be done until a certain time so there 's an actually an interest saving in that so there was no desire to delay the what understand what you 're trying to do but let 's leave it to the chief executive from an operational point of view to find a way of achieving that consistency thing took us by surprise so we didn 't see it coming yeah yes I was trying to sleep when their email came through so no no no no I think I think we 're there I think we 've got all of the amendments on the table so the northern are to extinction is currently under construction the issue now is the downstream effects everything else is as in process so we can 't vote against there it 's only being constructed downstream effects I think that 's what councillor your Hanson 's talking about and this from an asteroid set 15 million dollars on budget for there yeah I 'm just sorry they 're not they 're not amendments are sorry I already said that we 've got a process for dealing with it can we just take number four out it wasn 't sorry I had you I hadn 't noticed that had gone up sorry that Linwood Paul resolution no no you can 't ask until I 've got a mover in a seconder so it 's been moved by Yanni and seconded by Sarah so so that 's the that 's the resolution so I 'm sure that council you 're hence and we 'll take a question through the chair from the chair of the infrastructure transport Environment Committee very improvement yep very improvement in my view signifies quite a negative outcome I think actually enhanced value by seeking partnerships which has certainly been a focus of the submissions as a bit of way of saying saying it so you know I think very improvement should be something we do across all of our projects it shouldn 't be just specified to one particular project and you know I think that 's the idea for this Lynwood one is that we do want to work collaboratively with the community with people that have expressed an interest and look at enhance value but I am concerned that the woods value improvement have a different connotation and that 's why I suggested an amendment does anyone improvement is actually should also be across all their projects because it 's about delivering the same outcome but are the more efficient and cost-effective manner want to move that we do that across all the projects no no we 're in debate and I 'm going to enter into this debate down so does anyone else want to say anything Sarah you know the words technically mean kind of the same thing it 's just the implications are different one seems a little punitive in the other one sees hey let 's do what 's best and I think that we should go for the let 's do what 's best option well I I 'm gonna vote against this amendment and the reason is is that we sit around this table representing the city not individual wards not individual projects we represent the city and if we don 't expect value improvement from all of our projects then I just think that we 're not doing our job as councillors I think that the city of Christchurch expects us to get good value for the money that we out in the in the proposal for partnerships with other organizations that may seek to co-locate or co-organized their arrangements you know when you look at the opportunities for clubs to co-locate with a with a council swimming pool I mean what a fantastic opportunity it is for that whole Park you know that whole area the amenity will be lifted immeasurably but we have to look at more cost-effective ways of delivering things and there is not a negative it 's actually a positive it 's not a cost to the community it 's an investment in the community so I would like the words value improvement to remain there because enhanced value might might actually mean the complete opposite which is not looking for those opportunities to save money for the wider community of Christchurch so that 's why I 'm voting against I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's lost thank you the levels of service for social housing can we leave that tool after we do the levels of service and the next iteration we 've by August September proposals here yeah no way we would we couldn 't do this based on the advice that we have at the moment this is significant yeah this is the this is a significant change we couldn 't do it off the back of this amendment we couldn 't just increase the levels of service for social housing by 500 over the next ten years based on this no we can 't change that labels the sense they drive the organization so we can certainly we could certainly note that we have an aspiration to increase the levels of social housing in the city over the next 10 years and to look for partnership opportunities to achieve that but we 're not going to change our levels of service based on us so you can leave it at that or if we 're gonna get a chance to reconsider right so I think we 're done on the amendments good right well look thank you all very much and and now we 'll debate the recommendations as as amended and and I 'll just kick that off briefly today and talking about process I actually referred back to the last long term plan and when I introduced the city 's first post-earthquake long term plan and it was the very first long-term plan that the council conducted after the earthquakes you might remember that just in 2013 it was a three-year plan that was adopted not a not a ten-year plan and and that was for very good reason the same things happened in Kokoda and Renee they 've been that they 've been laid off their obligations to do the full long term plan process because of the situation that they found themselves in but that means that the council was facing significant financial uncertainties and as I said before since then we 've negotiated a global settlement of our insurance claim and we have a much better understanding of our financial situation but also the true state of our horizontal infrastructure and I think for me it has been of real concern and it has been all around this table I know that every single one of you have expressed this concern that the scoot program as the council had been expecting so when the previous council went into the long term plan and sorry went into the cost-sharing agreement with central government they basically we 're confident that what they were signing up to was an agreement to fix everything that was broken and to share the costs of that on an honor on an equitable basis so it was a 40 split on the horizontal infrastructure excluding roads it was basically an 20 split on the roads it didn 't cover footpaths unfortunately but it was a significant contribution to the to that to the cost and and what we got back after the skip program was completed was far less than the repair of everything and that 's because the cost-sharing agreement was written in a way that really hadn 't been properly interpreted by the previous council and that was it was only the essential network restoration that was covered by the 6040 and the 20 split and that has caused this council to reflect on the true state of its assets and how we 're going to take things forward from the submissions we have heard over and over and over again get back to basics get the basics done get the basics right the basics was mentioned over and over and over again it 's about pipes it 's about roads it 's about footpaths the other priority for the city right now we 've got to get on top of us and we 've got to get things right they also said to us because we did some trade offs and said have we got the balance right and actually the people Christchurch said not there 's there 's an element that you haven 't got right and that is as you 're prepared to compromise the wastewater we don 't want you to compromise the wastewater and so we 've addressed that as well so we 've put money on budget for the wastewater we 've put more money on budget for the for the roading and the footpaths and we 've really tried to focus on getting those basics right the the message also came through loud and clear about what we what we value in terms I just want to mention chlorine so when we when we started off down this process we we didn 't know what we didn 't know the plan was pretty much locked down at the time that we had to make the decision to temporarily chlorinate our water our our residents have come back to us and said to us loud and clear you get that chlorine out of the water and we remain committed to doing that and we that does mean that we have to increase our budget we brought forward the budget significantly in order to be able to achieve that another message that came through loud and clear was that Christchurch needs a fit for purpose Stadium that can attract major sporting events and and and the time is right to make that a priority the government has signaled with the capital acceleration fund that they 've got money that they can bring to the table I don 't think the public of Christchurch were actually aware that the cost-sharing agreement had no financial contribution to the stadium from the government guaranteed other than the land money available to support us we can bring the stadium forward and our budget it 's it 's still not as far forward in our budget as it would have been if the original cost-sharing agreement had been adhered to but we had to push it out when we didn 't know what we didn 't know we feel that this gives us the time for central government to come in with with the first tranche of the funding that 's required we are going to require others to join us and partnering to fund the stadium because our contribution is kept at 253 million and I 'm certainly very interested in looking for options that reduce our contribution as well so it 's it hasn 't been an entirely easy process has been easier than the last process in some ways and harder than the last process and others still don 't think we 've got the engagement with our community right the the hearing of submissions process although they 're you know it 's an important part of the democratic process I think we do need to find supermarket that the the various cultural activities and festivals and things all year round perhaps were the presence that actually engages people and all of the issues that the council 's involved in so thank you very much for all of the hard work that I know that all of you have done and and I 'd now like to sort of perhaps pass that around the table so I 'll start off with you Vicki no no oh these are the amendments yeah the recommendations in the amendments sorry it 's about mostly the whole thing so we 've got to I think there 's been huge work that 's gone into it we 've learned that the scale of damage was as you say the things I don 't think we would have got through this earthquake in Christchurch City heat of the disaster and its ownership with assets because if we look at what CC HL has been able to provide it 's been amazing I agree completely that the chlorine has to be taken out and that 's it 's great that the money has been in a loan for social housing so that it 's rich neutral but it means that that we are still continuing to build social housing I think that 's really really important if you look at the fact that the demand for social housing is going to increase and increase and increase over the next 30 years I love that we 've got the shared equity fund and or to help people buy their first house and and the Arab he has gone out to providers for this this week educational training and I really like that we 've got the green prescription continuing and that we 've helped converse recycling remains a huge problem for every council in New Zealand and probably many around the world in terms of how we recycle recyclables given that China has closes its doors and that the market has been flooded we have a big challenge ahead of us in that I like the fact that we 've maintained the momentum and this and this long-term plan I think it 's really important that we maintain a sense of hope and confidence and that there this is a city of opportunity I think there are things that we would love to have addressed I would love to have addressed water bottling and the fact that it should not be allowed to be it 's a resource that should not be allowed to be taken and should not be allowed to be put into bottles of plastic which may be manufactured on-site those things give me the heebie-jeebies and just not part of what we want for the city but in terms of have we looked at the basics addressed those addressed the key issues and tried to move the city forward in a way that is about Christchurch and the inclusiveness that is Christchurch and the social equality that we want to provide and the social inclusiveness that we want to provide to make this a great place for everybody who lives here too to live here so I think it 's actually really good perfect timing yadi you want us to redo the whole thing or just the amendment it 's the mayor 's recommendations as amended there 's gonna be Jim same things but you know I mean it 's the Me 's recommendations as amended don 't have to you know the what 's come through really clearly is I I still think we 're a city divided there 's there 's a city that of people that see the future that have it pretty good and see the opportunity and love the kind of glitz and the glamour of what 's ahead and then there 's a side of the city that 's still struggling with the impact of the earthquakes for all these years old part of the problem as I see it has been that the original financial strategy of council was to while the repairs were being done was to do renewals at the same time rather than duplicate projects unfortunately that hasn 't happened in fact the opposite has happened and the worst worse has happened and that there appears that we got have meant that some streets can 't drain properly that they 're deteriorating quicker than they would have otherwise and so a lot of the money that 's been spent from skirt than was anticipated which means we 've got a huge cost going forward this still I think a huge challenge in the city between looking after the basic needs of people like housing community funding in local facilities versus the central city and the huge expense that 's been put into things like the stadium so III really think I commend the mayor for coming up with a number of recommendations to try and address getting energy you know often we 're told that things are going to cost more and the idea that we should only value improve one project I think is a little bit sad in fact we should be looking at a number of opportunities to save money and reduce costs and I think there 's a there 's ways in which we can do that and I 've seen my colleagues two examples last night but I could just many more I think one of the concerns I have is we 're not finishing existing cycle ways and we 're starting new ones and I really kind of struggle with that I would have thought and its total if you want to see the impact but we 're not we 're not doing that which is said so finally I just want to address the issues in Lemoore because I do think that you know I am said that we value improving the Lynwood facility when we haven 't done that for any of the others and I think it sends quite a negative connotation this is a community that just recently had a Salvation Army report saying that it felt forgotten and that its voices weren 't being heard through this process we 've had a number of submissions and support and welcoming the the Linwood Woolston poll and yet we 've come up what I believe is quite a negative amendment it 's a community that said its bus services just cut yesterday by ikan and some parts and it 's a community that 's struggling to get the basic specs post-earthquake so yeah I was really said that we 've passed that amendment I don 't think think it sends a good signal that they should have to do with less when so thank you for the work that 's been done on this I still have concerns with the quantum of funding in the prioritization of where it 's going thank you Tim thank you and this has been a long journey it seems but I just want to pass on my thinks I 'm sure Mike inspect for my colleagues to Caroline your staff they 've done an amazing metalwork this has been a very hard juggle and the conditions in the city that we are in but and we all love our city and we want it to move so that 's really the priority so I think that this our long-term plan has really achieved a lot of things you know people already talked to the other concern owe the debt Headroom the the cost-sharing that the gaps editors have left and the true cost of that but we have to move forward and one of those things and Leanne pointed it out with regards to we are councillors elected an award but the ward that we represent us at Christchurch anchor or all the wards of Christchurch is economic benefit positive economic benefit to this city so I am absolutely really chuffed that we are moving forward that multi-use arena to 2020 124 I think that 's outstanding and I really look forward to working with the Minister for Christchurch Megan woods dr. Megan woods and achieving as best cost-savings we can for the best value that we can get there is a concern there though that we do not lose the vision of what that is all about about putting the economic benefit into the central city and other places in Christchurch so those private partnerships that we look at we must be really careful about what they want and we 've got to keep our focus on what 's best for Christchurch Bank secondly with regards to what we heard from our communities about road safety and it 's great to have it in the ER that the council gives high and immediate priorities for increased road maintenance and Road Safety specify zhing intersections and around schools and that is absolutely crucial to our and all our immediate communities and it 's great to see by five point 1 million and increasing from there to over the next few years so I think that is essential and I look forward to working with staff about how we achieve that in our communities and all our communities the final things thing I 've got just under a minute as the integrity of this count so I talked about the elected members not the council staff we 've put in this long-term plan the schedule of our rates increases starting at five point five and decreasing in the next five years to five percent and the final five years of this long-term plan from 4% to two point nine percent we 've just had a discussion earlier on about putting in something that may well affect rates increases further down the trick but those people in our city that are on fixed incomes need to be able to have faith in this council that they can plan and adjust for the future and if we 're going to just throw things and without taking things out I 'm sorry I just cannot stand it we 've got benefits in fixed income so I really think we 've achieved this and in ten years going down to 2.9 achieving everything that we have set out to do looking forward and positively to the future for all our communities I think that 's gonna be um I think we 've achieved it and thank you again very much to the staff in my colleagues thanks to our clean thank you preparation for this I had a quick look at International also national surveys on the issues that matter the most for New Zealanders they included economic issues housing homelessness second social issues and via mental issues etc and that 's from a Roy Morgan poll the latest that I could find if I surveyed my own household and the youngest they said save the environment once he 'd vegetarian butchers he also said it makes the hydras slide it can we free because you 're the counselor they go to a place called unlimited ones in the home they talked about getting rid of the chlorine in the water fixing the but also having a stadium and I think the city are it 's not necessarily as straight out kind of dichotomy between one or the other we live in a strange tension of needs we do have to attend to the most basic and I can definitely say in my part of the world that fixing the roads is a community well-being issue for many you can 't get away from that as is putting back community facilities so that people have a place to go in the long journey to recovery my sense is that this tension of needs will remain in our city for some time and that it won 't be easily resolved and that of course we feel it is the local decision-makers and but that at some point we just have to push the Go button and make hard decisions decisions which will also be at times unpopular just quickly looking at a couple of other issues the red zone presents for us an amazing opportunity to do something different just a bit of training recently took me out to bottle Lake and even in deplorable weather people love nothing more than just whatever and I think in the red zone if we can provide a great amenity there for people to enjoy that will be part of their recovery as well it can also be a carbon sink and part of us leading the way as a city in terms of housing what I would say about social housing when you provide for it it 's a bit like spark plugs in a car it goes well you take one of the spark plugs out it starts to chug and for the bus housing is a system you need every part in the system functioning well or it falls to bits as we can see with the I think it 's twenty-three thousand homeless on the streets of Auckland so we 're in the hundreds as far as I 'm aware but we do need to pay attention to each part no good having a stadium if people come here and see people living on the streets so let 's you know attend to to all the work we can across our housing yep and ask for your support on that Thank 're he 'd never hated well to that warning hints got myself in plenty of situations and today won 't be any different I was always seeing myself as the odd one in and and that 's why I will start by first thinking that mirror and my fellow counselors for getting something that 's been dear to my community which is around a particular intersection and we 've got a way forward we 'll see a report back to our community board in September with some options and we 'll see what the community sees and the community board sees about that at that time and move on so that 's all my good bits this and some great parts in this in this LTP I think Christchurch does here for most parts a really good future ahead of it the present were still plenty of bits broken isn 't so good especially for those in particular parts of the city businesses and the inner city people who live in the East and around drinking chlorine I 've always been totally opposed to chlorine and probably always will be that I received an email yesterday from someone and be inside who 's got a family of four and the guy clearly stated that his rights bill is one month 's wages so one it wasn 't hot and he still got to pay insurance and he still got to pay his mortgage and he 's got to pay for his kids school fees and lunches and everything else they do is a family but one month 's income is just rates and I think our rates are out of control and crash ditch I think five and a half percent is far too high which would be a lot closer to the rate of inflation the difference here between I think most of my fellow councillors in myself is I 'm cheap I 'm a I 'm a cheap guy I think I see myself as pretty average I grew up in average neighborhoods and I 'd even if I could afford a Ferrari I 'd never buy one I 'd always buy Ford most likely wouldn 't leave me by most the ones I like but if I Toyota because it 's reliable and does the job what we haven 't done in this LTP is engage the public enough we 've had feedback from Lisa and one person in the population and so you were kind of got a mandate legally speaking but we don 't actually have a mandate from the people because they haven 't told us exactly what they want or more to the point what they don 't want and that those are the conversations going forward that I think a lot more councils and governments need to have with their populations is about how not to spend money a lot of stuff we build and I look at community facilities and the one that was removed from Sun ovens on Colombo Street what was called the Lyon Steen I thought was a standing facility I hired a number of times myself I thought it was really good value for money it was a really good building the cost of that one is just over 10% of the cost of the one we will build and so that cost afore intial is just haven 't done it during we haven 't asked enough questions around that in this LTP and I look forward to those conversations we will hopefully have going forward because I think I speak for a silent majority the 99% of the population not all of them because on our number of them hate me I sit on staff but that don 't engage with us and I look forward to them engaging with us more in the future after thank you I join others certainly and thanking the staff for a huge amount of work and also my fellow councillors I think there 's some sense the since we went out for consultation there 's some significant improvements that we are making and one that stand and one that stands up for me is the area of social housing and the recommendation to support the 30 million dollar loan for a social housing provider there I think that 's very timely we know that there 's a desperate need for a single and double bedroom units in social housing the figures from the Greater Christchurch partnership are very worrying people who are going to be only on superannuation and further people with disabilities so like yeah I understand that our current waitlist for example for social housing is over 500 people and one of our submitters you might remember said to us what if one of those 500 was your grandmother so what aunts have you got to there they said well I actually think by by actually now putting out the loan for the 30 million then in fact we will get the social housing which our staff have suggested that we will and they have estimated that over a three year period in fact we could get 190 social housing units built and that would be over an eight year period to we 'd be looking at 500 those are the figures that staff have previously given me so the other area to that I think there 's there 's been strong support for but also I think we 've been cautioned about is in the area of it cycleways I think what we 're doing is really good I 'm as I 've indicated I wasn them but I think putting in the two particularly besides what was voted today with the his cycleway quorum ins trail and parts of the northwest arc will go a long way towards achieving what we want is a as a city for a network in a system of cycling and we we certainly heard from in order matter of the value are for older people cycling and will so the value for people people 's health in the future care the other area that came through strongly for me and it 's close to my heart was the area of heritage and there was strong support from submitters that we put bring forward the bet Berlin landmark fund of one and a half million and I think it 's quite clear that the lane the lane these landmark buildings for example like the old post office in the square and and also the State Insurance Building in there 's the Peterborough corner they have been part of Christchurch 's identity and that 's something that I think that this that this budget attempts to do in terms of keeping to people in I think the public spoke very clearly about the importance of having a multi-use arena and that will give the certainly think that that will give the public the certainty as well as the other aspects of your budget so I certainly can become the Me 's recommendations thank you damn oh look at this budget as a three-stage thing getting the basics right we 're identifying getting those basics right getting things done and then delivering and I think the key part is actually delivery for us now we 're spending a lot of money this budget if you look through it there 's a lot of money being spent on things in our city getting things done and getting the basics right I remember sitting here when we adopted the draft long-term plan and saying I was disappointed that we weren 't maintaining our core basic infrastructure and I 'm really happy that we are now at least can say to our communities that the city 's foundation what we build everything else upon is actually going to be solid it 's not going to spending a lot of money on the health of our city we want to be a well being city we need us healthy city that actually people can build upon and actually want to invest and want to live in and actually get cool to build a life upon I 'm really happy to see a lot of momentum still staying within the Central City because we need to attract people to live in our central city we don 't have that at the moment we 're still 2,000 people living or 2,000 people less living in the Central City than when the earthquake happened and we 've got a long way to go to attracting more people to build their the getting things done part that I said in the second part is around the governance and decision-making process and the Meuse recommendations here around developing a committee for establishing well establishing a committee for the capital program there the council 's doing around 900 projects at the moment I don 't think many people in the city recognize how many projects this council was actually doing right now summer several hundred million dollars but 900 projects to govern to get things done in our city is a massive achievement and we actually need to have a very strong governance oversight on that and I 'm really happy that we 're actually going to a step something in that respects so that we can actually start looking at how we you know we 're talking about value engineering or value adding so we can actually stop wasting money in areas that don 't need to be wasted and actually prioritized where money can actually be spent because there is a limited amount of money and that 's the next part about delivery delivering all these projects is going to be tricky for the city our debt levels are going to soar and it 's the next generation that 's going to have to look at that debt level how do we pay for it at the moment we 're borrowing but I really think that in the future we 're going to have to look at our assets and prioritize how we actually manage our assets how we own city so that we can ever start paying for and actually enhancing the the city 's so that 's so I 'm pleased that we 're getting the basics right I 'm pleased that we 're going to be looking at how we deliver get things done and but the caution that I do have from my point of view is how we 're going to pay for everything in the future Pauline it 's true we did hear a lot of submitters talking about cool business but I 'd like to remind people that our roads and footpaths in three waters was actually well over 50% of our spend but even then we 've now increased the funding that we will be putting into our repairs of our footpaths and roads in also and to our renewals program because we 've listened and we also made provisions to up the maintenance of our parks and renewals and and including resourcing our Park Rangers which I think 's a really neat thing because it feeds into education programs and all sorts of wonderful things and we also heard from our with our footpaths and roads and and I agree that these do form the heart of our communities and it was our strong communities that really helped us get through the terrible disaster of the earthquake so we 've provided a hundred and seventy thousand to begin investigative work and to the the we 're what how when for any new ones and I think that 's a really good start and so and also we 're continuing on building collaborative relationships with our residents and communities and I note in the Mears forward you see that we want to work with our communities not just for our communities and I think that 's a really strong statement it 's also supported strongly by the the grant to the edge we 're Paul that indicates we 're walking the talk here finally recognizing that this was a great project and recognizing the durability and the passion and desire for the return of the pool and that 's worthy of support and I know that will build an enduring relationship there because that 's what it 's about it 's not communities and this will be a great example of how we do things in the future as deland referred to so along with the earthquake the floods the fires we now have the chlorination as year to deal with in the and the upgrading of our drinking water infrastructure which is a good thing and I think we 've stepped up to this really well and plus as I mentioned before additional funding for roads and footpaths and we 're still keeping the rates kept at the five point five nothing short of a miracle in my view and I know people still think that 's high and it is for some people no one 's disputing that but we do as Dion also say we do need to fund all these things somehow so it 's actually a good balance of our core responsibilities here was moving forward as in keeping the momentum in the city and which is really happening and also getting our core business done that balance is really really important and we 've based our decisions on the feedback we 've heard through the submissions with our residents not everyone gets what they want but I feel we 've done the best to provide a balanced way forward for the city of Christchurch normal to think everyone everyone around this table all the staff but also the Mema says the public is engaged with us to get us to this point today my thank you I think there 's some really good aspects of that the long-term plan and we 've definitely changed a few things from the draft to show that we are getting San to get the basics right you know focusing on our drinking water especially at a time when obviously there 's the chlorination issue is hugely important and put enough money on budget to sort that out is important not just for the short-term over the next eight months but also that the longer term to make sure acid is never permanently chlorinated spending more money on wastewater I think it 's really really important and we heard that a lot it 's also good to see extra money put into wrote in local rhodium maintenance and also safety you just to see what those people have to live with broken footpaths broken streets endless constructions from the Dudley Creek works you know community well-being is hugely important and you know fixing the roads helps their community well-being then we need to do it you know it 's time we listen to the to the people and act accordingly there 's been a lot of debate over the cycle waste and it 's really good to see that we are still pushing to if the cycle ways and we 're board have pulled another couple forward and we 've got enough money on budget that once the NZTA released their financial assistance rates there 's potential to speed them up and get them completed as originally planned although there 's a lot of comments that the cycle ways and wanted I think that 's completely completely wrong you just have to look at the long-term plans submissions to see that support of the cycleways drew the most submissions 282 in the majority and we 're asking for the Sauk waves to be brought forward and when you look at the not that many negative comments you know 26 negative comments and cycleways does not mean the city does not want it you know I 've spoken to many people around New Zealand and in Christchurch we know we 're the envy of the other cities they they want to be like us this is the perfect place for cycling and what we 've done so far was seen increased insightfully numbers and we know how important that is for a city moving moving forward as the growth continues to go you know currently though in the northern the corridor which is this gonna funnel thousands and thousands of extra vehicles into one of their older suburbs st. Albans it 's not going to fix congestion that 's going to make it worse and I know we went out on the consultation talked about a fuel tax you know that 's that 's not the answer we need to look at congestion Livi 's we can 't have people of Waimakariri come in and to enter christchurch and not contributed into actually the congestion that they are causing so there 's 's something cause I 've said right from the start our rates are too too high they 'll way too high you know it 's a ten year program and at the second half of it they are getting lower unfortunately be nice if we could actually stick to that ten year program long term plans every three years so I 'm looking at the next three years and I see a huge pressure on a number of people you know just come out cloth and these tight times could have easily saved two percent each year on our rates we 're spending twenty million dollars on private heritage over the next ten years there 's way too much you know we 're going to be giving Christ Eugene 's heed an additional 1.2 million dollars on top of the ten million dollars every year it 's just too much at this point of time you know we just need to be a little bit more prudent with our spending just to get over this tough picture I just think we 've missed the mark with there Sarah thank you doctoring through this process climate change leadership active citizenship and connected communities increasing active and public transport use the post prosperous and sustainable city proactive approach to natural hazards and a safe and sustainable water supply with improved waterways they are future focused and will enable us to become a more resilient city and closely reflect what our community has told us through the LTP consultation however is Joe Biden famously said don 't tell me what you value showing me your budget and I 'll tell you what you value and you know what this budgets our budgets doesn 't quite match your well-intentioned words and many aspects and our community has told us this through their submissions but that 's not for the lack of trying on our part to get this right to balance all the calls from residents and we also have funding issues still to be sorted we 're awaiting the government 's new Transport GPS to be finalized and the NZTA funding assistant rates we still have the business cases and the capital acceleration fund to go into global settlement with the government for more and get more essential work done without the impact falling on ratepayers I know that many will be disappointed that we have not brought forward all of the cycle waste projects they were the most positively commented on aspect of the LTP but without the NZTA funding rates confirmed it was simply too much of a hurt on rates however all 13 MCS are still on budget and we have added enough funding to complete them the cycleways all that 's right all in national and international evidence is clear in the new government direction is to use this evidence to build a transport system that actually works Christchurch is growing and we do not want to end up with Auckland 's congestion and disconnected communities we have a chance to be much better than late I think we 've got it pretty much right with our community facilities but was stunned when my taco taco taco the Summoner community centre opened and this award-winning building was only open to the community for three hours total on the weekend so putting some additional funding and to hit the library on Saturday and Sundays is really welcomed while the coastal pathway is in the later years of the LTP I 'm really pleased that we 've put on budget enough money to get there difficult monks basic complete the new plan for the GPS phone footpads should help make this much cheaper for ratepayers once those rates are finalized I will be having my vote recorded against a few of the recommendations so what is a few words why now I 'm in favor of a stadium and have been convinced by my colleagues that it needs a roof however I 'm not in favor of bringing it forward two years and in fact only 28 submitters asked us to do that for me it 's stadium boost core city infrastructure the two key reasons given for bringing the stadium forward certainty and it 's cheaper to build it the sooner you do it are the same or our core infrastructure we need to have the confidence that our waste water and drinking water up to modern standards and it will never be cheaper to do it now the stadium isn 't as important as getting our core infrastructure up to scratch as soon as possible trying to cut it now because I 've got too much left to say I can do more at the time only a month ago the council narrowly passed a resolution to allow the capital endowment fund inflation proving to be used for the next three years I only voted in favor of this because it was going to be the community uses all of the economic stuff had been used up and so I 'll be voting against it being used for the Christchurch in seed portion there and I 'm disappointed that we have not even inflation approved our community grants and know that the many community groups is submitted us to us we 'll be as well I 'm not looking forward to the really tough decisions that will have to make in the metropolitan strengthening communities funding round and September anyway I 'm looking forward to next year and the additional funding that we will have to truly become a 21st century sustainable and prosperous City Jamie thanks I won 's for Tuesday but I will briefly touch on the amendments here are we gonna do it all now yeah I will speak to the OT today don 't once and we 'll do it well getting synergies okay well I will be speaking to the OTP on the whole today and not Tuesday thank you very much suggesting the deferral of funding for a local pool additional park ranger funding and virus straws Green prescriptions and a swim program and the exploration of fuel tax these are all items that I haven 't supported in these amendments here I don 't get a lot of teacher from saying no to these things because I think they 're all good causes but our role is about making those hard calls no one ever said it was going to be easy identifying what you think you could do without there 's always way tougher than saying what you could what you could live with or what you could do with I 'm not in favor of bringing forward the major cycleways routes when our roads and footpaths remain in the state from the community is the importance of the expedited multi-use arena I 'm very much in favor of this and bringing the funding forward and I 'm very supportive and endorse our clear intention for it to be a closed roof facility missing that opportunity would just be a travesty so whilst some people and actually a lot of people would say that that stadia is a nice-to-have well I think it 's a need to have for the city is because there 's been a tremendous amount of investment that has gone and on the basis that this would happen and we 've got it honor that the reality is the crown and the council ain 't going to rebuild Christchurch it it 's largely going to be the private sector and we can do our part but fundamentally it has to come from external sources and I think that the crown councils need to hold up their end of the bargain I am in favor of the backed basis approach so I do endorse that theme but I think the biggest concern that I hold is the level top of mind and I don 't think this is isolated to Christchurch I think this is a local government problem across the nation that the level of rates rises a completely unsustainable and ultimately that house of cards will fall down because they 're rising it level was far faster than inflation and what people 's wages are at so at one point it 's going to come and we 're going to have to look at that we 're going to take with a you a GC with a uniform annual general charge next year and that 's been signaled and in the mayor 's recommendations I welcome that it 's still not going to be sitting the silver bullet and I think the last point I 'll make on on rates is that I think people can swallow the fact that they 're not always going to be even in that 's okay so long as their fear and the problem with their rating system is that isn 't fear I 've got a young couple that I know he works a 9 to 5 job as employs two to three people if their rates are thirty grand because they live in Finland their houses also ends as whereas there is simply not fear it 's it 's a blunt instrument of wealth text in someone 's capital value isn 't actually a good indication of someone 's wealth at the end of the day so we 're going to have to look at that we 're not doing that today though in the u AG C is going to be a start but the final point that I 'll make is that I 'm heartened by our commitment to be chlorine-free as fast as humanly possible I commend the mayor 's stance on this and I 'd really like to make it very clear that all of us around the council are unanimous and our desire to have this toxin gone from our water supply as soon as we possibly can and I think that not one person in Christchurch will begrudge a commitment that if we 're going to gold-plate one thing that it will be our water supply so well done to to the the hard work on this its long-term plan that 's compromise from from everyone but our one job is to sign off the budget and we 'll be able to do thank you in Matata omocha URI I 'm Marie Akane for us and our children after us this long-term plan is not just about making decisions that affect us today but we are making decisions that will directly affect the lives of our children and their children after them Thank You Leanne for your recommendations that I am delighted to support thank you to to my fellow councilors and to staff for the combined effort and a huge amount of work that 's gone into getting us to this place I think this reflects these recommendations reflect both what we have heard from our communities about what we should focus on and also it aligns beautifully with our strategic priorities that we that we will also be signing off that we all agreed upon when we first started this journey is a council so we want our city to be one that has a water supply that is pure want a city that enables active citizenship and connected communities we want one that maximizes opportunities to develop itself into a vibrant prosperous and sustainable 21st century city and we want one that takes leadership and the dressing climate change in take in making informed and proactive approaches to natural hazard risks and we want one that increases active public and shared transport opportunities and ante views safe and to be a place where our children are able to walk safely to school I canvassed some of my local young people and they the first thing that they want from us is to be able to walk bike and scooter to school safely so I 'm delighted that we have got this focus we 're bringing funds to improving our safety around our streets a local straight so that their parents can be confident that their children are able to travel to school using active transport in a safe way they won 't have to bring them to school in their cars which will mean less congested roads and alleviate the safety issues around schools is congestion is an ongoing them that we have heard their voices and we are listening to them and we are putting what we 're making this city what it should be for them I 'm confident that by adopting these recommendations we 're satisfying the needs for good economic outcomes for our city by providing jobs and we 're also funding the social housing to rebuild back to previous clip quake levels which means that we 're showing that we are a compassionate and caring City so I 'm delighted to be supporting these recommendations and I 'm confident that this LDB will position our city is one that we here 's a reputation for being a city of opportunity going forward thank you thank you David thank you firstly can I just acknowledge my colleagues and staff for the collaboration and work we 've done over the last nine months plus generally I 've been a very strong advocate of attending two core functions of the council roading three waters essential community services the Mears forward and mayor 's recommendations I 'm generally supportive of everything we have before us today and I South Shore and the sticks areas and we 'll be looking to positive and equitable actions following completion of the regeneration strategy and also rephrasing of the land drainage recovery program budget or thus the remedial actions I 've made some points where I 'm opposed to an aspect of the mayor 's recommendations roading and footpaths there are many in disparate needs across the city including in my area in the east one thing I 'm very keen to see happen and we did talk about it from the external advisory group there 's prioritizing of the remedial works of the worst roads in Christchurch and then attending to that I don 't see that happening in any great degree yet cycleways I 'm not against cycle waste per se but I am extremely concerned about some of the designs and options that we have enacted around the city and we 've divided communities over some of those although numerous submissions were received in favor of it many conversations that I have around town people express their concern and around the extent and number of cycle ways social housing not a core function for councilman and would ultimately like to see council housing totally separate from all council operations and independently operated the multi-purpose arena I 'm exceedingly and totally supported of advancing the funding in the LTP for this project and endorsed all the comments that Tim Scandrick made earlier in his presentation alternative funding I 'm I 'm all up for investigating alternative sources the fuel tax I 'm opposed to at this stage until we get some parity of of cost of fuel across the country and avoid this cellphone subsidization of fuel Headroom is a big concern for me and I know that you know we will sort of be around that 20 to 21 percent in a few years time and I really do consider it 's time to so there are options around seeking strategic partners and selling down some of our strategic assets it 's not selling assets its accessing funding from our assets and still retaining majority shareholding in control of these assets and finally I 'd just like to endorse I think everybody 's comments around the room that we of their waterway and get on with it I think Jamie said pretty much everything else I 'd like to say about that so thank you Thank You Jimmy King thank you Jericho I knew haseo konnichiwa a mistake buenas Dias a la una y ou problem Mulaney good Homolka salon Mabuhay the mayor my fellow councilors all the staff in our audience cumali if we reveal the council strategic framework consists of the vision of Kai Church community outcomes and the strategy are the priorities I think we all see and we all agreed we wonder is the city they can were safe clean green innovative sustainable inclusive and international unlatching the city solar long temper in 2008 18 to 28 will be the most important not only the strategic document but also a powerful tool to achieve the coming outcomes for the Easter City so I agree you know most of the amazed recommendation for instance I agree ensure our city belching water supply is safe secure and um pollinate and also I agree to maintain and renew the waste of water infrastructure I also agree to reduce a candle in relation to other health and even to our lives and also I agree to improve our role in the food has particular lost area in the poor condition condition also Alfre to support maintaining momentum in our city however I 'm disappointed in two kind of the facility first one I 'm disappointed the council reface the existing budget and push out two years of the new southwestern Asia center in a library and service center facility I consider very serious the timing of the funding for the southwest area new facility and also the library the home the area desperately we needed such a new facility and I 'm totally committed to delivery this as soon as possible so in a way that meets the needs of my community I consider moving in amendment to have the funding push out by one year only rather than the mayor 's the recommendation for two years however I decided not to as I 'd realized there is a significant body of work to be done with the community to find a site for the new facilities so I necessary once this work has been done so my key message to the people today is that I 'm totally committed to delivery the new facility for a people or wider homey zombie area and also for the people of a church as passed as quickly as possible and I will do everything I can to make sure we can on this require work quickly but generally speaking I fully support mr. long-term plan thank you very much ref mingy yeah thank you yeah me overall I think this has been a good process in terms of discussing what is you know still quite a complex financial situation for the council I 'm happy to support the mayor 's recommendations I think they do reflect the basics and they reflect resident surveys in terms of what the public expect us to be spending money on water supply every day people need water drinking water wastewater to flush away the waste footpaths to walk on and roads to travel on whether you 're on a car bike or a bus these are really the basics that everyone needs to access every that funding has come forward into those areas so that 's good I just want to raise three general issues which you know weren 't always covered in the plan but I think we need to keep an eye to one is the level of rates and you know the rates increases are very difficult for ratepayers and the debt Headroom has crept up from our last LTP where we did try to get to keep it at a 200% of net to revenue ratio and that is concerning I don 't think the demands on the city are going to lessen so I do think we need to think we 'll rethink and partial asset sales that will reduce debt I think there 's extra cash on our balance sheet that we could release that cash could be employed in extra investment I also think the idea of listing assets on the market actually it 's quite good for the city Wellington and Auckland both have their airports listed is actually great I mean we need some more focus on Christchurch we need to improve our brand as an some of the extra benefits of having some of your assets listed issues so I think we need to reconsider that I think also we need to present our financial information in a much more accessible way with the technology that we have today around online tools I think we need to get better at the way we present these reports the LTP is still very old school and we don 't get a lot of people engaging in it so I think one of the things we do need to work on is the way we present these budgets understand and then reflect their feedback I also think we need to take into account the impact of the potential global settlement with the crown it 's long overdue I think that we will finish it by the end of this year the use of the capital acceleration fund and streamlining the post-earthquake structures such as regenerate Christchurch and dzl which should yield some savings and lead to a more efficient and understandable system for the people so if I think we get those things done and we 'll be some of that stuff thank you Andrew thank you I 'd like to start by thanking staff for all the work that they 've done throughout the development of the plan I 'd like to thank the mayor for her leadership and I 'd also like to thank council colleagues for the collaborative approach that we 've taken to what at times have been quite difficult decisions and I actually think all of that has been reflected very well in the meeting that we 've had here this morning I like also the fact that we 've made changes to the plan as a result of the submissions that we 've received and submissions that we 've heard and also as a result of the results of the recent residents satisfaction survey and this is all led us to what really is more of a back-to-basics approach so I welcome the focus on roads and footpaths please that there 'll be an increased budget and a focus on banks peninsula roads as long as as well as there was in other areas including a working party of the banks peninsula and into the good practice of banks peninsula road repairs and upgrades I also welcome the focus on three waters I 'm pleased that will now not see any regression in the waste water Network we 've got work planned in the storm water network which is clearly aligned to the improvements that we need and want to make in those areas and funding for priority work to get the chlorine out of the water within the signal twelve months I 'm also pleased to see that there 's now funding on budget for delivery of a fit for purpose drinking water scheme for okay nice bang on banks peninsula to bringing forward of improvements to the diamond Harbor Wharf is a key investment in public transport infrastructure and I 'm also pleased to see that improvement work to the akaroa Wharf will continue pretty much immediately with design and consultation taking place over the next financial year I 'm also delighted that we 've got in this plan over ten million dollars for developments of the navel point area this has been a long awaited project which has got 'm pleased that listen will now allow for the boat safety improvements that have been needed for some time car parking interventions and the partnership opportunity with the navel point Club to be achieved and improvements to the sports facilities which have been affected by the risk from the nearby oil tanks I 'm also pleased to see the 30 million for social housing in the plan and welcomed the opportunity as we 've heard this morning to look in detail at options for increasing the level of service for social housing in the next few months so considering that we remain in a constrained and complex financial environment and with much work still to do and we 've got a coherent financial strategy that with careful consideration and discipline is not required the divestment of our asset holdings and in my view it doesn 't need to once borrowings high it remains within acceptable debt to revenue ratios which are forecast to come back to more normal levels over time much of what we 're building and spending has got intergenerational benefits and it 's entirely appropriate the costs strategy that sees improvements to networks over the life of this plan balancing that we 're taking into account community expectations around vertical infrastructure such as swimming pools and community centers and we 've achieved all of this within the previously signals rates rise of 5.5% with rates program to decrease overall too much reasonable levels during the life of this plan and it 's required discipline to remain within those increase envelopes and I hope the future councils will retain that discipline so that we can get rates increases back to reasonable levels as early as possible so overall I think this is a good plan that we 've put together and still quite a difficult situation and I 'm pleased to be able to support it today thank you all very much look can I just wrap up by saying again thank you to all of the staff involved it 's been an extraordinary effort to get to this point and I know that there 's still a little bit of work to be done but thank you very much for for all of that work it has the my colleagues around the table it 's you know sometimes it has to be a bit of give-and-take and everyone 's been prepared and willing to work collaboratively and to understand that you know not everyone agrees on the same set of priorities some of us have you know priorities in one area others have priorities in another area that it 's all valuable you know that 's how complex decisions are made and we 're in a complex environment we have challenging issues that we have to confront but you know my experience is that we all listen to each other and whether we agree or not we respect the fact that we have all been elected to represent the people of Christchurch and we 're here with the best interests of the city at heart so thank you to each and every one of you for the contribution that you have made I also want to thank the over 1,500 people and organizations who submitted on our long-term plan and just to also to make the point though that they weren 't the only ones who participated in shopping malls and various other places engaging with the public and not all of them would have tuned into submissions but there was that connection made and people understood that there was a process going on that they could participate and I know that a number also attended residents association meetings and business association meetings and winter board meetings and various other group meetings around the city and and just engaged on the on the content of the of the long term plan we also from a personal point of view I do very much hear concerns that have been expressed around the table around the level of debt I do worry about where the Headroom is heading and although we 've maintained you know sufficient to give us by the Prudential test I think where we are challenged to think about that a lot more carefully and I want us to think about that certainly as we go forward from here I 'm also concerned about rates and creases the the comparison that we make with other cities is always based on the average house price and so sort of saying I would pay a lot less than Oakland and my rates if I if I live there compared to Christchurch and I would like to take a picture of what a 500,000 investment in a house would by an Auckland and send it back and say but this is what you 'd be living in because the average the average house price is what the average rate represents and so and I kind of want to pick up on what one of the councillors said about you know the mechanism that rates represents and actually this is not a good way to to to provide or to fund services for a city of our size and scale to have it purely based on the capital value of property isn 't enough you know and we do have our our asset base from which we do Seve a rate of return but it is a mixed rate of return across their asset mix and and I think that we do need to we do need to think very seriously about that and how we resolve for some issues think you know to look to central government to partner and new ways of delivering services that are much more connected with communities central government local government partnerships are the way to go and I think that the government this government actually the previous government as well has established a core group within the Department of Internal Affairs which has the sole function of looking for that central government local government partnership and out of that in all of the funding reviews that are going on at the moment I hope that central government comes up with a better way of enabling us to fund core infrastructure at the same time as connecting with our communities because you know the the reestablishment of the full well-beings and legislation is very much a part of who we are as a city you know in terms of what we want to achieve I 'm going to be very focused on establishing the capital infrastructure the capital program sort of Oversight Committee or whatever it 's going to be called I can 't think what a what a dreadful acronym that might make it will be a committee of the whole Council and I think will enable us to ensure that we are monitoring progress in a way that doesn 't well on a no surprises basis is probably the best way for me to me to describe there so again thank you all very much you know these these these debates actually I 've really enjoyed the debate I 've really enjoyed listening to well everyone has had to say so on that note I shall put the motion but I thought we did no do we have to can I put the vote and then come out of standing orders yeah okay so I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you and so we 've got a couple more resolutions to go they were past all of those and so now doing this in the right order that the council reinstates the Standing Orders suspended earlier in the meeting I 'll move that seeking to by Mike I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those resolution which is that and we took out the infrastructure strategy didn 't_''_8839.86 we so that the council adopts the summary of the rates impact and net debt ratio impact adopts the changes to the council 's capital program D the if H and L all right yes okay so it was updated attachment see so so that 's been moved by me and seconded by you Andrew yep so I 'll put that motion glitches in regards to the development contributions policy I don 't see any specific reference to us adopting it today in the last LTP we did adopt development contribution policy and I 'm just wondering if I 've so we normally I it was my understanding that we would normally adopt a development contribution policy that 's it so we can do that any time okay so just in terms of recording but some of these resolutions those things that obviously we 've already done there we 've done it for your recommendation yes we haven 't done it for the cathedral rate is the secret that 's we haven 't done that yet we not doing that till Tuesday yes so you 're moving wait one minute process it subsequently changed and consulted on after the LTP process because it 's um it relies on the capital program which is only finished at the very last point so the it 's currently of change so if we were to adopt it would be adopting it as it is currently sitting and thanks for clarifying yeah so I just wanted my vote recorded then against the capital program so you want to vote against adopting the proposed changes to the council 's capital program set as an attachment D so that 's all right right so I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you and we 've got no no no that it goes let 's cross that out delete and this is where we stop I think I think we 've done we 've done this all that we need to do now so I 'll just okay sorry we 've done that so so so now we have adopted the recommendations and we are now going to simplify the final version of the infrastructure strategy which I 'm really grateful to staff for putting on the effort to do this I think it will really help make it more accessible and a good starting point for the next one and and and then we 'll formally adopt the long term plan on Tuesday so we 're almost there and neurology in the meeting until 30 Tuesday morning thank you very much thank you you _"

    "text": "and the next item on the agenda is the moving of the recommendations that are set out in my name but before I do that could I invite the chief executive to speak to the matters that have been identified in a number of the submissions and are being progressed by staffers operational matters and then I will be asking you to note these in accordance with our consideration of the recommendation so I 'll hand over to cut any words thank you thank you Mir just congratulations and getting to this point I know it 's been a significant amount of work both for counselors and staff for the last nine months and and particularly tricky in terms of challenge and challenging in terms of balancing out all the issues that youth that you need to look at over that time so we had more than 1,500 submissions and as you know who 'd 300 organizations and groups over time over the course of that not only did people talk about some of the issues and the content of the draft long term plan but also raised a number the basics right so we 've put together a summary of some of the things that people talked about in terms of things that we can just get on and do and so I 've listed for you in this memorandum that I 've tabled and it 's also on your advice in the big ten can there may be other things that we 've missed but generally I think it 's a good summary of the things that people are talking about about the way that we work and the things that we need to do with our community so that 's just to give you some reassurance that we 've heard from those submitters and already working on some of those those issues and we 'll come back to you with clarity around some of those and the recommendations from your deliberations over the next few days with any other work that the organization will just get on and do thank you very much look I 'll just just before I move the mayor 's recommendations I just want to just talk just a little bit about process then what will happen on Tuesday so the [Music] technically from you know technical point of view the recommendations for amending the the LTP are encaptured and Aamir 's recommendations so some of them sort of looked like that they 're you know sort of relatively technical and they are so it 's not so so much it 's more of a technical process to have them all on block and with ananias recommendations there are elements within within the recommend well that haven 't been captured and the recommendations that individual councillors would like to test the meeting over so these and and these are amendments to the recommendations so we 'll be accepting amendments to the recommendations at this council meeting today and we will be voting on those today as well there are within the block of recommendations and within the LTP itself there are elements that individual councillors would like to record their opposition to they 're not opposing the entire adoption of the LTP and they 're not opposing the entire block of recommendations and so we 're going to come up with a resolution particular matters you know it might be elements of the Northern Corridor there might be elements of particular projects whatever and that 's perfectly in order so we 're finding a mechanism and the sort of kind of block voting arrangement for individual counselors to express their opposition to elements of it nobody 's going to agree to absolutely everything on an occasion like this so we 're looking at a mechanism to easily record how that might be best recorded for that for for posterity I tend not to do that myself because as the mayor I have to speak for the decision of the council regardless of whether I personally agree with the approach that 's been adopted or not and then be and then so and we will debate those amendments we 'll debate my recommendations and then going well today we will we will get to the point of adopting all of those coming back resuming Standing Orders and then formally adopting the mayor 's recommendations as a mentor by the meeting and noting the matters to be progressed by staff and the chief executives memorandum may be issues that we want to record in terms of the operational work that the staff are doing as well and then the last thing that we will do is adopt the information and documents set out and attachments C to H and L of the staff report so the one reports that we 're going to hold on to as the infrastructure strategy and we 're just doing some tidy-up of the wording of elements of the infrastructure strategy that will then go to the audit office they will have that on for Monday and we will adjourn the meeting essentially till Tuesday morning and when we come back on Tuesday morning we will have the Audit Office sign-off that we require to proceed and then we will receive the order Court and adopt the long-term plan and that is when we will all make our major contributions to the overarching long term plan so there 'll be if I was still in Parliament it would be the general debate really actually it would be the debate on the budget so the budget debate is a significant debate 'll get your three minutes to express your views about that and I think the process this time has been I mean it 's been challenging but it has been a lot better than it was the first time there are a couple of things that we 've had this time that we didn 't have last time and the first one is that we 've actually settled our insurance for a global settlement we didn 't know what that was going to be and we really didn 't have any sort of overarching concept about finances so I 'd like to thank staff for the incredible effort that they 've put on I know that worked night and day I know that worked weekends and it has been an extraordinary effort on their part to get to this point so just just with those so so so we 'll be a tuning today once we 've dealt with the amendments and we 'll be coming back adopting our infrastructure strategy and then completing that final stage of adopting the long-term plans so right so on that note I will being progressed by staff and seconded by Andrew tuna and I will open it up for for amendments and yep so amendments first Sarah good I have a seconder for that Dion so I just take it by okay all right so is there is there any discussion though Yanni Andrews staff in a position to answer questions on it means what the questions are yes okay so Yanni so much my question really is and and like if it doesn 't alter the program and and we know we 're going to get further funding from national entrance for anyway so that 's a backup you know I 'm supportive of giving the cycleways up I just want to make sure but in fact putting other cycleways forward isn 't going to put other ones back which we hear especially if we 've already had interim agreement on those you only did you have a question okay more debate okay the rates in pet I 'm gonna I 'd assumed that there wasn 't a rates impact because it was bringing forward okay 2025 2026 and 2027 that in resolve things in the next year okay and on the national transport program we would look it and through the additional funding that we anticipate providing the connection from the northern parallel and we can start immediately so it would be dependent on wrong wrong cycle way way just bring forward one year to another because we 're not planning on doing anything to do it we 're just bringing it forward without any proposal to defer anything else okay so um Tim so I guess my concern is when you come back to us with the impact on rates that would be my only Christian that 's see that there 's an EM page but it 's 25 26 and 27 so I mean we 've got time to resolve that next year and the but annual plan but if any increase that comes then I fixed something else yes so without a debate and discussion about what else that could other things could be we 're still adding things onto so I mean that 's we 've had a hot a lot of time to discuss all of going to add something something falls off yeah I can 't agree to adding something not knowing what it is it 's going to come off okay I mean that 's the debate so yep yep so the rate so the increase is actually yeah no no I mean it 's that that 's the debate and and and we can I mean we heard a lot of submissions on this one on the port Hills Road and the dangers on that road so you know I 'm I 'm over mind just to support this one so do there is debate on it Jonnie yeah I mean I 'm strongly in support of person fat I 'd actually like to see this one done so sooner than that but I appreciate that we do have budget pressures this is one of the most sensible locations for a cycle way in the entire city we 've tragically had a death along that state highway 74 I think it was a pedestrian there are numerous concerns with the industrial traffic that go through this area we 're actually building a cycle with almost nowhere to go in fact I 'll be going contrary to the traffic that 's currently coming one way into the past the ternary and Garland 's right so you know this makes a lot of sense to do the circle way it will both be popular I think for commuting and also for recreation and I think that 's the key thing that we heard a lot of submissions about people feeling safe and having off road separated cycle ways I think is definitely the way forward it is there is an irony about this route and and that is that when the development was approved for the Kino a farm site there was a requirement to provide cycling and pedestrian access along the same river corridor unfortunately a few years ago there was a variation to the consent and Council agreed to allow some yellow lines painted on the road to stop parking and a little bit of undergrounding paid for by the developers and they got away from having to provide that public amenity for the cycle and the pedestrian but this just makes a contentious cycleways that we will ever do in the city because it 's mainly off-road and it serves a very strong cycling community and recreational route so in Andrew I 'd really like to support those I have to say but there is a rate some Pete and I think kind of like okay extra cycle additional cycle ways coming in at the last minute isn 't really going to help a whole program I think we need to take the public with us we hit a lot of deputations both ways on the cycle ways I 'd love it to go ahead and in time it will surely the answer is that when the National Land Transport program comes to us that we make sure that these much-needed cycle ways really go into that plan and I have every confidence they would but I think that would be a better process than deciding on one or two today that the content as do earlier on the Northern Line that makes total sense and I 'm sure I will support that when it when that amendment comes like I cannot on rates and I can not agree with it we 're dealing with an amendment at this late stage we 've had some good answers from staff on the rates impact which is minimal and is in the plan obviously we can deal with that impact if it requires smoothing in future and your plan or long-term plan processes and it is a very small impact we 've also heard as a result of questions to staff that it doesn 't involve pushing out any other cycleway or further deferral or abandoning any other project so on balance and I mean the Port Hills Road is a road that I drive every day and with the recent posting of the new 60 kilometre speed limit it is a dangerous road I 've never cycled down that road and I don 't think I would want to cycle down that road I can see that the impact of the cycle way for those that do and we heard from a number of people in the heath cook community in particular who will use that cycle way I could see that the impact on rates and the fact that it 's further out in the the annual in the long term plan years and given the fact that it 's not impacting on any other delivery of the cycle waste program on balance I 'm supportive of this one turn in Mike thank you I think this is actually a priority of raising the speed limit on this ride is ridiculous from since a 50k to 60k if you look see the city to surf there 's an absolute nightmare and my communities actually affected a lot more than many others with regards to the rep running dodging the road of a million sets of lights you think gem streets beard what about brown street so my community is the trucks jumpin on Kashmir Road are some tourists rode on to Port Hills Road so I know this well and my communities told me and tells me continually that this is a problem which it is so I but we 've also got a document here that we 've put out to the public we 've started rates at five point five nine percent so I would agree to looking at Barratt prioritizing our cycleways and the regards not with rates but with safety needs and this would be a party but I can 't agree to this with any adjustment right over the next ten years because we have heard from our ratepayers and it 's the ones that are sucked they have locked and incomes the elderly or those on some kind of benefits etc with their own homes they are struggling with 5.5% so with the promise that we have given to go from 5.5 percent over the next 10 years to 2.9 I 'm sorry I would agree to an adjustment with our priorities without any effect on rates in this so I can at the stage support us Mike then Glen thank you I 'll be supporting this amendment hit Expressway was you know it 's been consulted with the community we 've obviously go into the tenor at the moment but the last section has been delayed this is a section in a community that he wants the cycleway we 've heard him so many people roads are around here and the need for this safe way a lot of written submissions talked about this cycle where it 's actually really important that we move forward on this sooner rather than later and like Yoanna also ii would like to see it a little bit more forward but we are standing above the amount of rates we have in the first few years but any opportunity to bring this cycle way forward i think we need to to leap at it is important we 've got a lot of people now one into cycle a lot of children actually want to cycle but you know in christchurch we have double the average national rate of cycle incidents and we can improve that for for schoolchildren we need need to do it so this is something i support and clean thank you i 'm confused on this in the preamble to the LTP it says we will also consider prioritizing other cycle ways including Green spine which I 've put up and our workshops of the article I live in River corridor once the National Land Transport precedent whereby we could promote others I mean I would have liked to promote it because we still have to wait for well this is the debate yep under debate environment yeah so so I 'll just say a couple words and then go to Sara to wrap up but I understand what people are saying about it that the reality is is that we know that most more funding is coming I think they 're having heard the submissions you can 't argue against this one because of the dangers of the port Hills Road so so I 'm going to support it but I 'm going to say to staff that we 've got to find a way of making sure that we get rid of that rates impact I 'm confident that we will because I know that the fundings coming and that 's the difficulty with us during our LTP now and the funding coming a little bit later so I 'm very supportive of it Sara was due to be finished this year it was the original plan it was gonna be finished in 2018 've really wanted one and this one does follow a rail corridor which does make it much easier much less contentious it also serves not just Heathkit but the the tourists coming to the gondola to fira meet here at each Park and there 's a significant number of cyclists in Littleton who busts through the tunnel and hop off hop off the bus and hop on their bikes again and he 's getting we heard from some of him as well that they would like this bought through and I think it 's some stage finding a way for the Littleton residents to bite through the tunnel would be amazing but if we don 't bring this funding forward we not only continue to update this community and put them in danger but we have a hole in our funding in in a couple of years for the major cycleways programs so we 've brought through a couple in the maze recommendations already which is fantastic and brought them right up the front and what sets means there 's a hole in the funding which means that we wouldn funding in those years if we didn 't have enough of our own funding on budget to do that and so having this funding brought forward closes that hole in the actual prioritization of which cycleways get brought forward when we know the NZTA funding funding assistance rates will be done later this year when we know what those funding assistance rates are it is it 's a pain that we don 't know those now we can 't budge it for them we know they 're coming but but we need to do this and I 'd like to see this cycle way for much further and I 'm sure they later this year will be able to have a look at that as well thanks alright I 've put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no can you put up your hands for No East Galloway Gulf Clearwater Skindred so that 's carried thank you and we might as well deal my Davidson with your amendment it 's good yep what you 're happy to seek and their poor name is there in say aye there 's a person no it 's Kerry thank you thank you right Sarah in the in the governance and decision-making process a section of the music community shion 's where it talks about the the new reports in having some clarity on a reports I 'd like to change the wording where it currently says we 're relevant address opportunities to demonstrate climate change leadership and I 'd like to change that to address the impacts of decisions on our climate change commitments knowledge that many of the things we do have an impact on our climate change commitments and sometimes those are positive and sometimes they 're not so and I think that acknowledging both of those is really important not just the positive ones yep seconded by Vicky I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed then no that 's carried thank you who else had an amendment Aaron I 've just passed my knack for typing oh well we 'll wait till it 's tight then it 's pretty short it 's very simple I had a noting provision yeah yeah if it is it to go into is that to go into Koreans report or is it yes is that what we went over the carbon sinks okay so just just move it as and I 'm is a noting provision okay just this noting provision we can happen at the end that the council explore with the government opportunities for carbon sequestration by way of tree planting including but not limited to the green spine and there is any to rezone the banks peninsula the walls Lee 's Craig Croft area and other suitable areas in the Kaju City District there 's already planting going in some places but it 's the intentionality of that I think it would be good Kevon sequestration forestry did you want to be part of the emissions trading scheme as well so what you saying gives you some additional money if you can it might be a we and we can do it anyway also just want to do a no Tim provision under hogs Protoss in parks that staff report back to Council by December 2019 on the playground and facilities in the popular reward those opposed say no that 's carried thank you any other amendments it was yummy so just trying to get some information from staff over Heath get in Oak Street streets are in bad shape and the skirt repairs unfortunately didn 't well they can 't they can 't drain basically and I would have thought they were a renewal priority staff have just advised that they 're not on the renewal list which was different to my understanding but regardless we 're currently consulting on the walton village master plan so I want noting that the council is currently consulting on the Woolston village master plan that we are one project and that depending on the outcome of that consultation that consideration is giving to aligning the Heath Kurt and Oak Street projects for cost efficiency and synergy by bringing forward the budget so we 've got huge amount of work happening along on both sides of those two streets along Ferry Road and along the river where we 're doing the dredging and there will be significant impact and previously the council resolved and bring forward the WL projects to get synergy but we 're in the middle of consulting and so I don 't want to predetermine the outcome and I appreciate that we 've got budget issues it just would be really good to have a process by which we could actually effort made sense because it was more cost effective and we had the synergy that we could do that work together so yeah no I think that makes good sense does anyone want to second that that motion Andrew any discussion I 'll put that motion Oh that 's it if if there are synergies yeah it doesn 't actually require the work to be done is a report will come once the consultations done on the Williston did you write so yes at the moment we 're in the middle of consultation on wl1 the council 's previously resolved to enable the community board to request the bringing forward of the WL projects if it makes sense part of the issues that have been raised through the consultation is lack of parking and removal parking there 's been 's yellow lines and so yeah so it 's basically just to enable council to consider would still have to come in front of council but we we would have to decide to actually proceed to do that so that gives us an able it enables us to consider it in the context of the next annual plan and you 'd probably save yeah or the budget because you 'd have the same overhead rather than having two different procurement or three different procurements I think you know this but this aligns with my amendment our recommendation and getting back to getting the basics right that the very first the very sorry I haven 't updated copy the the very first recommendation under getting the basics writers that the council requests that when delivery of capital projects has been scheduled that consideration has given two opportunities to achieve synergies with related projects and the same or nearby vicinity in order to deliver greater cost effectiveness and timely delivery across projects and this one 's as in the process of being consulted on so I think actually calling it out as not a an actual commitment to the project right now it shouldn 't have a rate some pitch yes thank you so I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried Thank You Unni do you want John to sorry AB lot Street is anyone else got do anyone else have any minutes sorry it 's commitments on that chart climate change one the word was commitments because we the impacts about decisions aren 't on our policies right I 'll make sure that 's changed yeah okay thanks cool right Aaron you 've got yours now have you yes so under page eight bullet point five point three so it 's just sticking with the Emir 's kind recommendation that was a Revere and just changing one word which was in your recommendation head the with option two options including traffic lights is one of those options some I I don 't know whether staff want to comment on that or not I 'm I 'm over mind to think that that 's that that 's fair enough it 's right okay so what well I 'm perfectly happy to adopt it as part of that we don 't need to move it as an amendment I 'm perfectly happy to accept it as part of the recommendation yep thank you very much made of me thank you very much councillor Curie nice doing business with you okay so yah Nia we got our we back to you now sorry I haven 't got all of yours proposals in front of me Jonnie I 'm I would rule some of these out of order so so I just and some of the some of them I mean the asking you were both being recorded that we 're dealing with there and a process right so the the one on unallocated DC 's for Central City rebate being put towards the repair rebuilding of council social housing units I wouldn 't accept as a an amendment on the basis that we would need staff advice we would need information in front of us in order to make a decision on us so I don 't believe that we could make an tables of the unallocated amount there it 's also shown that there 's been very limited uptake I 've had email saying that we 're carrying forward thirteen million dollars I think on these DC rebates so I just would like some opportunity to definitely vote against the unallocated amount continuing and actually up towards something else in the budget or just take it off all together but I don 't know what the best way to do that is there has been lots of advice we 've had submissions and support of rebuilding a social housing I think your God I listened to this way of dealing with that if you just want to invite record it against it is that the best thing today both recorded against development contributions policy that 's what the counselor wants to do it 's possible for you to entertain an amendment at this stage on that issue if the counselor wants to vote against it he can but but what 's the I mean I I 'm just trying to understand the framing of it won 't sit in the LTP it date and it just doesn 't something we borrow it 's a policy question so so originally we 've had the presentation from regenerate Christchurch and they were gonna report back on the incentives blueprint central city plan and part of this was developed through that idea and when we last heard from regenerate it was expected that we would be briefed prior to finalizing the LTP so that some of these things we you know we could have a bit more evidence place we had a discussion about this at the development forum yesterday so I just think that I understand what you 're trying to do but we don 't have the advice in front of us is there a process that we can get where we can actually make a decision based on what such how this thing is being used the region are reviewing the central city plan and actually you seem to have in your head that development contributions that for gone so would have been paid other than for the rebate is somehow money sitting on budget it isn 't and I don 't but isn 't money that exists I mean maybe DC 's 101 from the end of the table because I don 't know how many times it needs to be explained before somebody can understand it could could somebody I don 't know now this time to rebate 101 session as well it 's been explained to the council 's of more times than I can count and I just don 't think now is even an appropriate time to do it anyway I wonder if we bring back the DC policy to council and have a workshop on it and in some discussion around it it 's a good idea so so I 'm not I 'm not accepting that one playground which I sent through last night I 've been trying to get information since Monday so apologies for the late notice it 's a local it 's a small local project with a relatively small budget but it is quite frustrating that the projects being delayed and there doesn 't seem to be any ability to have a consideration of how it gets funded so I 've we just can we pop that into the enter the chief executives list as well because we know that the money has been allocated to Thompson Park here but generally speaking to we were told quite unequivocally that if you want to substitute something it has to be in your own ward so here we have a counselor that 's trying to take man of an adjoining world to fund something in his ward so as far as Glenn and I are concerned we weren 't very comfortable with the Horseshoe Lake and Thompson Park situation and effectively in spend a bit of extra money for some planting so I think the council should be looking for money from its own approach this is one of the synergy projects that there is there is work being done there and it 's the question is why can 't the whole lot work be done as well and that 's why I 'm just going to say that can I just take a take bit into the chief executives one and that they will do some work on on how they could issues in order to to get that whole project done so just put it down just to be clear because I am a little bit concerned that the two counters somehow think that I 'm taking money off Thompson Park or course she liked her she like was deferred to enable Thompson Park to go ahead in Thompson Park is about half the cost of Horseshoe Lake so basically there 's an interest component that 's saved by not doing Horseshoe Lake which is not something that I 've put forward that 's the advice that staff have given that it won 't be ready to be done until a certain time so there 's an actually an interest saving in that so there was no desire to delay the what we like or reduce the Thompson Park look I understand what you 're trying to do but let 's leave it to the chief executive from an operational point of view to find a way of achieving that consistency thing too it took us by surprise so we didn 't see it coming yeah it was yes I was no no no I think I think we 're there I think we 've got all of the amendments on the table so the northern arterial extension is currently under construction the issue now is the downstream effects everything else is as unprocessed so we can 't vote against there it 's only being constructed downstream effects I think that 's what counselor Henson 's talking about and this from an asteroid Seth got 10 million dollars on budget for there yeah I 'm just sorry they 're not they 're not amendments are sorry I already said that we 've got a process for dealing with it can we just take number four hours it wasn 't sorry I had you I hadn 't noticed that had gone up sorry that so so you want you want to proceed with the Linwood Paul resolution no no you can 't ask until I 've got a mover in a second so it 's been moved by Jonnie and seconded by Sarah so so that that 's the that 's the resolution so I 'm sure their counsel your hints and chair of the infrastructure transport Environment Committee improvement yes very improvement in my view signifies quite a negative outcome I think actually enhanced value by seeking partnerships which has certainly been a focus of the submissions as a bit of way of saying saying it so you know I think very improvements should be something we do across all of our projects it shouldn 't be just specified to one particular project and you know I think that 's the idea for this Linwood one is that we do want to work collaboratively with the community with people that have expressed an interest and look at enhance value but I am concerned that the words very improvement have a different connotation and that 's why I 've suggested in the memo does anyone want to speak to this resolution Pauline the value improvement is actually should also be across all their projects because it 's about delivering the same outcome that 'll be more efficient and cost effective manner want to move that we do that across all the projects and I know we 're in debate and I 'm else want to say anything Sara you know the words technically mean kind of the same thing it 's just the implications a different one seems a little punitive in the other one sees hey let 's do what 's best and I think that we should go for the let 's do what 's best option well I 'm gonna vote against this amendment and the reason is is that we sit around this table representing the city not individual war it 's not individual projects we represent the city and if we don 't expect value improvement from all of our projects then I just think that we 're not doing our job as councillors I think that the city of Christchurch expects us to get good value for the money that we expend we are looking at partnerships that 's actually called out in the in the proposal for partnerships with other organizations that may seek to co-locate or co-organized their arrangements you know when you look at the opportunities for clubs to co-locate with a with a council swimming pool I mean what a fantastic opportunity area the amenity will be lifted immeasurably but we have to look at more cost-effective ways of delivering things and there is not a negative it 's actually a positive it 's not a cost to the community it 's an investment in the community so I would like the words value improvement to remain there because enhanced value might might actually mean the complete opposite which is not looking for those opportunities to save money for the wider community of Christchurch so that 's why I 'm voting against I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed who know it 's lost thank you the levels of service for social housing can we leave that tool after we do the levels of service and the next iteration we 've asked Carlene and thus recommendation to come back I think by August September proposals here yeah no we we would we couldn 't do this based on the advice that we have at the moment this is significant yeah this is this is a significant change we couldn 't do it off the back of service for social housing by 500 over the next 10 years based on this no we can 't change that people 's the sense they drive the organization so we can certainly we could certainly note that we have an aspiration to increase the levels of social housing in the city over the next 10 years and to look for partnership opportunities to achieve that but we 're not going to change our levels of service based on us so you can leave it at that all right so I think we 're done on the amendments good right look thank you all very much and and now we 'll debate the recommendations as as amended and and I 'll just kick that off briefly when I commented before the introduction to this discussion today and talking about process I actually referred back to the last long-term plan and when I introduced the city 's first post-earthquake long-term plan and it was the very first long-term plan that the council conducted after the earthquakes you might remember that just in 2013 it was a three-year plan that was adopted not very good reason the same things happened in Kokoda and her own oath I 've been that they 've been laid off their obligations to do the full long term plan process because of the situation that they found themselves in but that means that the council was facing significant financial uncertainties and as I said before since then we 've negotiated a global settlement of our insurance claim and we have a much better understanding of our financial situation but also the true state of our horizontal infrastructure and I think for me it has been of real concern and it has been all around this table I know that every single one of you have expressed this concern that the scoot program did not repair as much of our pipes and roads as the council had been expecting so when the previous council went into the long term plan and sorry went into the cost-sharing agreement with central government they basically we 're confident that what they were signing up to was an agreement to fix everything that was broken and to share the costs of that on 40 split on the horizontal infrastructure excluding roads it was basically an 20 split on the roads it didn 't cover footpaths unfortunately but it was a significant contribution to the to that to the cost and and what we got back after the skirt program was come Peters was far less than the repair of everything and that 's because the cost-sharing agreement was written in a way that really hadn 't been properly interpreted by the previous council and that was it was only the essential network restoration that was covered by the 6040 and the 20 split and that has caused this council to reflect on the true state of its assets and how we 're going to take things forward from here and I guess that when we 've listened to the submissions we have heard over and over and over again get back to basics get the basics done get the basics right the basics was mentioned over and over and over again it 's about pipes it 's about roads it 's about footpaths the other priority for the city right now we 've got to get things right they also said to us because we did some trade-offs and said have we got the balance right and actually the people crush it said not there 's there 's an element that you haven 't got right and that is as you 're prepared to compromise the wastewater we don 't want you to compromise the wastewater and so we 've addressed that as well so we 've put money on budget for the wastewater we 've put more money on budget for the for the roading and the footpaths and we 've really tried to focus on getting those basics right the the message also came through loud and clear about what we what we value in terms of our identity as a city and on that note I just want to mention chlorine so when we when we started off down this process we we didn 't know what we didn 't know the plan was pretty much locked down at the time that we had to make the decision to temporarily chlorinate our water our our residents have come back to that chlorine out of the water and we remain committed to doing that and we that does mean that we have to increase our budget we brought forward the budget significantly in order to be able to achieve that another message that came through loud and clear was that Christchurch needs a foot for purpose stadium that can attract major sporting events and and and the timers right to make that a priority the government has signaled with the capital acceleration fund that they 've got money that they can bring to the table I don 't think the public of Christchurch were actually aware that the cost-sharing agreement had no financial contribution to the stadium from the government guaranteed other than the land and and so now that we know that they have money available to support us we can bring the stadium forward and our budget it 's it 's still not as far forward in our budget as it would have been if the original cost-sharing agreement had been adhered to but we had to push it out when we didn 't know what we didn 't central government to come in with with the first tranche of the funding that 's required we are going to require others to join us and partnering to fund the stadium because our contribution is kept at 253 million and I 'm certainly very interested in looking for options that reduce our contribution as well so it 's it hasn 't been an entirely easy process has been easier than the last process in some ways and harder than the last process and others still don 't think we 've got the engagement with our community right the the hearing of submissions process although they 're you know it 's an important part of the democratic process I think we do need to find ways of reaching out being where people are at the supermarket set the the various cultural activities and festivals and things all year round perhaps were the presence that actually engages people and all of the issues that the council 's involved in so thank you very much for all of the hard work that I know that all of you have done and and I the table so I 'll start off with you Vicki no no oh these are the amendments yeah the recommendations in the amendments sorry it 's about mostly the whole thing we 've got to I think there 's been huge work that 's gone into it and I think seven years out from a disaster we 've learned that the scale of damage was as you say much much higher than the things I don 't think we would have got through this earthquake in Christchurch City good balance sheet heat of the disaster and it 's ownership of assets because if we look at what CC HL has been able to provide it 's been amazing I agree completely that the chlorine has to be taken out and that 's it 's great that the money has been brought forward I love the fact that we 've put in a loan for social housing so that it 's rich neutral but it means that that we are still continuing to build social housing I think that 's really really important if you look at the fact that the and increase over the next I love the fact that we 've got the shared equity fund and therefore to help people buy their first house and and the airing fee has gone out to providers for this this week educational training and I really like that we 've got the green prescription continuing and that we 've helped it embarrasses recycling remains a huge problem for every council in New Zealand and probably many around the world in terms of how we recycle recyclables given that China has closes its doors and that the market has been flooded we have a big challenge ahead of us in that I like the fact that we 've maintained the momentum and this and this long-term plan I think it 's really important that we maintain a sense of hope and confidence and optimism and the whole thing about anything as possible and that there this is a city of opportunity I think there are things that we would love to have addressed I would love to have addressed water bottling and the fact that it should not be allowed to be be taken and should not be allowed to be put into bottles of plastic which may be manufactured on-site those things give me the heebie-jeebies and just not part of what we want for the city but in terms of have we looked at the basics addressed those addressed the key issues and tried to move the city forward in a way that is about Christchurch and the inclusiveness that is Christchurch and the social equality that we want to provide and the social inclusiveness that we want to provide to make this a great place for everybody who lives here to to live here so I think it 's actually really good perfect timing yonni weakly you want to sweeter the whole thing or just the amendments today it 's the mayor 's recommendations as amended there 's gonna be Jim generally when we come back we 'll probably debate the same things but you know I mean it 's the Me 's recommendations as amended you know the what 's come through really clearly is I still think we 're a city divided there 's there 's a it pretty good and see the opportunity and love the kind of glitz and the glamour of what 's ahead and then there 's a side of the city that 's still struggling with the impact of the earthquakes all these years old part of the problem as I see it has been that the original financial strategy of council was to while the repairs were being done was to do renewals at the same time rather than duplicate projects unfortunately that hasn 't happened in fact the opposite has happened and the worst worse has happened and that there appears that we got have meant that some streets can 't drain properly that they 're deteriorating quicker than they would have otherwise and so a lot of the money that 's been spent from skirt program has actually left things in a much worse condition than was anticipated which means we 've got a huge cost going forward they still I think a huge challenge in the city between looking after the basic needs of people like housing community funding in local facilities versus the Central City and the stadium so III really think I commend them for coming up with a number of recommendations to try and address getting synergy you know often we 're told that things are going to cost more and the idea that we should only value improve one project I think is a little bit sad in fact we should be looking at a number of opportunities to save money and reduce costs and I think there 's a there 's ways in which we can do that and I 've seen my colleagues two examples last night but I could just many more I think one of the concerns I have is we 're not finishing existing cycle ways and we 're starting new ones and I really kind of struggle with that I would have thought it was sensible to build get a cycle way complete and its total if you want to see the impact but we 're not we 're not doing that which is so fun I just want to address the issues in the mod because I do think that you know I am said that we done that for any of the others and I think it sends quite a negative connotation this is a community that just recently had a Salvation Army report saying that it felt forgotten and that its voices weren 't being heard through this process we 've had a number of submissions and support and welcoming the the Lord Wolfson poll and yet we 've come up what I believe is quite a negative amendment it 's a community that said it 's bus services just cut yesterday by ikan and some parts and it 's a community that 's struggling to get the basic specs post-earthquake so yeah I was really said that we 've passed that amendment I don 't think think it sends a good signal that they should have to do with lease when others are getting more but that 's my time up so thank you for the work that 's been done on this I still have concerns with the quantum of funding and the prioritization of where it 's going thank you Tim thank you and this has been a long journey it seems 'm sure Mike inspect for my colleagues to kallen your staff they 've done an amazing metalwork this has been a very hard juggle and conditions in the city that we are in but and we all love our city and we want it to move forward so that 's really the priority so I think that this our long-term plan has really achieved a lot of things you know people already talked about the concern oh the debt Headroom the the cost-sharing that the gaps editors have left and the true cost of that but we have to move forward and one of those things and Leanne pointed it out with regards to we are councillors elected an award but the ward that we represent as a Christ Church anchor or all the wards of Christchurch and part of that is to make sure that there is economic benefit positive economic benefit to this city so I am absolutely really chuffed that we are moving forward there multi-use arena to 2020 124 I think that 's outstanding and I really look forward to working with the Minister for Christchurch savings we can for the best value that we can get there is a concern there though that we do not lose the vision of what that is all about about putting the economic benefit into the central city and other places in Christchurch so those private partnerships that we look at we must be really careful about what they want and we 've got to keep our focus on what 's best for Christchurch Bank secondly with regards to what we heard from our communities about road safety and it 's great to have it in the ER that the council gives high and immediate priorities for increased road maintenance and Road Safety specify zng intersections and around schools and that is absolutely crucial to our and all our immediate communities and it 's great to see the additional capital spinach starting 428 2018 19 increasing by 5.1 million and increasing from that over the next few years so I think that is essential and I look forward to working with staff about how we achieve that in our communities and all our communities the final things thing I council I talked about the elected members not the council staff we 've put in this long term plan the schedule of arm rates increases starting at 5.5 and decreasing in the next five years to five percent and the final five years of this long-term plan from 4% to 2.9 percent we just had a discussion earlier on about putting in something that may well affect rates increases further down the trick but those people in our city that are on fixed incomes need to be able to have faith in this council that they can plan and adjust for the future and if we 're going to just throw things and without taking things out I 'm sorry I just cannot stand there we 've got to give really good firm ground to those on fixed benefits in fixed income so I really think we 've achieved this and in 10 years going down to 2.9 achieving everything that we have set out to do looking forward and positively to the future for all our communities I think that 's gonna be um I think we 've achieved in my colleagues thanks Tim I clean okay thank you preparation for this I had a quick look at International also national surveys on the issues that matter the most for New Zealanders they included economic issues housing homelessness second social issues and via mental issues a cetera and that 's from a Roy Morgan poll the latest that I could find I surveyed my own household and the youngest they said save the environment once it vegetarian butchers he also said it makes a hyper slide it can we free because you 're the counselor they go to a place called unlimited when I surveyed the older ones in the home they talked about getting rid of the chlorine in the waterr fixing the roads but also having a stadium and I think that last but actually sums up where many in the city are it 's not necessarily as straight out kind of dichotomy between one or the other we live in a strange tension of needs we do have to attend to the most basic and I can definitely say in my part of the world that you can 't get away from that as is putting back community facilities so that people have a place to go in the long journey to recovery my sense is that this tension of needs will remain in our city for some time and that it won 't be easily resolved and that of course we feel it is the local decision-makers and but that at some point we just have to push the Go button and make hard decisions decisions which will also be at times unpopular just quickly looking at a couple of other issues the red zone presents for us an amazing opportunity to do something different just a bit of training recently took me out to bottle Lake and even in deplorable weather people love nothing more than just giving in to the outdoors walking their dogs running cycling whatever and I think in the red zone if we can provide a great amenity there for people to enjoy that will be part of their recovery as well it can also be a carbon sink and part of us leading the way as a city in when you provide for it it 's a bit like spark plugs in a car it goes well you take one of the spark plugs out it starts to chug and for the bus housing is a system you need every part in the system functioning well or it falls to bits as we can see with the I think it 's 23,000 homeless on the streets of Auckland so we 're in the hundreds as far as I 'm aware but we do need to pay attention to each part no good having a stadium if people come here and see people living on the streets so let 's you know at into all the work we can across our housing program yep and ask for you to support on that Thank You Aaron here we go sometimes say quit when you 're he 'd never healed well to that warning he got myself in plenty of situations and today won 't be any different I was always seeing myself as the odd one in and and that 's why I will start by first thinking that mirror and to my community which is around a particular intersection and we 've got a way forward we 'll see a report back to our community board and September with some options and we 'll see what the community sees in the community board sees about that at that time and move on so that 's all my good bits this and some great parts in this in this LTP I think Christchurch does here for most parts a really good future ahead of it the present with still plenty of bits broken isn 't so good especially for those in particular parts of the city businesses and the inner city people who live in the East and around drinking chlorine I 've always been totally opposed to chlorine and probably always will be and I think it 's a complete heav but beyond that I received an email yesterday from someone and be inside who 's got a family of four and the guy clearly stated that his rights bill is one month 's wages so one it wasn 't hot and he still got to pay insurance and he to pay for his kids school fees and lunches and everything else they do is a family but one month 's income is just rates and I think our rates are out of control and crash ditch I think five and a half percent is far too high which would be a lot closer to the rate of inflation the difference here between I think most of my fellow councillors in myself is I 'm cheap I 'm a I 'm a cheap guy I think I see myself as pretty average I grew up in average neighborhoods and I 'd even could afford a Ferrari I 'd never buy one I 'd always buy Ford most likely my wife wouldn 't leave me buy most the ones I like but if i spending the council 's money it would just be a toyota because it 's reliable and does the job what we haven 't done in this LTP is engaged the public enough we 've had feedback from Lisa and one person in the population and so you were kind of got a mandate legally speaking but we they haven 't told us exactly what they want or more to the point what they don 't want and that those are the conversations going forward that I think a lot more councils and governments need to have with their populations is about how not to spend money a lot of stuff we 've build and I look at community facilities and the one that was removed from Sun ovens on Colombo Street what was called the Lions team I thought was a standing facility I hired a number of times myself I thought it was really good value for money it was a really good building the cost of that one is just over 10% of the cost them of the one we will build and so that cost afore intial is just far too huge we need to curb our spending we haven 't done it during we haven 't asked enough questions around that in this LTP and I look forward to those conversations we will hopefully have going forward because I think I speak for a silent majority the 99% of the population not all I said on staff but that don 't engage with us and I look forward to them engaging with us more in the future after thank you I join others certainly and thanking the staff for a huge amount of work and also my fellow councillors I think there 's some sense the since we went out for consultation there 's some significant improvements that we are making and one that 's tin one that stands out for me is the area of social housing and the recommendation to support the 30 million dollar loan for a social housing provider there I think that 's very timely we know that there 's a desperate need for single and double bedroom units in social housing the figures from the greater Christchurch partnership are very worrying in terms of the of the future number of older people who are going to be only on superannuation and bother people with disabilities so like yeah I understand that our current weightless for example for social housing is over 500 people and one of our submitters you might remember said to us what if one you got to there they said well I actually think but why by actually now putting out the loan for the 30 million then in fact we will get the social housing which our staff have suggested that we will and they have estimated that over a three year period in fact we could get 190 social housing units built and that would be over an 8-year period to we 'd be looking at five hundred those are the figures that staff had previously given me so the other area to that I think there 's there 's been strong support for but also I think we 've been cautioned about is in the area of it cycleways I think what we 're doing is really good I 'm as I 've indicated I wasn 't prepared to have the rates put up because of them but I think putting in the two particularly besides what was voted today with the his cut of cycleway quorum ins trail and parts of the northwest arc will go a long way towards achieving what we want is a as a city for certainly heard from in order matter of the value or for older people cycling and also the value for people people 's health in the future Kia the other area that came through strongly for me and it 's close to my heart was the area of heritage and there was strong support from submitters that we put bring forward the Bechdel in landmark fund of one and a half million and I think it 's quite clear that the lien the lame these landmark buildings for example like the old post office in the square and and also the State Insurance Building in there 's the Peterborough quarter they have been part of Christchurch 's identity and that 's something that I think that this that this budget attempts to do in terms of keeping a balance it 's keeping the things that are important to people in I think the public spoke very clearly about the importance of having a multi-use arena and I certainly think that that will give the public the certainty as well as the other aspects of your budget so I I certainly can this budget is a three-stage thing getting the basics right we 're identifying getting those basics right getting things done and in delivering and I think the key part is actually delivery for us now we 're spending a lot of money this budget if you look through it there 's a lot of money being spent on things in our city getting things done and getting the basics right I remember sitting here when we adopted the draft long-term plan and saying I was disappointed that we weren 't maintaining our core basic infrastructure and I 'm really happy that we are now at least can say to our communities that the city 's foundation what we build everything else upon is actually going to be solid it 's not going to deteriorate any further than it already has because we 're spending a lot of money on the health of our city we want to be a well being city we need a healthy City that actually people can build upon and actually want to invest and want to live in and actually get caught to build a of momentum still staying within the Central City because we need to attract people to live in our central city we don 't have that at the moment we 're still 2,000 people living or 2,000 people less living in the Central City than when the earthquake happened and we 've got a long way to go to attracting more people to build their the getting things done part that I said in the second part is around the governance and decision-making process and the Meuse recommendations here around developing a committee for establishing well establishing a committee for the capital program there the council 's doing around 900 projects at the moment I don 't think many people in the city recognize how many projects this council was actually doing right now some of them are from just several thousand dollars in summer several hundred million dollars but 900 projects to govern to get things done city is a massive achievement and we actually need to have a very strong governance oversight on that and I 'm really happy that we 're actually going to establish something and that we you know we 're talking about value engineering or value adding so we can actually stop wasting money in areas that don 't need to be wasted and actually prioritize where money can actually be spent because there is a limited amount of money and that 's the next part about delivery delivering all these projects is going to be tricky for the city our debt levels are going to soar and it 's the next generation that 's going to have to look at that debt level how do we pay for it at the moment we 're borrowing but I really think that in the future we 're going to have to look at our assets and prioritize how we actually manage our assets how we own our assets and what partnerships we can bring to the city so that we can even start paying for and actually enhancing the the city 's operates so that 's so I 'm pleased that we 're getting the basics right I 'm pleased that we 're going to be looking at how we deliver get things done and but view is how we 're going to pay for everything in the future Pauline it 's true we did hear a lot of submitters talking about cool business but I don 't like to remind people that our roads and footpaths in three waters was actually well over 50% of our spend but even then we 've now increased the funding that we 'll be putting into our repairs of their footpaths and roads in also enter our renewals program because we 've listened and we also made provisions to up the maintenance of our parks and renewals and and including resourcing our Park Rangers which I think 's a really neat thing because it feeds into education programs and all sorts of wonderful things and we also heard from our submitters about community facilities though they 're really important along with our footpaths and roads and and I agree that these do form the heart of our communities and it was our strong communities that really helped us get through the terrible disaster of the earthquake so we 've provided a hundred and seventy thousand to begin investigative work any new ones and I think that 's a really good start and so and also we 're continuing work on building collaborative relationships with our residents and communities and I note in the Mears forward you said that we want to work with our communities not just for our communities and I think that 's a really strong statement it 's also supported strongly by the the grant to the edge we 're Paul that indicates we 're walking the talk here finally recognizing that this was a great project and recognizing the durability in the passion and desire for the return of the pool and that 's worthy of support and I know that will build an enduring relationship there because that 's what it 's about it 's not just saying here you go it 's actually walking alongside communities and this will be a great example of how we do things in the future as deal and referred to so along with the earthquake the floods the fires we now have the chlorination as you to deal with in the and the upgrading of our drinking we 've stepped up to this really well and plasti as I mentioned before additional funding for roads and footpaths and we 're still keeping the rates kept at the 5.5 nothing short of a miracle in my view and I know people still think that 's high and it is for some people no one 's disputing that but we do as Dion also say we do need to fund all these things somehow so it 's actually a good balance of our core responsibilities here was moving forward as in keeping the momentum in the city which is really happening and also getting our core business done that balance is really really important and we 've based our decisions on the feedback we 've heard through the submissions so in a way we 've got here today together with our residents not everyone gets what they want but I feel we 've done the best to provide a balanced way forward for the city of Christchurch normal to thank everyone everyone around this table all the staff but also the Mema says the public is engaged with us I think there 's some really good aspects of that the long-term plan and we 've definitely changed a few things from the draft to show that we are getting sound to get the basics right you know focusing on our drinking water especially in the time when obviously this the chlorination issue is hugely important and put enough money on budget to sort that out is important not just for the short term over the next eight months but also that the longer term to make sure acid is never permanently chlorinated spending more money on wastewater I think it 's really really important and we heard that a lot it 's also good to see extra money put into wrote in local rhodium maintenance and also safety you know you just have to walk around parts of Shirley just to see what those people have to live with broken footpaths broken streets endless constructions from the Dudley Creek works you know community well-being is hugely important and you know if fixing the roads helps that community well-being then we need to do it you know it 's time there 's been a lot of debate over the cycle waste and it 's really good to see that we are still pushing to if the cycle ways and we 're board pulled another couple forward and we 've got enough money on budget that once the NZTA released their financial assistance rates this potential to speed them up and get them completed as originally planned although there 's a lot of comments that the cycle ways and wanted I think that 's completely completely wrong you just have to look at the long-term plans submissions to see that support of the cycle ways drew the most submissions 282 and the majority were asking for the cycle waves to be bought forward and when you look at the negative ones actually even the residents survey there 's actually not that many negative comments you know 26 negative comments on cycleways does not mean the city does not want it you know I 've spoken to many people around New Zealand and in Christchurch we know we 're the envy of the other cities they they want to be like us 've done so far was seen increased insightfully numbers and we know how important that is for a city moving moving forward as the growth continues to go you know currently we 're building the northern the corridor which is just going to funnel thousands and thousands of extra vehicles into one of their older suburbs st. Albans it 's not going to fix congestion that 's going to make it worse and I know we went out on the consultation talked about a fuel tax you know that 's that 's not the answer we need to look at congestion Livi 's we can 't have people of Waimakariri come in and to enter christchurch and not contributed into actually the congestion that they are causing so there 's some there 's some good things but for me it 's something cause I 've said right from the start our rates are too too high they 'll way too high you know it 's a 10-year program and at the second half of it they are getting lower unfortunately be nice if we could actually stick to that 10-year looking at the next three years and I see huge pressure on a number of people you know just come out cloth and these tight times could have easily saved two percent each year on our rates we 're spending twenty million dollars on private heritage over the next 10 years there 's way too much you know we 're going to be giving Christ Eugene 's did an additional 1.2 million dollars on top of the 10 million dollars every year it 's just too much at this point of time you know we just need to be a little bit more prudent with our spending just to get over this tough picture I just think we 've missed the mark with there Sarah thank you and I just like to start with our strategic directions which we 're doctoring through this process climate change leadership active citizenship and connected communities increasing active and public transport use the post prosperous and sustainable city proactive approach to natural hazards and a safe and sustainable water supply with improved waterways they are future focused and will enable us to become a told us through the LTP consultation however is Joe Biden famously said don 't tell me what you value showing me your budget and I 'll tell you what you value and you know what this budgets our budgets doesn 't quite match your well-intentioned words and many aspects and our community has told us thus through their submissions but that 's not for the lack of trying on our part to get this right to balance all the calls from residents and we also have funding issues still to be sorted we 're awaiting the government 's new transport GPUs to be finalized and the NZTA funding assistant rates we still have the business cases and the capital acceleration fund to go into global settlement with the government for outstanding matters all of which will allow us to spend more and get more essential work done without the impact falling on ratepayers I know that many will be disappointed that we have not bought forward all of the psycho waste projects they were the most positively commented on aspect of the LTP but without the NZTA funding rates confirmed all 13 MCS are still on budget and we have added enough funding to complete them the cycleways all that 's right all in national and international evidence is clear in the new government direction is to use this evidence to build a transport system that actually works Christchurch is growing and we do not want to end up with Auckland 's congestion and disconnected communities we have a chance to be much better than late I think we 've got it pretty much right with our community facilities but was stunned when my taco taco taco the Sumner Community Center opened and this award-winning building was only open to the community for three hours total on the weekend so putting some additional funding and to hit the library and community center and public toilets open for longer hours on Saturday and Sundays is really welcomed while the coastal pathway is in the later years of the LTP I 'm really pleased that we 've put on budget enough money to get there difficult monks Basie complete the new plan for the GPS phone footpads should help make this much be having my boat recorded against a few of the recommendations so what is a few words why now I 'm in favor of a stadium and have been convinced by my colleagues that it needs a roof however I 'm not in favor of bringing it forward two years and in fact only 28 submitters asked us to do that for me it 's stadium viscosity infrastructure the two key reasons given for breaking the stadium forward certainty and it 's cheaper to build it the sooner you do it are the same or our core infrastructure we need to have the confidence in our waste water and drinking water up to modern standards and it will never be cheaper to do it now the stadium will be a nice nice to have but it simply isn 't as important as getting our core infrastructure up to scratch as soon as possible trying to cut it now because I 've got too much left to say I can do more at the time only a month ago the council narrowly passed a resolution to allow the capital endowment fund I only voted in favor of this because it was going to be the community uses all of the economic stuff had been used up and so I 'll be voting against it being used for the Christchurch in seed portion there and I 'm disappointed that we have not even inflation approved our community grants and know that the many community groups is submitted us to us will be as well I 'm not looking forward to the really tough decisions that will have to make and the Metropolitan strengthening communities funding round and September anyway I 'm looking forward to next year and the additional funding that we will have to truly become a 21st century sustainable and prosperous City Jamie I won 't speak to the LTP on the whole because that 's for Tuesday but I will briefly touch on the amendments here are we gonna do it all now yeah I will speak to the OT today once and we 'll do it well getting synergies okay well I will be speaking to the OTP on the whole today and not Tuesday so thank you of funding for local pool additional Park Ranger funding and virus straws Green prescriptions and a swim program and the exploration of fuel tax these are all items that I haven 't supported in these amendments here I don 't get a lot of teacher from saying no to these things because I think they 're all good causes but our role is about making those hard calls no one ever said it was going to be easy identifying what you think you could do without there 's always way tougher than saying what you could what you could live with or what you could do with I 'm not in favor of bringing forward the major cycleways roots when our roads and footpaths remain in the state they 're in a clear message that we did hear from the community as the importance of the expedited multi-use arena I 'm very much in favor of this and bringing the funding forward and I 'm very supportive and endorse our clear intention for it to be a closed roof facility missing that opportunity would just be a travesty so whilst that that stadia is a nice-to-have well I think it 's a need to have for the city is because there 's been a tremendous amount of investment that has gone and on the basis that this would happen and we 've got it honor that the reality is the crown and the council ain 't going to rebuild Christchurch it it 's largely going to be the private sector and we can do our part but fundamentally it has to come from external sources and I think that the crown councils need to hold up their end of the bargain I am in favor of the back-to-basics approach so I do endorse that theme but I think the biggest concern that I hold is the level of rates rates rises and it needs to be top of mind and I don 't think this is isolated to Christchurch I think this is a local government problem across the nation that the level of rates rises a completely unsustainable and ultimately that house of cards will fall down because they are rising it level was far faster than inflation and it 's going to come and we 're going to have to look at that we 're going to take with a you a GC with a uniform annual general charge next year and that 's been signaled and in the mayor 's recommendations I welcome that it 's still not going to be sitting the silver bullet and I think the last point I 'll make on rates is that I think people can swallow the fact that they 're not always going to be even in that 's okay so long as their fear and the problem with their rating system is that isn 't fair I 've got a young couple that I know he works a 9 to 5 job as an Operations Manager and she has a small business that employs 2 to 3 people their rates are 30 grand because they live in Finland their houses also is as whereas it is simply not fair it 's it 's a blunt instrument of the wealth tax in someone 's capital value isn 't actually a good indication of someone 's wealth at the end look at that we 're not doing that today though and the u AG C is going to be a start but the final point that I 'll make is that I 'm heartened by our commitment to be chlorine-free as fast as humanly possible I commend the mayor 's stance on this and I really like to make it very clear that all of us around the council are unanimous and our desire to have this toxin gone from our water supply as soon as we possibly can and I think that not one person in Christchurch will the Graduate meant that if we 're going to gold-plate one thing that it will be our water supply so well done to to the mirror that to my colleagues and especially to staff for all the hard work on this it 's long term plan that 's compromised from from everyone but our one job is to sign off a budget and we 'll be able to do thank you in Matata omocha URI I 'm Marie I can a for us and our children after us this long to today but we are making decisions that will directly affect the lives of our children and their children after them Thank You Lian for your recommendations that I am delighted to support thank you to to my fellow councillors and to staff for the combined effort and a huge amount of work that 's gone into getting us to this place I think this reflects these recommendations reflect both what we have heard from our communities about what we should focus on and also it aligns beautifully with our strategic priorities that we that we will also be signing off that we all agreed upon when we first started this journey is a council so we want us the city to be one that has a water supply that is pure and fresh and clean and and safe to drink we want a city that enables active citizenship and connected communities we want one that maximizes opportunities to develop itself into a vibrant prosperous in sustainable 21st Century City and we want one that takes leadership and the addressing climate change in take in making informed and proactive approaches to public and sheer transport opportunities and empty views safe and to be a place where our children are able to walk safely to school I canvassed some of my local young people and they the first thing that they want from us is to be able to walk bike and scooter to school safely so I 'm delighted that we have got this focus we 're bringing funds to improving our safety around a street a local rate so that their parents can be confident that their children are able to travel to school using active transport in a safe way they won 't have to bring them to school in their cars which will mean less congested roads and alleviate the safety issues around schools is congestion is an ongoing issue so I think that this long-term plan provides reassurance to them that we have heard their voices and we are listening to them and we are putting what we 're making this city what it should be for them I 'm confident that by adopting these recommendations we 're satisfying the needs for good economic outcomes for our social housing to rebuild back to previous clip quake levels which means that we 're showing that we are compassionate and caring City so I 'm delighted to be supporting these recommendations and I 'm confident that this ltb will position our city is one that we his reputation for being a city of opportunity going forward thank you thank you David thank you firstly can I just acknowledge my colleagues and staff for the collaboration and work we 've done over the last nine months plus generally I 've been a very strong advocate of attending two core functions of the council roading three waters essential community services the Mears forward and mayor 's recommendations I 'm generally supportive of everything we have before us today and I 'd like to acknowledge the commitment to South bright and South Shore and the sticks areas and we 'll be looking to positive and equitable actions following completion of the regeneration strategy and also rephrasing of the land drainage recovery program budgets or the sticks remedial actions I 've made some points where I 'm opposed to an aspect of the desperate needs across the city including in my area in the east one thing I 'm very keen to see happen and we did talk about it from the external advisory group there 's prioritizing of the remedial works of the worst roads in Christchurch and then attending to that I don 't see that happening in any great degree yet cycleways I 'm not against cycle waste per se but I am extremely concerned about some of the designs and options that we have enacted around the city and we 've divided communities over some of those although numerous submissions were received in favor of it many conversations that I have around town people express their concern and around the extent and number of cycle ways social housing again I 'm not against social housing I consider it not a core function for councilman and would ultimately like to see council housing totally separate from all council operations and independently operated the multi-purpose arena I 'm exceedingly and totally supported of advancing the funding in the LTP for this project and endorsed all the comments that Tim Scandrick made for investigating alternative sources the fuel tax I 'm opposed to at this stage until we get some parity of of cost of fuel across the country and avoid this South Island subsidization of fuel headroom is a big concern for me and I know that you know we will sort of be around that 20 to 21 percent in a few years time and I really do consider it 's time to consider options around seeking strategic partners and selling down some of our strategic assets it 's not selling assets its accessing funding from our assets and still retaining majority shareholding in control of these assets and finally I just like to endorse I think everybody 's comments around the room that we need to accelerate as fast as possible the chlorination removal of their waterway and get on with it I think Jamie said pretty much everything else I 'd like to say about that so thank you thank you Jimmy King thank you Jericho I knew haseo konnichiwa a mistake buenas Dias cough a la una are you problem Mulaney could Homolka salon Mabuhay the mayor if we reveal the council strategic framework consists of the vision of a church community outcomes and the strategy are the priorities I think we all see and we all agreed we wonder is the city the cameras safe clean green innovative sustainable inclusive and international election the city solar long temper in 2008 18 to 28 will be the most important not only the strategic document but also a powerful tool to achieve the coming outcomes for the Easter City so I agree you know most of the amazed the recommendation for instance I agreed ensure our city belching water supply is safe secure and I 'm pollinate and also I agree to maintain and renew the waste of water infrastructure I also agree to reduce the flood risk or one above particular wonderful area there 's a candle in relation to other health and even dur to our lives and also I agree to improve our role in the footpath particular lost area in the poor condition condition also Alfre to support maintaining momentum in our city however I 'm disappointed in two kind of facility first one out two years of the new southwestern Leisure Centre in a library and service center facility I consider wave a series the timing of the funding for a southwest area new facility and also the library the home the area desperately we needed such a new facility and I 'm totally committed to delivery this as soon as possible so in a way they meets the needs of my community I consider moving in amendment to have the funding push out by one year only rather than the mayor 's the recommendation for two years however I decided not to as I 'd realized there is a significant body of work to be done with the community to find a site for the new facilities so I also understand the offending have been proud of over as necessary once this work has been done so my key message to the people today is that I 'm totally committed to delivery the new facility for a people or wider homie from the area and also for the people of high church as passed as quickly as possible and I will do require work quickly but generally speaking I fully supported is the long term plan thank you very much brief mingy yeah thank you yeah me overall I think this has been a good process in terms of discussing bodies you know still quite a complex financial situation for the council I 'm happy to support the mayor 's recommendations I think they do reflect the basics and they reflect resident surveys in terms of what the public expect us to be spending money on water supply every day people need water drinking water wastewater to flush away the waste footpaths to walk on and roads to travel on whether you 're on a car bike or a bus these are really the basics that everyone needs to access every day and I think it 's right that some of that funding has come forward into those areas so that 's good I just want to raise three general issues which you know weren 't always covered in the plan but I think we need to keep an eye to one is the level of rates and you know the rates has crept up from our last LTP where we did try to get to keep it at a 200 percent of net to revenue ratio and that is concerning I don 't think the demands on the city are going to lessen so I do think we need to think we 'll rethink and partial asset sales that will reduce debt I think there 's extra cash on our balance sheet that we could release an over book value that cash could be employed in extra investment I also think the idea of listing assets on the market actually is quite good for the city Wellington and Auckland both have the airport 's listed is actually great I mean we need some more focus on Christchurch we need to improve our brand as an open city innovative and enterprising and I think those are some of the extra benefits of having some of your assets listed there 's no issues there so I think we need to reconsider that I think also we need to present our financial information in a much more accessible way with the technology that we get better at the way we present these reports the LTP is still very old school and we don 't get a lot of people engaging in it so I think one of the things we do need to work on is the way we present these budgets actually understand where we 're spending the money on and then reflect their feedback I also think we need to take into account the impact of a potential global settlement with the crown it 's long overdue I think that we will finish it by the end of this year the use of the capital acceleration fund and streamlining the post-earthquake structures such as regenerate Christchurch and DCL which should yield some savings and lead to a more efficient and understandable system for the people so if I think we get those things done we 'll be in a good place and hopefully we can deal with some of that stuff thank you Andrew thank you I 'd like to start by thanking staff for all the work that they 've done throughout the development of the plan I 'd like to like to thank council colleagues for the collaborative approach that we 've taken to what at times have been quite difficult decisions and I actually think all of that has been reflected very well in the meeting that we 've had here this morning I like also the fact that we 've made changes to the plan as a result of the submissions that we 've received and submissions that we 've heard and also as a result of the results of the recent resident satisfaction survey and this is all led us to what really is more of a back-to-basics approach so I welcome the focus on roads and footpaths please that there 'll be an increased budget and a focus on banks peninsula roads as long as as well as those in other areas including a working party of the Bank spirit of community board and community members to input into the prioritization and into the good practise of banks peninsula road repairs and upgrades I also welcome to focus on three waters I 'm pleased that will now not see any regression in the waste water Network which is clearly aligned to the improvements that we need and want to make in those areas and funding for priority work to get the chlorine out of the water within the signal 12 months I 'm also pleased to see that there 's now fun on budget for delivery were fit for purpose drinking water scheme for Akane 's Bay on Banks Peninsula bringing forward of improvements to the diamond Harbour Wharf is a key investment in public transport infrastructure and I 'm also pleased to see that improvement work to the akaroa Wharf will continue pretty much immediately with design and consultation taking place over the next financial year I 'm also delighted that we 've got in this plan over ten million dollars for development of the navel point area this has been a long awaited project which has got both local and metropolitan possibly even regional benefits and I 'm pleased that listen will now allow for the boat safety improvements that have been needed for some time car parking interventions and the partnership opportunity with the navel point Club to be achieved and improvements to from the nearby oil tanks I 'm also pleased to see the 30 million for social housing in the plan and welcomed the opportunity as we 've heard this morning to look in detail at options for increasing the level of service for social housing in the next few months so considering that we remain in a constrained and complex financial environment and with much work still to do and we 've got a coherent financial strategy that with careful consideration and discipline is not required the divestment of our asset holdings and in my view it doesn 't need to whilst borrowings hi it remains within acceptable debt to revenue ratios which are forecast to come back to more normal levels over time much of what we 're building and spending has got intergenerational benefits and it 's entirely appropriate the costs are also borne across generations we 've got an infrastructure strategy that sees improvements to networks over the life of this plan balancing that we 're taking into account community expectations around vertical infrastructure such as swimming pools and community centers and we 've achieved all of rates program to decrease overall too much reasonable levels during the life of this plan and it 's required discipline to remain within those increase envelopes and I hope that future councils will retain that discipline so that we can get rates increases back to reasonable levels as early as possible so overall I think this is a good plan that we 've put together in still quite a difficult situation and I 'm pleased to be able to support it today thank you all very much look can I just wrap up by saying again thank you to all of the staff involved it 's been an extraordinary effort to get to this point and I know that there 's still a little bit of work to be done but thank you very much for for all of that work it has been outstanding and I too want to thank all of the my colleagues around the table it 's you know sometimes it has to be a bit of give-and-take and everyone 's been prepared and willing to work collaboratively and to understand that you know not everyone have you know priorities in one area others have priorities in another area that it 's all valuable you know that 's how complex decisions are made and we 're in a complex environment we have challenging issues that we have to confront but you know my experience is that we all listen to each other and whether we agree or not we respect the fact that we have all been elected to represent the people of Christchurch and we 're here with the best interests of the city at heart so thank you to each and every one of you for the contribution that you have made I also want to thank the over 1,500 people and organizations who submitted on our long term plan and just to also to make the point though that they weren 't the only ones who participated I know that community board members and councillors were out and shopping malls and various other places engaging with the public and not all of them would have tuned in to submissions but there was that connection made and people understood that there was a process a number also attended residents association meetings and Business Association meetings and went to board meetings and various other group meetings around the city and just engaged on the on the content of the of the long-term plan we also from a personal point of view I do very much hear concerns that have been expressed around the table around the level of debt I do worry about where the head room is heading and although we 've maintained you know sufficient to give us by the Prudential test I think where we are challenged to think about that a lot more carefully and I want us to think about that certainly as we go forward from here I 'm also concerned about rates and creases the the the comparison that we make with other cities is always based on the average house price and so you know I do receive the odd email from people sort of saying I would pay a lot less in Oakland and my rates if I if I live there compared to Christchurch and I would like to take a picture of what a send it back and say but this is what you 'd be living in because the average the average house price is what the average rate represents and so and I kind of want to pick up on what one of the counselors said about you know the mechanism that rates represents and actually this is not a good way to to to provide or to fund services for a city of our size and scale to have it purely based on the capital value of property isn 't enough you know and we do have our our asset base from which we do receive a rate of return but it is a mixed rate of return across their asset mix and and I think that we do need to we do need to think very seriously and how we resolved for some issues but again that 's for another another occasion but I think you know to look to central government to partner and new ways of delivering services that are much more connected with communities central government local government partnerships are the way to go and I think as well has established a core group within the Department of Internal Affairs which has the sole function of looking for that central government local government partnership and out of that and all of the funding reviews that are going on at the moment I hope that central government comes up with a better way of enabling us to fund core infrastructure at the same time as connecting with our communities because you know the the reestablishment of the full well beings and legislation is very much a part of who we are as a city you know in terms of what we want to achieve I 'm going to be very focused on establishing the capital infrastructure the capital program sort of oversight committee or whatever it 's going to be called I can 't think what a what a dreadful acronym that might make and but I will think of an appropriate one but it will be a committee of the whole Council and I think will enable us to ensure that we are monitoring progress in a way that doesn 't do well on a no surprises to describe that so again thank you all very much you know these these these debates actually I 've really enjoyed the debate I 've really enjoyed listening to well everyone has had to say so on that note I shall put the motion what I thought we did no do we have to can I put the vote and then come out of standing orders yeah okay so I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you and so we 've got a couple more resolutions to go so we 've passed all of those so now doing this in the right order that the council reinstates the Standing Orders suspended earlier in the meeting I 'll move that Sikandar by Mike I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye all those opposed to no that 's carried and there is another resolution which is that and we took out the infrastructure strategy didn 't_''_7483.579 we so that the council adopts the summary of the rates impact and net debt ratio impact adopts the changes and L all right yes okay so it was updated attachment see so so that 's been moved by me and seconded by you Andrew yep so I 'll put that motion glitches in regards to the development contributions policy I don 't see any specific reference to us adopting it today in the last LTP we did adopt development contribution policy and they 're just wondering if I 've so we normally I it was my understanding that we would normally adopt a development contribution policy that 's it so we can do that any time okay so just in terms of recording but some of these resolutions those things that obviously we 've already done there we 've done it for your recommendation yes we haven 't done it for this no no the cathedral rate is separate that 's with we stick we haven 't_''_7601.59 done that yet yeah we we 're not doing that till next week we 're not doing that till Tuesday yes so you 're moving wait one minute it 's subsequently changed and consulted on after the because it 's some it the very last point so the adopt it would be adopting it as it is currently sitting and thanks thanks for clarifying yeah so I just wanted my vote recorded then against the capital program right so you want to vote against adopting the proposed changes to the council 's capital program set out an attachment D so that 's all right right so I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you and we 've got no no no that goes let 's cross that out delete and this is where we stop I think I think we 've done we 've done all that we need to do now so I 'll just okay sorry we 've done that so so so now we have adopted the recommendations as amended we have adopted Colleen 's report as a Mendes and we are now going to simplify the final version of the infrastructure strategy which I 'm really grateful to staff for putting on the effort to do this I think it will really help make it more and and and then we 'll formally adopt the long term plan on Tuesday so we 're almost there and neurology in the meeting until 30 Tuesday morning thank you very much thank you _"

I 'll hand over to Andrew as he was the chair of the report but just to note that we 're not dealing with the entire report we 're just dealing with the items that the committee wanted reported to this meeting prior to the conclusion of the financial year Andrew yes so the whole report as has been said will come through with the with the minutes of the the meeting in the normal way but there were a number of things that came up in the discussion about the the reports which we felt were appropriate to have reported to this meeting given that this is the last council meeting prior to consideration of the LTP and we were certainly keen to pick up any things that that could inform that discussion or that we might want to do work on before we locked the final LTP down so the registered food premises once a year there have been some changes to the regulatory environment that mean that we we needed to consider changing that target for that level happens when there is a change in the environment a change in the regulatory environment or when something happens and the current challenge is that we 've got around chlorination of the water supply would be a good example of that they have a lot of north inquiring what do we then do to trigger a change to our level of service to reflect that change in the regulatory environment or when something has happened which potentially changes the way we would look at a particular level of service so that 's what gave rise to item three in front of us today agrees that where there 's a change to the environment for example in event incidents or change to regulatory regulatory requirements in order to maintain purpose levels of service service plans will be immediately reviewed by staff and proposed changes to the level of service will be referred to the next meeting of the Finance and Performance Committee for recommendation to the council so that means that there 's where there is that change it immediately triggers that review by staff and it immediately then triggers the performance so that we can consider on recommendation from staff who 've considered this whether any change to the level of service is required and so that we can get that change to the level of service in place as soon as possible to reflect that new environment the additional staff recommendations additional information regarding the proposed changes to level of service in relation to the general service satisfaction of point of contact surveys the surveys have been reported they 're available on our website we were very keen to make sure that the results of those surveys obviously generate work which addresses some of the issues that have come up and we 've got the additional appendices to the report today which deal with some of those issues and work streams which will be underway in order for that to happen and of course Carlene has got some work underway within the organization and particularly with the ELT to make sure that there are some work programs particularly designed to address some of the issues that the the point of contact survey and the resident satisfaction survey have brought to the EAG report that we will be continuing to review levels of service on an ongoing basis probably through the committee 's after the LTP has been decided and of course the resident satisfaction survey point of contact survey and what we 've heard through the LTP submissions process will all come into play any consideration that we have of whether the current levels of service reflect the concerns of our residents this obviously relates to to that area as well and in fact 0.5 in these recommendations note that the LT will be doing some work there and obviously picks up the surveys and the LTP feedback and then there 's additional information provided again as a further appendix to today 's report just looking at the levels of service as they relate to those areas that came up as concerns in the surveys that I 've been talking about so there are a couple of additional appendices which relate to the particular matters that we 'd requested we brought to this meeting from finance and performance outside of the normal reporting cycle just in case there was LTP or work that saying won 't necessarily be reflected in the LCP but will be done between now and the annual plan next year or any updated LTP next year thank you I 'll just pass over to the chief executive to make some comments thank you I just want to reiterate some of the things the deputy mayor has said so the issues and levels of service we have hundreds of people 's of service we have both levels of service related to LTP and what we call non LTP levels of service which are really around management accountability levels of service they were you 've seen a lot of these previously so in the development of the long term plan in the service plans there 's been earlier discussions around those and also workshops around specific areas in recent times around you know roads and transport and three waters so we 've had some look at those in preparation for their LTP but it doesn 't need to be a rolling process over the next three years so that we continue to look at these and more given that they 're so important I think that issue about levels of service those be quite complex and they 're often a proxy for what it is that people are actually looking for so a resident satisfaction depends on a whole range of things that depends on your level of investment in particular areas that depends on progress or changes that depends on our response to complaints and concerns that people hear and just the experience of things so it might be the experience of a service but it might be experience of you know driving down the road every day and roads are a good example so one of our lowest satisfaction even Crete with quakes was to do with the smoothness of roads so what people need to see post-earthquake is actually progress around things and I think I mentioned previously it seems now that residents have been in the past could see the big stuff that 's going on now they 're worried about the potholes outside of their house every time they drive drive out of their driveway so it 's become a much more important but there are other things that we need to do and that 's why we 've linked the response and the workaround the residents do they and the other information that we have from the submissions in their hearings to looking at what 's the program of work that we need to understand think about the reasonable survey as a proportion of it was around how council making makes decisions and the information around that so people understand how they can participate how they can influence decisions and what those decisions are as well as specific areas such as roads and our three waters in appearance of some of our parks and waterways so that we need to do better in terms of people 's experience in the understanding of what happens so some of the week we 'll look at excuse me how we provide you with better information to support your decision-making how we allow people to really understand that so reports not being so technical but actually being more accessible and understandable for people and engaging people earlier before decisions are made and thinking about being deliver services but also in the way that we communicate things so there 's quite a big piece of work that needs to happen around it but certainly I think that the hearings the submissions and things like the various residents see those we do we do quite a few surveys will input into that process and will continue to feedback probably initially through finance and performance excellent right any questions Yanni I 'm just in terms of the residents survey and the you know the very damning targets and the actuals around the percentage of residents feeling that they have some influence and understanding how we make decisions and feeling like they can participate it would sooner me that there 's some governance legal decisions that we need to make so it 's not just a measure for the chief executive I 'm sorry I just wanted what 's the best way of getting that addressed I mean I 'm just really concerned that these targets are not being met quite significantly lower than target and there 's a number of practices that we have that are not helping interrupting you but as I 've explained to counselors before some of the structures that we have in place around decision making are clearly not working as well as they could and I 've already for example suggested that we shift to capital program monitoring committees that has full responsibility for the entire capital program I guess I was more interested in the sort of short-term things like we 're currently consulting on things like master road plans or we 're you know different transport projects and I 'm just really concerned that we 're still not applying anything different to those look I think I think I 'd rather wait for the analysis to come through from staff because you know I think that you can you can look at some of the results and you know through one particular lens but actually if you put a slightly different lens on it and you ask yourself the question do I as a resident of the city understand why if I ask for something to be done or the council asks for something to be consulted on and I put put on do I feel like I 've been able to influence so there 's more than one issue and there 's more than one type of consultation and engagement one of the things that you have raised on many occasions yani as the need to move to hearings panels and and having report backs from hearings panel for decision-making or even having hearings panels delegated decision-making and I think that sort of approach is actually worth things like you know we just had the wall stir and drop-in sessions for example but I don 't know that counts all the characters are invited to to hear so the counselors are making decisions but sometimes we 're not given copies of the submissions we 're not invited to the meetings where people actually you know we are given copies of the other submissions I think that we need to have a proper discussion around the framework for the type of decision and you 've raised this on many occasions and you know I think I would like you to be happy that you have finally been heard by me certainly decisions about where we 're delegations could properly enable for example a community board and conjunction with maybe some what we do so we 'll be putting some work together to understand a range of things some of it will be around governance in decision-making how we can support it and then I think it 's worthwhile having a bit of a workshop your feet will just let and can I and and just suggest that we just complete the LTP for that but then we can focus on there and so yeah I mean I just want to completely support the what the chief executive just said because we 've got to focus on the on the the LTP which is why this report is here now and the next step is to make sure that we build a proper governance framework that will support the organisation right okay so you concerns that we post identified we feed into the chief executive so that things like number of actually key learnings well if you you can do that and then we can incorporate that but I think it 's you feel it works there any other questions just I don 't know if it 's possible for the community board maybe to get briefed on the odor complaints or whether that the Eddie committee will pick that up it was really good to have that information and I don 't want to take time today during into the specifics all of that but it did seem that it does raise some questions around where the complaints are coming from and what 's being done would you like that and the first instance to be with the chairs and then under vigil committees kind of called called the team and whatever it may be better going through the local community boards as well so that the project is every community board yes but for the community board areas what where there 's a number of complaints what I know but the specific projects that have been done to address that complaints in those areas I just think that would be useful yeah can we can we use the older one okay so why don 't we start with circulating the getting more detailed information that the community refers to team projects happening in the first three years of the LTP right it doesn 't refer to what those projects are okay well we can get that information yeah yeah I just wanted to make a general comment yeah well I 'll get a mover and a seconder for so Andrew you 'd like to move there Sikandar by and Galloway so open that up for discussion Andrew thank you just a couple of further comments on the residue satisfaction survey and point of contact surveys clearly you know we 've heard from residents through these two surveys and we 've also heard from residents on a wide range of issues through the LTP engagements and and submissions process as well and it 's been really interesting sitting here listening to residents and their concerns and seeing you know what happens of concern and particularly from particular areas of the city and to line those up with what we 've heard through the surveys which have been reported in in quite a timely way so that we can consider them at but I think the key message here this morning is that we 're really gearing up to respond to the results of these surveys and what we 've heard through the LTP submissions and obviously the analysis of the survey results of the importance in that regard our first opportunity to respond will be in the decision-making meetings for the LTP that start next Friday but also through the work that we 're doing reviewing those service plans systematically over the next period and and obviously that could well result in some changes to levels of service to better reflect the concerns and the aspirations of our residents and our communities so I think it 's absolutely clear that is elected members and I refer to the comments made by the chief executive this morning as well but we 're taking this is an absolute priority and I also agree with my colleague counselor Johansson that looking at governance and decision-making processes is going to be a key part of what we need to look at over the next period and I absolutely looking at look at look forward to reflect the expectations of our community in the way that we do things yonni just to make several points um one is that we also had a quite expensive communication to review that cost 80,000 there are a number of recommendations in there which I think would be timely to revisit because I think what 's really important is that we we developed to weigh what was the data that I don 't mean to interrupt that was a prayer I just wanted to make sure you 're talking about that report everyone um so some of us were here not just me but actually there was a number of things that actually you know in terms of building relationships with people regular meetings with two-way communication between us and and and others was quite valuable I thought but also you know I welcome the opportunity to look at how we make decisions and as it 's been said it you know have been concerned that we 've gone away from giving people having hearings where people can work through the issues Tim quite a formal structure I think we things get delegated to either a committee and there 's no local representation or people don 't feel that they 're locally elected people can actually make it make a decision on something then that does create an issue so looking at the community board delegations I think we we need to get on and do that you know that 's been outstanding for a long time now and the sooner we get the clarity around that then I think we can really improve how we do some of those governments things there is a disconnect at the moment between things that come as part of community board recommendations to Council for decisions and the information around that so I think that 's really important to review there what there was a very good liter and 2016 regarding the Rapanui cycleway with a number of learnings and I think you know it may be timely to go back and reflect on that because actually it would seem to me that there was a number of really sensible things in there but still I 'm not seeing those big be consistently know let 's learn from what 's happened previously so we don 't repeat those mistakes um I did want to acknowledge the success of QE 2 reopening and one of the performance measures that we were failing was people going to our Rick and sport centres hopefully that one I think is no longer going to fail given the the popularity and and the only other point I wish to make was um I think it 's really interesting looking at the water reticulation and and and the the huge issue with water water breaks along our water mains and so I think we really do need to really think about that in terms of the LTP in terms of the skirt legacy what we can see quite clearly from this report there 's the huge impact that that 's having and that is very real in terms of risk and you know we will obviously rightfully focus on the chlorination issue but we also have a major issue with our water main reticulation system in the city that does need to be addressed which this report was highlighting Oder advice I think that 's really useful there 's a number of improvements there that staff have recognized and I think at a governance it would be good to have an ability to endorse those at some stage all right I shall put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much and now we will move on to the what 's called the wellhead some improvement report and I 'd like to invite how Environment Program Manager water supply to come to the table and just before I welcome Helen to speak to what is her first report and her new role as the program manager for water supply improvement I just want to quickly remind people how we have got to where we 've got to and just to remind people that on the last working day before Christmas the drinking water Assessor withdrew our provisionally secured status due to the lack of security that was found to be the case around our our water heats as a council we made the decision to temporarily chlorinate the 12 months on the basis that during that period of time we would be able to come up with a strategy to remove the the chlorination and reinstate or fast-track the progress that we were already making on bringing our well heads up to a modern standard above ground of course the council had already made the decision to go down that track a long time ago after the earthquakes it was decided not to continue to put well heads below ground it was decided to bring them above ground and that program of work had already started which which has put us in a better position than we would have been in had that approach not been adopted the medical officer of Health sat at the end of the table and told us that if we did not make the decision to temporarily chlorinate our water he had a requisition already written that would have required the council to chlorinate and we decided as a council to take responsibility for making that decision temporarily for 12 months in order to give staff the opportunity to come up with a to our supply being unclear inators and and so the work has been you know sort of fast-tracked since then and significant progress is being made but I just want to kind of reiterate because I think that there 's been a misconception out there that we have to bring all of our well heads above ground for us to get our chlorination Bri status restored that is not the case we do not have to complete all of that work before we take the chlorine out of the water and so I just wanted to reiterate a comment that I 've made on more than one occasion and that is there I will fight tooth and nail to have uncoordinated water as I know there every other person around this table feels just as strongly about it this isn 't a competition for how strongly people feel about it we 're all Christchurch residents we all know that this is part of who we are as a city and we have all looked at the heavy lock north situation and we know it 's not our story and Havelock pond that Ben was able to lead to the borer which was part of a unconfined aquifer an aquifer they thought was confined it wasn 't we are talking about our confined aquifers and it is a completely different system they see that was unlikely that the source of the contamination was the bore head but they did make the point in the paper makes this point that they didn 't have a good system of monitoring their water safety plan wasn 't up to scratch all of the things that we do and can rely on because our staff have actually created a program of excellence around the delivery of our water our pristine water from our confined aquifers to our to our to those of our residents we have we have we 're able to rely on that so the situation is quite different from from have Locke North but I don 't regret the decision that we made because we need to have our medical officer of Health on-site we do need to work with the variety of regulators that are in this field and we do capable of making the right decisions for our community in terms of the water so I just want to come hell or high water commit to this 12 months no pressure over ta the goal of the program is to ensure that our water suppliers both safe and which drink so that means improving the security of our well hits and our pump stations and progressively removing that chlorine so you have acknowledged that there has been considerable debate about whether or not we can achieve this within the 12-month period that does remain the target however it is a challenge so as you 've as you 've noted we will not have brought all of our below ground well heads above ground in that 12 months period we 're not able to do that but there are two other options in terms of getting secure status for a promise session one is we could use alternative disinfection so we are exploring ultraviolet radiation and ozone treatment and the other is that we could isolate where we have a single below ground wellhead and a majority of above-ground wellheads we just from the above-ground wellheads in some cases so success depends and part on the resources we can bring to the program and accelerate the work program and it depends in part on the people of Christchurch cooperating with us in a probable water conservation program so in order to be able to deliver water to the city to meet the demand of the city and carry out the repairs we have to take a number of wells offline now in Christchurch our winter demand is approximately half of our Sun demand so if we can hold the demand closer to winter levels then summer levels right throughout the year we have a much greater chance of delivering this program so we will be talking about a water conservation programme the other thing that the paper touches on is the physical works that have been carried out and here the team have been quite modest about what has already been done so as you know there are four pump stations where we are not coronating and those 11 well heads have been signed off by engineers is secure and those 're we are not chlorinating we will favour the use of those pump stations and maximise the water that we can put out into the network fries we 've also made improvements to below ground well heads across the whole of the city so we are where the risks has been pointed out where the greater risks were improvements have been made to those well heads well they haven 't been brought up to the standard where they can be signed off as they are better than they were before all of us was his was done we also explored the reduction of the initial chlorine dose and effectiveness of chlorine in terms of a disinfectant is about both the dose in the time of contact before someone takes a glass of water to drink so where we 've got a longer contact time we can reduce that initial dose and there 's some work being done around the city to do that the other work that 's been done and I think people would have seen it around the city is that we are flushing pipes where we getting from statistics that we 're keeping on complaints about taste and odor that that has been effective so there are reducing taste and odor complaints around the city it may also be that the chlorination is slowly moving its way through the organic matter in the system so that may be reducing anyway but the flushing can only help so that work has been done the other aspect of the paper for you to note particularly is the first tranche of works for those seven pump stations and that 's essentially where we can get quick ones so two of those pump stations the work is out to tender and for five of them the design work is just being completed we won 't know the timeframe for when we can deliver there until we get the tenders begun but we 'll certainly provide updates to that once those four pump stations once those pump sessions come online with the other four that will supply about a quarter of the supply across the city with so we 're continuing to investigate the options for the other forty two pump stations we want to go we 're still exploring all of those options and making sure we take the best approach for each of them and what we 're proposing is a regular monthly report on progress both with the physical works and with the options for those future pump stations and I 'm happy to take questions thank you very much Dave David and then Jamie operation of their water supply in the city we had a number of pressure zones that seemed to surround the city is it possible to do a lot of work in one pressure zone and then isolate that from there from the rest and have absolute Laurine free status there or do you still need to have some connectivity to rely on pressure or flow across the city I 'm gonna invite bridgett O 'Brien in to answer that one because it 's a technical question that is beyond my knowledge of the system morning um yeah winter demand is about half of their summer demand so what we could do is zone by zone as fix enough of the pump stations to supply than fixing all of the pump station some of which are only needed for a few days each summer and one zone and so that way we 're fixing across the city it 's the current the current proposed approach okay to me regarding to the remove all those combination the work poke when you consider for our ties all those where a pump station as well as the water conservation campaign initiate will will be do this water conservation where she not campaign initiate wet so the water conservation campaign is probably not necessarily during the winter yes but we will initiate it as the weather warms up through the summer so a lot of the summer demand of course is people watering Gardens in moons so you mean the later after the six months almost twenty one or some other the where he accomplished in all all theory under control in air after six months it way is the widow warms up okay thank you um Paulina minyan II he think he actually suggest you putting that time forward because I think personally mulching a garden is the people are planting any gardens from you know possibly August maybe one of the messages the my question this actually on page 10 you say you 've received the device on European best practice for unclear native water supplies what is it I mean it 's gonna be big what does it look like so we 've got a draft report on the approaches in Europe where they have made you even surprised that I 'm not being but we haven 't fully assisted honey thank you for the update and the information was just wondering we 've got a map online but there 's not if you click on the little blue things that come up there 's really no information about what 's been done have we got a process underway to sort of put a little bit more information about you know the number of well heads that are above or below ground the tranche that they 're in what 's being looked at is there any way that we can just I guess from people in local areas who have it you know individual concern over in their local area that they can get a sense of what 's being done so the Met the Met that 's gone up you 're right his rudimentary information and at the moment the second question I had was in regards to that the ozone and the UV treatment and the beaker report that came out to government they they make the comment that that from 2009 onwards national baseline monitoring has shown the risks of protozoa in our natural waters may be overstated and particular groundwater sources it talks about the outbreak at have lot north thing of bacterial origin and that the argument should be that you know water supply should focus more on bacterial compliance rather than protozoa because the bulk of the upgrading cost is asserted with UV treatment so he just kind of helped me at a high level understand how we 're weighing that that kind of overstated aspects of the protis our risk versus what we 're doing until you look at ozone and UV so um Ministry of Health and crisis city council be measuring produce some Ministry of Health across in any groundwater supply including including Christchurch so the thinking is that the drinking water standards are too conservative in terms of the risk of protozoa for groundwater supplies but still but they 're still the drinking water standards haven 't_''_3472.219 been changed to reflect that so that may come in a future a vision but in the meantime we still have to try and comply with the current ones the UV is an option the focus would be I mean while it would treat protozoa as well the focus would be on treating the bacteria because it 's the main risk in terms of contamination you can actually treat the bacterial risk as well yeah yeah activates the bacteria clean air chance we will actually end up exceeding the required Frankie water standards now I know there 's still further work to come and we know you know but in a measurable way is there a chance we could actually exceed within 12 months or beyond programs completely yeah the programs that long yeah I know but with baby the current yeah so I mean we already exceed the yeah for example which is good yeah the standards in the stands for our new wells in for the wellhead remediation that we don 't raise them above ground go are more than it 's the minimum required and the drinking water standards that places us in a bit position and the future one of the one of the things that we 're doing in terms of looking at the option is for the pump stations is that we want to take a no regrets approach okay so we want to take a best practice approach and ensure that we 're getting best value for money and positioning ourselves for the future which when a new regulatory regime regime comes in it 's more likely to be stricter than the current standards so we are definitely taking a best practice approach where that is cost-effective there yeah so a capital Helen and my second one will lead on from where you just finished but my first one is around a question I 've been asked from the public a few times this week and that is around the story that well hits can you clarify that in black and white well here operating wells across the city while the below ground well hits and the focus of most of our remediation work we 've also done works on the above ground workers so the above ground well heads needed further ceiling work to ensure that they met the standards for security so the way that the way that the the standards and the criteria are being assessed post headlock north is much stricter than the way that they were being assessed prior to the headlock north so our above-ground well heads have also had some work done so we 've done we 're to bring 11 of those up to standard and we 've also done works on the below ground well heads to improve the security of those well they don 't meet the standards required to be signed off as secure and there 's definitely people working on them all the time for making better on a daily basis it 's great ok just needed to clarify that because it was a weird story but it was out you mentioned that there may be a change in standards or a new regulation come through obviously that 's from the 53 recommendations that have gone to government post here block north if the government picks those up do we have a date around that at this point announcement in October or November but I doubt that 'll be the regulatory framework or even the institution 's it will simply be an announcement off the whip that they 've done to date on the options in signaling through the week so there 's a lot of work to be done because there 's the Department of Internal Affairs review of the delivery of three water services as well as the Ministry of Health 's response to so then my follow-on question to that and this is one where I get asked from public because we didn 't have any time lying around there is you 've just stated will the public get a say and so my question near a little bit loaded I suppose would be that would there be the option for the public to say look we the government 's going to say look all water across New Zealand will be chlorinated because that means we can guarantee almost guarantee now and get sick but there 's a lower level where it 's not but as we know crisis no one had got sick in Christchurch and in our history we 'd had a pretty good program if we get our program up the pro would the public get that option or would that not be on the table discussion and you 'll be aware that around the country there are communities that are talking to their councils and voting on issues of chlorination and what they want out of their water supply so I think that public voice will come through very strongly and local government New Zealand and individual councils will contribute to lead certainly this council will contribute to that discussion which the men would lead to to the to the meal would be would we look to do some sort of major consultation with our public so we have a platform of where we stand as a council it would certainly be something the the confidence of being able to well yeah but but to say you know we might have lost our secure status but we 've taken these actions and as a result even though we haven 't got to the to the standards that might be applied in the future we want to take the chlorine out now I think that council will be in a position with advice to be able to make that decision but then for the for the longer term works I think we should go out and have a public consultation because that will be a significant financial contribution to the cost that will be required from our ratepayers and I think they have a right to have a say over that cost so I think at that point we 'll be able to go out and and I think that will be a very good basis because it will send a very strong signal to central government about how strongly crushes people feel about their big water up Phil thank you for the report and all the work just going back to the what reference to one of the issues was the poor knowledge and awareness of the aquifer and contamination risks in a way that air aquifer system is quite complex but and I guess though in Tim I was checking that in terms of the risks around very aquifer as we are aware and as an old water and you 've referred to that so the focus on water how do we do we have sufficient knowledge about Erika furs to be confident around that recipe we have very good knowledge of air aquifers and we also and there is to ensure that understanding of the aquifer system is still correct post-earthquake so the earthquakes may have disrupted we 're all familiar with the change location of Springs around the city yeah I 'm particular long the port hills did so there is some checking work to be done and we 're also redoing the work on the age of the water in aquifer one where some of our wells are sourcing aquifer one it 's the shallower ok thanks Ellen so a lot of work has been done on thank you questions very good well I 'll move that we received the information do I have a seconder Pauline is there any discussion Glen thank you for this report Helen and team to me it read really well and was easy to get a grip on and to understand along with my colleagues I 'm sure our experience of situations and urgent matters that come our way as a city we find our people in part on the punt thirst for information so as much information as we can get out to Newsline I think as constantly as possible would be really useful because this isn 't straightforward there 's a lot of information it 's not as simple as an Orion map where the powers restored and we could see it from day to day today there 's more to this than than what we think so personally you know I 'm thrilled to have this report I think that we could end up in the position of leading the way over standards could be a bit premature to stay that to say that and we 've already heard that 'm looking forward to this work continuing to to roll out I also have a cynical side of me over this whole thing and whatsits not you but what 's it some behind some people 's agendas but we 'll wait and see so thank you for this report today okay anyone else Vicki I think the report is excellent thank you very much indeed for all the work that everybody 's doing I think the thing that hasn 't come across as well in the media as we would have hoped is that the work is happening and the work is going on every day and that we are totally clear on our goal of 12 months and I know it 's a huge challenge to get there and I think the way you 've outlined the options for each of these secure drinking water sets I think the thing that 's that 's confusing to the public is that they somehow have think that the council is not on the same side as them and I just want to assure anybody and everybody that as counselors we are having a long-term uncorrelated supply that is safe and good to drink and very safe for babies and for 80 year olds as well in terms of the long-term future for this council and I think you know you 're Helen high water or your your teeth and nails or whatever and I think exclusive incredibly well in terms of what this council wants it is not separate from the community and the determination to have safe secure drinking water that is uncorrelated for a very long time so thank you very much indeed for it 's going on thank you okay I 've got Yanni did you have your hand up yep Jonnie Jonnie filled Andrew in yeah others have said but just to saying I endorsed receiving this information I endorse the comment made that we need to get chlorine out of our water as soon as possible and definitely within the 12 months so thank you for the work you 're doing on that I think it 's really important that we keep communicating with the public over the steps that we 're taking on a regular briefing cancers monthly but you know I hope well I understand we will be briefing the public on a more regular basis than that which I applaud I also think one thing that you you haven 't touched on in the report that you have responded to in questions has been that we are looking at areas where people can get uncoordinated water in terms of personal supply so you know I just encourage you to keep doing that work I think you know people do want to get water that 's not chlorinated for drinking and easier we can make that for people with the systems and technology that we might have I think that that would be really a positive thing so yeah I think the key messages have been said let 's get the chlorine out of our water and keep working as far as possible to that effect yep Phil indicated look thank you very much for such a full report and like I guess certainly I 've been one counselor I think it 's come up today that the sadness really is being focused by the list and sex 3 of 14 separate pieces of work just defies that really and it makes it really clear that in fact a hell of a lot of great work is being done to rectify a situation which wasn 't really air making at all and another strength we have to following the Havelock North inquiry where there was a strong criticism of the counts or not being involved or having poor relationships with their district count with their regional council as a district council and and all that we are well ahead of that we have very good working relationships for the again but also with their medical officer a health and that 's that collaboration I think between us is governance and staff in those different bodies which which will get us through this so there 's every every sign in Helens report that in fact you know there 's all the separate disinfection options disinfection options that are here and so we will be to reduce the impact of chlorine on the net in the near future and certainly aiming within the 12 months I receiving this report today and I think there are a number of things that are really clear from the report and they 're all things that I welcome remove the chlorine from the water within 12 months it 's something that we 've always been clear about that 's reflected in the information that we 've heard today and it also reflects the resolution that we as council made earlier in the year and I think one of the key points is that there are three work streams one of which is the significant remediation of the whale heads but the two other work streams that perhaps haven 't perhaps seen so much attention the opportunity for alternative disinfection so using UV and ozone in situations where that might be appropriate and also the ability to isolate some of the below ground well heads so it means that the whole program of upgrading the whale heads and bring them off gret above-ground whilst it 's ongoing does not need to be completed within the 12 months in order to get the chlorine out of the water within the 12 months very different matter than upgrading all of the well heads within that 12 month period the ability to turn some of the well heads off and I appreciate there 's a significant body of work gone on here or reading is a key part of the solution and of course the amount of water that the city needs to be supplied with becomes a big part of that consideration as well because once we once we know the amount of water the city needs once that 's defined we can then determine how many well heads need to be switched on in order to to deliver that where there 's the opportunity opportunity to turn off whale heads where there 's a need for chlorination that obviously allows us to reduce the amount of chlorine in the supply and in the end remove the chlorine from the supply earlier than we would be able to if we needed to have all of the whale heads turned on at all times and I like the suggestion that there 's an opportunity for the community to be part of the solution here increased demands over the summer period as opposed to the relatively low demands that we have over the winter period so this remains a big project but I think it 's clear that we 're treating this with the utmost importance and the utmost priority I also welcome the work that 's been done to increase the contact time so that we 've got less noticeable chlorine in the water that comes out of the tap and comes out of the shower and my own experience of that has been a positive one so I 'm hoping that that 's reflected across the city I welcome the regular reporting commitment and I also want to join the other voices that have acknowledged the work that 's been done to date a significant amount of work and Helen I think your appointment to the new role also shows the seriousness seriousness that the organization is giving to this particular issue the water conservation campaign certainly is one way that residents can help us get the chlorine out of the water sooner and I look forward to some early publicity around there we can make the announcement that we 've achieved what we 're setting out to do and the chlorine is actually no longer in our water supply that goes back to the pristine natural water that we all have come to expect and continue to expect in the future in ending Jimmy thank you for the work you 've done I ever have hopefully this will dispel many of those fears that people have here Duran chlorination and this has been a very painful time in our city 's life and we I doubt whether we will ever take a beautiful water for granted again so we are a city of opportunity and we are determined to use this opportunity to provide a safe secure chlorine free water supply for our future generations will enable this to be the case so that day every day arian asked me well first update status was update status we got into the coordinated water Saito so today I 'm very happy you know we can get a more kind of comprehensive information from the start and also congratulations hey don 't know I of this water drinking water in the water supply less where we were crucial because as erect member as a council we we standing everything the from the line my understand even I wish this last week in the temple area one arrest in particular he installed and modernize the future future say there is another corrilesa kind of the coordinator water pipe articulate total you know any problem every day I 'm still you know during the day water coordinator because they small safe but he didn 't like those the smell particularly the kind of a taste residual so congratulation s very good but I do hope next because you prefer mention well we send her to the council in a monthly basis are to hope next time you know particularly regarding the trench one or even change two or twenty three but here in lost uncoordinated we 're head or pump station has been ready we 're about more clear then particular you had mentioned consider you know it 's a repo our case for those that are pump station where hate and also for those that campaign you 've never kind of a time from time table you know make the people aware all well now we have before advertised even we have water conservation campaign however is not is we still have the kind of you know update and pollinated the pump station where he has been ready so you don 't need to tolerate the lost of the coalition of what my okay Erin and in pooling yeah hello no I congratulate you on giving the role because I 'm perfect congratulations of commiserations are an order for having to take on such a tough role but thank you for doing the week crash ditch his I believe that the best water in the world currently not the best drinking water in the world cuz it tastes like a swimming pool but it has the best water underneath us and the tomb disinfectant then added to our water I find quite offensive and never thought I would have heard it but we 're here now and I take they have a lot north situation is really a warning shot across the bow to any may get a transgression that can cause serious harm we had it confirmed by the medical officer of health but no one have got sick or or or sick enough from Christchurch water in the past that we know that we have a really good supply there we know our infrastructure in the past had been obviously in a bit no one got sick we couldn 't really guarantee that going forward so let 's take that warning shot we move on and we make our infrastructure to a level there means that we no longer have to use the D word and disinfect it it but my main bit of confidence from today is the Mears guaranteed that the public will get us a and our water going forward now whether were hamstrung by the government or not at least the public would have had a say and get to put a flag in the sand and say look this is how we want to govern our water this is how we want to have a say in our water and this is the water we want to drink today is that we will let them ever say and their drinking water and what they put into their bodies going forward keep Pauline you look most of its things said and I agree with everything that everybody 's seeding I think one of the the opportunities that we 've had is to take the learnings out of have locked north and in that way we 've been lucky because we although have had no transgressions we realized that there is some upgrading that we can do and we 're really happy to do that but the upside we know that we have really good knowledge and awareness of our aquifers we know about contamination risks and when they come from and what to do about it we have really good care a standard of care for our public drinking water supply and we have a really really good water safety plan so we also have excellent testing ratings over and above what 's required was a 24 hour turnaround and this is something that we should be really really proud of and now that the N is a point sorry I don 't you better Thor [Laughter] and this demonstrates through the the dedication of this whole council is being seen to return Christchurch water vegetable we did that we could hold out you know we 'll be proud of them read about throughout the world okay I just I 'll just wind this up then I spoke to a journalist recently about this issue and he said to me that he thought I 'd made the wrong call to support temporary chlorination he thought we should have let the medical officer about health make the call and to instruct us to chlorinate the water instead because then it would have been the medical officer of health who made the decision I believe that my judgment to lead the debate on chlorinating the water temporarily was the right call to make because if we lift it to the medical officer of health it wouldn 't have been a temporary decision it wouldn 't have been a decision to temporarily chlorinate the water it would have been a decision to chlorinate the water until the standard was met and if and the process then that would have been the right decision to make so voting against chlorinating the water actually would have meant the medical officer of health would have made a decision to chlorinate the water and that would not have been on a temporary basis it would have been when the time was right to lift it do you think as counselors that that would have put sufficient pressure on the organization and I do apologize to the organization would that have put sufficient pressure on the organization to come up with a range of strategies that would enable the chlorine to be removed from the water while a longer-term program of action was undertaken does anyone seriously around this table think that the organization would have been under pressure to find alternative solutions to bringing all our well heads above ground I don 't think it would have been enough and I don 't mean that in a disrespectful way it 's the only way their governance can signal to the organization who are responsible for the management of these decisions it was the only way that stay in control of this decision so I think we have set the organization a challenging timeframe but in the medical officer of Health would not have done that and I think from today 's report and I 'm very grateful for today 's report because what it has done for me as identified just the extent of the complexity that sits around this whole area and the fact that there are multiple streams of work there 's the stream of work around ending the chlorine there 's a stream of work that is around the sufficiency of the security in order to meet the present drinking water standard there is a measure of the longer-term objectives we had already started down the track long time before Havelock North we 'd already made the decision there all future well heads would be above ground so already made that decision there 's no question that the standards even around them have changed Havelock north and we 're having to relook at some of those in order to meet the sign-off standard of the of the engineers and then there 's the depending on what happens and Aaron 's articulated that through his questions that central government has already put in the arena what their intentions are in terms of the direction around the future delivery of three waters but they haven 't yet indicated the strength of the decision that they may have already made in relation to the drinking water standards and how that will be regulated in the future so we 're in a period of uncertainty in that regard but I want us as a city to be ahead of the curve and that 's because I do believe in our water supply I do believe in our confined aquifer system and I do believe that we 've got the best water in the world and we want to be able to deliver it to residents homes in a way that we 've been able to in the past at the beginning of the process so in January this year when I took a risk in terms of leading the decision on on temporary chlorination when I took that decision I didn 't know what we could do first objective of removing the chlorine and this report tells us that it 's challenging but it also tells me that staff are pulling out all stops to achieve it and that 's why I think this report is so good and should give the public the confidence that they 're looking for staff have to report to accounts or to get permission to extend the chlorination beyond 12 months we 're sending a pretty strong message today that we ain 't giving that permission so that means that we 've got to find a way between now and in order to provide that level of reassurance that we are going to be required to give in order to make that decision and make it based on the work that 's been done so the monthly reporting the wider circulation of information to the public I think that the public reaction to the chlorination it 's so different from the chlorination that was in our water after the earthquakes so different and I think that 's because everyone understood why we were chlorinating the water after the earthquakes it was why we 're chlorinating our water now and it 's because we lost our secure water status we 've got to get skilled water status back but we don 't have to do everything before we get to that point so thank you very much to the staff and it 's not just you Helen in your new role but the whole team Bridget everyone 's sitting on behind that are out there doing the word and making sure that our water supply is safe and good to drink thank you very much I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much right I 've got another resolution to include an additional report on recycling options be received and considered at the council meeting on Thursday the 14th of June which today do I have a seconder for that Andrew I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and I 'll now move that we the resolution to exclude the public and that Paul Monroe chief executive the items on the agenda that that relates to and that Craig Danny remain after public have been excluded for item 13 so and that the resolution sorry Jonnie nine separately just have my oh okay alright so do I have a seconder Andrew okay oh I 'll put nine all those in favor say aye those opposed say no no no no sorry what what what that the voters as do we include the proposed extension of the council 's living wage policy to council controlled organization and council contractors are we going to discuss that MPX or are we going to discuss it and public so at the moment I 've moved a resolution to include it in px so I 've put it up as a motion and so far two people have voted against it so I 'm going to declare that carried so three people so Aaron voted against it as well and Sara voted against it it 's anyone else would like to vote against it well good I was surprised one to my Davidson do get more I 'm I put a resolution was just asked to put it aside on a secretly recorded vote against resolution nine item nine so that 's carried and I 'll put the resolution remaining resolutions all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you so we are now and Peaks and the team that the bet can let us know when you _"

    "text": "very much and now we will move on to the what 's called the wellheads an improvement report and I 'd like to invite how Environment Program Manager water supply to come to the table and just before I welcome Helen to speak to what is her first report and her new role as the program manager for water supply and improvement I just want to quickly remind people how we have got to where we 've got to and just to remind people that on the last working day before Christmas the drinking water Assessor withdrew our provisionally secured status due to the lack of security that was found to be the case around our our water heads as a council we made the decision to temporarily chlorinate the water we gave staff authority to do so forth for 12 months on the basis that during that period of time we would be able to come up with a strategy to remove the chlorination and reinstate or fast-track the progress that we were already making on bringing our well heads up to a modern standard above ground of course track a long time ago after the earthquakes it was decided not to continue to put well heads below ground it was decided to bring them above ground and that program of work had already started which which has put us in a better position than we would have been in had that approach not been adopted the medical officer of Health sat at the end of the table and told us that if we did not make the decision to temporarily chlorinate our water he had a requisition already written that would have required the council to chlorinate and we decided as a council to take responsibility for making that decision temporarily for 12 months in order to give staff the opportunity to come up with a project of work which would enable us to go back to our supply being unclear inators and and so the work has been you know sort of fast-tracked since then and significant progress is being made but I just want to kind of reiterate because I think that there 's been a misconception out there that we have to bring all of chlorination free status restored that is not the case we do not have to complete all of that work before we take the chlorine out of the water and so I just wanted to reiterate a comment that I 've made on more than one occasion and that is there I will fight tooth and nail to have uncoordinated water as I know there every other person around this table feels just as strongly about it this isn 't a competition for how strongly people feel about it we 're all Christchurch residents we all know that this is part of who we are as a city and we have all looked at the head lock North situation and we know it 's not our story and Havelock North the source of the contamination was most likely the pond that Ben was able to lead to the borer which was part of a unconfined aquifer an aquifer they thought was confined it wasn 't we are talking about our confined aquifers and it is a completely different system they said it was unlikely that the source of the contamination was paper makes this point that they didn 't have a good system of monitoring their water safety plan wasn 't up to scratch all of the things that we do and can rely on because our staff have actually created a program of excellence around the delivery of our water our pristine water from our confined aquifers to our to our to those of our residents we have we have we 're able to rely on that so the situation is quite different from from have lot north but I don 't regret the decision that we made because we need to have our medical officer of Health on-site we do need to work with the variety of regulators that are in this field and we do need to provide confidence to central government that we are capable of making the right decisions for our community in terms of the water so I just want to come hell or high water commit to this 12 months no pressure over ta the goal of the program is to ensure that our water suppliers both safe and which drink so that means stations and progressively removing that chlorine so you have acknowledged that there has been considerable debate about whether or not we can achieve this within the 12-month period that does remain the target however Challenge so as you 've as you 've noted we will not have brought all of our below ground well heads above ground and that 12-month period we 're not able to do that but there are two other options in terms of getting secure status for a promise station one is we could use alternative disinfection so we are exploring ultraviolet radiation and ozone treatment and the other is that we could isolate where we have a single below ground wellhead and a majority of above-ground well heads we can isolate the blow ground wellhead and deliver the water just from the above-ground well heads in some cases so success depends and part on the resources we can bring to the program and accelerate the work program and it depends in part on the people of Christchurch cooperating with us in a probable water conservation program so in order to be able to deliver water and carry out the repairs we have to take a number of wells offline now in Christchurch our winter demand is approximately half of our Sodom and so if we can hold the demand closer to winter levels then summer levels right throughout the year we have a much greater chance of delivering this program so we will be talking about a water conservation program the other thing that the paper touches on is the physical works that have been carried out and here the team have been quite modest about what has already been done so as you know there are four pump stations where we are not coronating and those 11 well heads have been signed Engineers is secure and those pump stations will be favored in the future so we 're we are not chlorinating we will favor the use of those pump stations and maximize the water that we can put out into the network fries we 've also made improvements to below ground well heads across the whole of the city so we are where the risks has been pointed out where the greater risks well they haven 't been brought up to the standard where they can be signed off as secure they are better than they were we 've also explored the reduction of the initial chlorine dose and the effectiveness of chlorine in terms of a disinfectant is about both the dose in the time of contact before someone takes a glass of water to drink so where we 've got a longer contact time we can reduce that initial dose and there 's some work being done around the city to do that the other work that 's been done and I think people will have seen it around the city is that we are flushing pipes where we 're getting taste and odor complaints and it would appear at least from statistics that we 're keeping on complaints about taste and odor that that has been effective so there are reducing taste and odor complaints around the city it may also be that the chlorination is slowly moving its way through the organic matter in the system so that may be reducing anyway but the flushing can only help so paper for you to note particularly is the first tranche of works for those seven pump stations and that 's essentially where we can get quick ones so two of those pump stations the work is out to tender and for five of them the design work is just being completed we won 't know the timeframe for when we can deliver there until we get the tenders begun but we 'll certainly provide updates to that once those four pump stations once those perhaps sessions come online with the other four that will supply about a quarter of the across the city with an agent water so we 're continuing to investigate the options for the other 42 pump stations and well we have a pretty good idea of where we want to go we 're still exploring all of those options and making sure we take the best approach for each of them and what we 're proposing is a regular monthly report on progress both with the physical works and with the options for those future pump stations I 'm here to take questions thank you very a number of pressure zones that seemed to is it possible to do a lot of work in one pressure zone and then isolate that from there from the rest and have absolute Lorene free status there or do you still need to have some connectivity to rely on pressure or flow across the city bridgett O 'Brien in to answer that one because it 's a technical question that is beyond my knowledge of the system morning yeah winter demand is about half summer demand so what we could do is zone by zone as fix enough of the pump stations to supply winter demand which may be more equitable approach than fixing all of the pump station some of which are only needed for a few days each summer and so fixing it across the city to me remove all those combination the work Pope when you consider prioritize all those work a pump station as well as the water conservation or campaign initiate will will be do this water conservation where she not campaign initiative with so the water conservation campaign is probably not necessarily during the warms up through the summer so a lot of the summer demand of course is people watering Gardens in moons so you mean they 're less after the six months almost 21 or some other the where he accomplished in all all theory under control in air after six months away is the widow warms up okay thank you I 'm Paulina minyan II he think he actually suggest you putting that time forward because I think personally mulching your dad and there 's the best thing you can do to save water and if people are planting new gardeners from you know possibly August maybe one of the messages but my question is actually on page 10 you say you 've received the device on European best practice for unclear native water supplies what is it I mean it 's gonna be big what does it look like is it you so we 've got a draft report on the approaches in Europe where they have major urban supplies that I 'm not being coordinated but we haven 't fully assisted and honey thank you for the update and map online but there 's not if you click on the little blue things that come up there 's really no information about what 's being done have we got a process underway to sort of put a little bit more information about you know the number of well hits that are above or below ground the tranche that they 're in what 's being looked at is there any way that we can just I guess for people in local areas who have it you know individual concern over the pump station or the well it 's sort of in their local area that they can get a sense of what 's been done so the Met the Met that 's gone up you 're right his rudimentary information at the moment and we are continuing to work on it and we 'll be providing more information the second question I had was in regards to that the ozone and the UV treatment and the beaker report that came out to government they they make the comment that that from 2009 onwards national baseline monitoring has shown the risks reticular groundwater sources it talks about the outbreak at have lot North being of bacterial origin and that the argument should be that you know water supplies should focus more on bacterial compliance rather than protozoal because the bulk of the upgrading cost is asserted with UV treatment so you just kind of help me at a high level understand how we 're weighing that that kind of overstated aspects of the protis our risk versus what we 're doing intend to look at quite a zone and UV um Ministry of Health and crisis accounts I 've been measuring protozoa said Ministry of Health across the country and they 've never found a single protozoa in any groundwater supply including including Christchurch so the thinking is that the drinking water standards are too conservative in terms of the risk of protozoa for groundwater supplies but it still but they 're still the drinking water standards haven 't_''_974.24 been changed to reflect that so that may come in a future of vision but in the meantime we still have to try and comply with the current ones the UV is would treat protozoa as well the focus would be on treating the bacteria because it 's the main risk in terms of contamination that UV can actually treat the bacterial risk as well yeah yeah and activates the bacteria clean air chance we will actually end up exceeding the required Franken water standards now I know there 's still further work to come and we know you know but in a measurable way is there a chance we could actually exceed within 12 months or beyond programs completely yeah the programs that long time yeah I know but this with various current yeah sorry I mean we already exceed the drinking water standards in terms of how frequently we monitor yeah he called I for example and which is good yeah the standards in the students for our new wells in for the wellhead remediation that we don 't really raise them above ground go are more than it 's the minimum required and the drinking water standards that places us in a bit position in the future one of the one of the things that we 're doing in is that we want to take a no regrets approach okay so we want to take a best practice approach and ensure that we 're getting best value for money and positioning ourselves for the future which when a new regulatory regime regime comes in it 's more likely to be stricter than the current standards so we are definitely taking a best practice approach where that is cost-effective err yeah so a couple Helen and my second one will lead on from where you just finished but my first one is around a question I 've been asked from the public a few times this week and that is around the story that rain that we had not done any work on the well hits can you clarify that in black and white so well here operating whirls across the city well the below ground well heads are the focus of most of our remediation work we 've also done works on the above ground workers so the above ground well heads needed further ceiling work to ensure that they met the standards for security so the way that being assessed post Havelock North is much stricter than the way that they were being assessed prior to a lot north so our above-ground well heads have also had some work done so we 've done we 're to bring eleven of those up to standard and we 've also done works on the below ground well heads to improve the security of those well they don 't meet the standards required to be signed off as secure they have and there 's definitely people working on them all the time to make them better on a daily basis it 's great I can 't just needed to clarify that because it was a weird story but it was out near and the other one is a follow-on from you you mentioned that there may be a change in standards or a new regulations come through obviously that 's from the 53 recommendations that have gone to government post here block North if the government picks those up do we have a date around that at this point they may have another announcement in October or November but I doubt 's it will simply be an announcement of the work that they 've done to date on the options in signaling through the week so there 's a lot there 's a lot of work to be done because there 's the Department of Internal Affairs review of the delivery of three water services as well as the Ministry of Health 's response to headlock so then my follow-on question to that and this is one where I get asked from public because we didn 't have any time lying around there is you 've just stated will the public get a say and so in my question near a little bit loaded I suppose would be that would there be the option for the public to say look we would rather take a risk and not have chlorine if the government 's gonna say look all water across New Zealand will be chlorinated because that means we can guarantee almost guarantee no one gets sick but there 's a lower level where it 's not but as we know Christchurch no one had got sick in Christchurch and in get our program up the pro would the public get that option or would that not be on the table discussion and you 'll be aware that around the country there are communities that are talking to their councils and voting on issues of chlorination and what they want out of their water supply so I think that public voice will come through very strongly and local government New Zealand and individual councils will contribute to that certainly this council will contribute to that discussion my question then would be to to the to the mirror would be would we look to do some sort of major consultation with our public so we have a platform of where we stand as a council it would certainly be something that I would favour but I want us to have the the confidence of being able to vote yeah but but to say you know we might have lost our secure status but we 've taken these actions and as a result even though we haven 't got to to the standards that might be applied in the future we want to be in a position with advice to be able to make that decision but then for the for the longer term works I think we should go out and have a public consultation because that will be a significant financial contribution to the cost that will be required from our ratepayers and I think they have a right to have a say over their costs so I think at that point we 'll be able to go out and and I think that will be a very good basis because it will send a very strong signal to central government about how strongly crushes people feel about their big water up Phil thank you for the report and all the work it 's on it just going back to the what happened at Havelock North and I think 513 has got reference to one of the issues was the poor knowledge and awareness of the aquifer in contamination risks in a way that air aquifer system is quite complex and I guess though and Tim was checking that in terms of the risks around very aquifer as we 're aware no no so the focus on whichever how do we do we have sufficient knowledge about Erica firs to be confident around it we have very good knowledge of areas and we also and then it 's to ensure that understanding of the aquifer system is still correct post-earthquake so the earthquakes may have disrupted aquifers underground we 're all familiar with the change you know location of Springs around the city yeah our particular Port Hills it so there is some checking work to be done and we 're also redoing the work on the edge of the water in aquifer one where some of our wells are sourcing equal for one city so it 's the shower right thanks Ellen so a lot of work has been done on thank you yeah and we 're continuing that work is any other questions pretty good well I 'll move that we received the information do I have a seconder Pauline is there any discussion Glen thank you for this report hello nineteen to me it read really well and was easy to get a grip on and to understand situations and urgent matters that come our way as a city we find our people in part on the punt thirst for information so as much information as we can get out to Newsline I think as constantly as possible would be really useful because this isn 't straightforward there 's a lot of information it 's not as simple as an Orion map where the powers restored or we could see it from day to day today there 's more to this than than what we think so first thing you know I 'm thrilled to have this report I think that we could end up in the position of leading the way over standards could be a bit premature to stay that to say that and we 've already heard that in some ways actually we did we do so I 'm looking forward to this work continuing to to roll out I also have a cynical side of me over this whole thing and what 's it 's not not you but what 's its some behind some people 's agendas but we 'll wait and see anyone else Vicki I think the report is excellent thank you very much indeed for all the work that everybody 's doing I think the thing that hasn 't come across as well in the media as we would have hoped is that the work is happening and the work is going on every day and that we are totally clear on our goal of 12 months and I know it 's a huge challenge to get there and I think the way you 've outlined the options for each of these secure drinking water sets I think the thing that 's that 's confusing to the public is that they somehow have think that the council is not on the same side as them and I just want to assure anybody and everybody that as counselors we are unanimous about getting the chlorine out of the water and having a long-term uncorrelated supply that is safe and good to drink and very safe for babies and for 80 year olds as well in terms of the long-term future for this council and I think you know your hell and what this council wants it is not separate from the community and the determination to have safe secure drinking water for a very long time so thank you very much thank you okay I 've got Jonnie did you have your hand up yep Jonnie Jonnie filled Andrew in yeah others have said but just to say I endorsed receiving this information I endorse the comment made that we need to get chlorine out of our water as soon as possible and definitely within the 12 months so thank you for the work you 're doing on that I think it 's really important that we keep communicating with the public over the steps that we 're taking on a regular basis and I know on the report you talk about briefing counselors monthly but you know I hope well I understand we will be briefing the public on a more regular basis than that which I applaud I also think one thing that you you haven 't touched on in the report that you have responded to in questions has been that we are looking at areas where people you know I just encourage you to keep doing that work I think you know people do want to get water that 's not chlorinated for drinking and easier we can make that for people with the systems and technology that we might have I think that that would be really a positive thing so yeah I think the key messages have been said let 's get the chlorine out of our water and keep working as far as possible to that effect yep Phil indicated look thank you very much for such a full report and like I guess certainly I 've been one counselor I think it 's come up today that the sadness really is greener focused by the meteor on the failures and in fact you know the list and sex 3 of 14 separate pieces of work just defies that really and it makes it really clear that in fact a hell of a lot of great work is being done to rectify a situation which wasn 't really air making at all and another strength we have to following the Havelock North inquiry where being involved or having poor relationships with their district count with their Regional Council as a district council and and all that we are well ahead of that we have very good working relationships for the again but also with their medical officer a health and that 's that collaboration I think between us and governance and staff in those different bodies which which will get us through this so there 's every every sign in Helens report that in fact you know this group is all the separate disinfection options disinfection options that are here and so we will be to reduce the impact of chlorine on the net in the near future and certainly aiming within the 12 months I 'm Andrew thank you I 'm really pleased to be receiving this report today and I think there are a number of things that are really clear from the report and they 're all things that I welcome Laurene from the water within 12 months is something that we 've always been clear about that 's reflected in the information that we 've heard today and it also the year and I think one of the key points is that there are three work streams one of which is the significant remediation of the whale heads but the two other work streams that perhaps haven 't perhaps seen so much attention the opportunity for alternative disinfection so using UV and ozone in situations where that might be appropriate and also the ability to isolate some of the below ground wellheads so it means that the whole program of upgrading the whale heads and bring them of gret above ground whilst it 's ongoing does not need to be completed within the 12 months in order to get the chlorine out of the water within the 12 months getting the chlorine out of the water is actually a very different matter than upgrading all of the well heads within that 12 month period the ability to turn some of the well heads off and I appreciate there 's a significant body of work gone on here or reading is a key part of the solution and of course the amount of water that the city needs to be supplied because once we once we know the amount of water the city needs once that 's defined we can then determine how many well heads need to be switched on in order to to deliver that where there 's the opportunity opportunity to turn off whale heads where there 's a need for chlorination that obviously allows us to reduce the amount of chlorine in the supply and in the end remove the chlorine from the supply earlier than we would be able to if we needed to have all of the whale heads turned on at all times and I like the suggestion that there 's an opportunity for the community to be part of the solution here through saving water and therefore reducing the effect of the increased demands over the summer period as opposed to the relatively low demands that we have over the winter period so this remains a big project but I think it 's clear that we 're treating this with the utmost importance and the utmost priority I also well the work that 's been done to increase the contact time so that comes out of the tap and comes out of the shower and my own experience of that has been a positive one so I 'm hoping that that 's reflected across the city I welcome to regular reporting commitments and I also want to join the other voices that have acknowledged the work that 's been done today to a significant amount of work and Helen I think your appointment to the new role also shows the seriousness seriousness that the organization is giving to this particular issue the water conservation campaign certainly is one way that residents can help us get the chlorine out of the water sooner and I look forward to some early publicity around there but the thing I 'm most look forward to is when we can make the announcement that we 've achieved what we 're setting out to do and the chlorine is actually no longer in our water supply that goes back to the pristine natural water that we all have come to expect and continue to expect in the future [Music] nation and this has been a very painful time and a beautiful water for granted again so we are a city of opportunity and we are determined to use this opportunity to provide a safe secure chlorine free water supply for our future generations the work that we 're doing today we 're doing today will enable this to be the case so before that day Jimmy over the last several months looks like every day I faced another residence my Aryan asked me what first update status was update status regarding to the coordinator water etc so today I 'm very happy you know we can get a more kind of comprehensive information from the start and also congratulations hey don 't know I 've been appointed as a program manager for the improvement of this water drinking water in the water supply less where we were crucial because as elected member as a council we we standing everything the founder line my understand even I wish this last week in the temple area one arrest in particular Tommy lately he installed kind of modernize the future future say there is a kind of the coordinated water pipe articulate you know during the tailwater coordinator because there 's more safer but he didn 't like those the smell particularly the kind of a taste a seizure so congratulation s very important but I do hope next time because you prefer mention well presented to the council in a monthly basis are to hope next time you know particularly regarding the trench one or even change two or twenty three but here in lost uncoordinated where hate or calm station has been ready we 're about more clear then particular you had mentioned consider you know is the repo our ties for those that are pump station where hate and also for the are those that are the campaign you put your water conservation the water campaign you 've never kind of a transient and table no make the people aware all well now we have people advertise even we have water conservation however is not is we we still have had a few you know update and pollinated the pump station where he has been ready so you don 't need to tolerate the lost of the coal nation yeah hello no I congratulate you on getting the role because I 'm perfect congratulations or commiserations or an order for having to take on such a tough role but thank you for doing the week crush ditch has I believe that the best water in the world currently not the best drinking water in the world cuz it tastes like a swimming pool but it has the best water underneath us and the tomb disinfectant then added to our water I find quite offensive and never thought I would have heard it but we 're here now and I take they have a lot north situation is really a warning shot across the bow to any council that if your infrastructure is not in line you may get a transgression that can cause serious harm we had it confirmed by the medical officer of health that no one have got sick or or or sick enough from Christchurch water in the past that we know that we have a really good supply there we know our infrastructure in the past had been of a standard that no one got let 's take that warning shot we move on and we make our infrastructure to a level that means that we no longer have to use the D word and disinfect it it but my main bit of confidence from today is the Mears guaranteed that the public will get us say and our water going forward now whether were hamstrung by the government or not at least the public would have had a say and get to put a flag in the sand and say look this is how we want to govern our water this is how we want to have a say in our water and this is the water we want to drink and for me that is probably the best message of today is that we will let them ever say and via drinking water and what they put into their bodies going forward keep Pauline you look most of it 's being said and I agree with everything that everybody 's sitting I think one of the the opportunities that we 've had is to take the learnings out of Havelock north and in had no transgressions we realized that there is some upgrading that we can do and we 're really happy to do that but the upside we know that we have really good knowledge and awareness of our aquifers we know about contamination risks and when they come from and what to do about it we have really good care a standard of care for our public drinking water supply and we have a really really good water safety plan so we also have excellent testing regimes over and above what 's required was 24-hour turnaround and I 'm this something that we should be really really proud of and now that LeAnn has a point of view Helen is our program manager demonstrating sorry I don 't and this demonstrates through the the dedication of this whole council has been seen to return Christchurch water vegetable weekend that we could hold out you know to be proud of them great about throughout the world so this is a good day Thank You Colleen thank you is there anyone oh okay I 'll just I 'll just wind this up then he said to me that he thought I 'd made the wrong call to support temporary chlorination he thought we should have let the medical officer about health make the call and to instruct us to chlorinate the water instead because then it would have been the medical officer of Health who made the decision I believe that my judgment to lead the debate on chlorinating the water temporarily was the right call to make because if we lift it to the medical officer of health it wouldn 't have been a temporary decision it wouldn 't have been a decision to temporarily chlorinate the water it would have been a decision to chlorinate the water until the standard was met and if counselors had wanted to give up control of another stage in the process then that would have been the right decision to make so voting against chlorinating the water actually would have meant the medical officer of health would have made a decision to chlorinate the water and that would not have been on a temporary basis it would have been when the time was right to have put sufficient pressure on the organization and I do apologise to the organization would that have put sufficient pressure on the organization to come up with a range of strategies that would enable the chlorine to be removed from the water while a longer-term programme of action was undertaken does anyone seriously around this table thing that the organization would have been under pressure to find alternative solutions to bringing all our well heads above ground I don 't think it would have been enough and I don 't mean that in a disrespectful way it 's the only way that governance can signal to the organization who are responsible for the management of these decisions it was the only way that we could signal how important it was for us to stay in control of this decision so I think we have set the organization a challenging time frame but in the medical officer of Health would not have done that and I think from today 's report and I 'm very grateful for today 's report because what it has done for me as identified just the and the fact that there are multiple streams of work there 's the stream of work around ending the chlorine there 's a stream of work that is around the sufficiency of the security in order to meet the present drinking water standard there is a measure of the longer term objectives we had already started down the track long time before Havelock North we had already made the decision there all future well heads would be above ground so we 've already made that decision there 's no question that the standards even around them have changed since Havelock north and we 're having to relook at some of those in order to meet the sign-off standard of the of the engineers and then there 's the longer-term stream of work or it might be shorter term depending on what happens and Erin 's articulated that through his questions that central government has already put in the arena what their intentions are in terms of the direction around the future delivery of three waters but they haven 't yet indicated the strength of the decision that they may have how that will be regulated in the future so we 're in a period of uncertainty in that regard but I want us as a city to be ahead of the curve and that 's because I do believe in our water supply I do believe in our confined aquifer system and I do believe that we 've got the best water in the world and we want to be able to deliver it to our residents homes in a way that we 've been able to in the past at the beginning of the process so in January this year when I took a risk in terms of leading the decision on on temporary chlorination when I took that decision I didn 't know what we could do to achieve the first obligation of removing the or the first objective of removing the chlorine and this report tells us that it 's challenging but it also tells me that staff are pulling out all stops to achieve it and that 's why I think this report is so good and should give the public the confidence that they 're get permission to extend the chlorination beyond 12 months we 're sending a pretty strong message today that we ain 't giving that permission so that means that we 've got to find a way between now and being in order to provide that level of reassurance that we are going to be required to give in order to make that decision and make it based on the work that 's been done so the monthly reporting the wider circulation of information to the public I think that the public reaction to the chlorination it 's so different from the chlorination that was in our water after the earthquakes so different and I think that 's because everyone understood why we were chlorinating the water after the earthquakes it was a given everyone accepted it but people don 't understand why we 're chlorinating our water now and it 's because we lost our secure water status we 've got to get secure water status back but we don 't have to do everything before we get to that point so thank you very much to the staff and it the whole team Bridget everyone 's sitting on behind that are out there doing the work and making sure that our water supply is safe and good to drink okay thank you very much I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye all those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much right I 've got another resolution to include an additional report on recycling options be received and considered at the council meeting on Thursday the 14th of June which today do I have a seconder for that Andrew I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried [Music] _"

    "text": "moved to finance and performance committee our performance reporting for April 2018 and I 'll hand over to Andrew as he was the chair of the report but just to note that we 're not dealing with the entire report we 're just dealing with the items that the committee wanted reported to this meeting prior to the conclusion of the financial year Andrew yes so the whole report as has been said will come through with the with the minutes of the the meeting in the normal way but there were a number of things that came up in the discussion about the report which we felt were appropriate to have reported to this meeting given that this is the less Council meeting prior to consideration of the LTP and we were certainly keen to pick up any things that that could inform that discussion or that we might want to do work on before we lock the final LTP down so the registered food premises once a year there have been some changes to the regulatory environment that mean that we we needed to consider changing that target discussion about what happens when there is a change in the environment a change in the regulatory environment or when something happens and the current challenge is that we 've got around chlorination of the water supply would be a good example of that they have a lot of North inquiry what do we then do to trigger a change to our level of service to reflect that change in the regulatory environment or when something has happened which potentially changes the way we would look at a particular level of service so that 's what gave rise to item three in front of us today agrees that where there 's a change to the environment for example in event incidents or change to regulatory regulatory requirements in order to maintain fifth purpose levels of service service plans will be immediately reviewed by staff and proposed changes to level of service will be referred to the next meeting of the Finance and Performance Committee for commendations of the council so that means that there 's where there is that change it immediately triggers that review by staff and it immediately of Finance and performance so that we can consider on recommendation from staff who have considered this whether any change to the level of service is required and so that we can get that change to the level of service in place as soon as possible to reflect that new environment the additional staff recommendations additional information regarding the proposed changes to level of service in relation to the general service satisfaction of point of contact surveys obviously the the surveys have been reported they 're available on our website we were very keen to make sure that the results of those surveys obviously generate work which addresses some of the issues that have come up and we 've got the additional appendices to the report today which deal with some of those issues and work streams which will be underway in order for that to happen and of course Carlene has got some work underway within the organization and particularly with the ELT to make sure that there are some work programs particularly designed to address some of the issues that the point of contact survey and the resident also indicated in relation to the EAG report that we will be continuing to review levels of service on an ongoing basis probably through the committee 's after the LTP has been decided and of course the resident satisfaction survey point of contact survey and what we 've heard through the LTP submissions process will all come into play any consideration that we have of whether the current levels of service reflect the concerns of our residents and this obviously relates to to that area as well and in fact 0.5 in these recommendations note that the LT will be doing some work there and obviously picks up the surveys and the ltb feedback and then there 's additional information provided again as a further appendix to today 's report just looking at the levels of service as they relate to those areas that came up as concerns in the surveys that I 've been talking about so there are a couple of additional appendices which relate to the particular matters that we 'd requested we brought to this meeting from finance and performance outside of the normal reporting cycle pick up to inform the LTP or work that we 're saying won 't necessarily be reflected in the LTP but will be done between now and the annual plan next year or any updated LTP next year thank you I 'll just pass over to the chief executive to make some comments thank you I just want to reiterate some of the things the deputy Muir has said so the issues and levels of service we have hundreds of people 's of service we have both levels of service related to LTP and what we call non LTP levels of service which are really around management accountability levels of service they were you 've seen a lot of these previously so in the development of the long-term plan in the service plans there 's been earlier discussions around those and also workshops around specific areas in recent times around you know roads and transport and three waters so we 've had some look at those in preparation for their LTP but it doesn 't need to be a rolling process over the next three years so that we continue at one point every three years given that they 're so important I think that issue about levels of service those be quite complex and they 're often a proxy for what it is that people are actually looking for so a resident satisfaction depends on a whole range of things that depends on your level of investment in particular areas that depends on progress with changes that depends on air once the complaints and concerns that people hear and just the experience of things so it might be the experience of a service but it might be experience of you know driving down the road every day and roads are a good example so one of our lower satisfaction even pre-earthquake s-- was to do with the smoothness of roads so what people need to see post-earthquake is actually progress around things and I think I mentioned previously it seems now that residents have been in the past could see the big stuff that 's going on now they 're worried about the potholes outside of their house every time they drive drive out of their driveway so it of service I think are really important but there are other things that we need to do and that 's why we 've linked the response and the work around the residents survey and the other information that we have from the submissions in their hearings to looking at what 's the program of work that we need to understand think about the resonant survey proportion of it was around how council making makes decisions and the information around that so people understand how they can participate how they can influence decisions and what those decisions are as well as specific areas such as roads and our three waters in appearance of some of our parks and waterways so that we need to do better in terms of people 's experience in the understanding of what happens so some of the week we 'll look at excuse me how we provide you with better information to support your decision-making how we allow people to really understand that so reports not being so technical but actually being more accessible and understandable for people and engaging people earlier before decisions are made and the way we deliver services but also in the way that we communicate things so there 's quite a big piece of work that needs to happen around it but certainly I think that the hearings the submissions and things like the various residency those we do we do quite a few surveys will input into that process and will continue to feedback probably initially through finance and performance exam right any questions Yanni I 'm just in terms of the residents survey and the you know the very damning targets and the actuals around the percentage of residents feeling that they have some influence and understanding how we make decisions and feeling like they can participate it would seem to me that there 's some governance legal decisions that we need to make so it 's not just a measure for the chief executive I 'm sorry I just wanted what 's the best way of getting that addressed I mean I 'm just really concerned that these targets are not being met quite significantly lower than target and there 's a number of practices that we have not I 'm not interrupting you but as I 've explained to councillors before some of the structures that we have in place around decision making are clearly not working as well as they could and I 've already for example suggested that we shift to capital program monitoring committees that has full responsibility for the entire capital program I guess I was more interested in the sort of short-term things like we 're currently consulting on things like master road plans or we 're you know different transport projects and I 'm just really concerned that we 're still not applying anything different to those look I think I think I 'd rather wait for the analysis to come through from staff because you know I think that you can you can look at some of the results and you know through one particular lens but actually if you put a slightly different lens on it and you ask yourself the question do i as the resident of the city understand why if I ask for something to be done or the council asks for something to be consulted isn 't what I put on do I feel like I 've been able to influence so is this more than one issue and there 's more than one type of consultation and engagement one of the things that you have raised on many occasions yani as the need to move to hearings panels and and having report backs from hearings panel for decision-making or even having hearings panels delegated decision-making and I think that sort of approach is actually with you know we just had the wall stone drop-in sessions for example but I don 't know that counts all the characters are invited to to hear so the counselors are making decisions but sometimes we 're not given copies of the submissions we 're not invited to the meetings where people actually you know we are given copies of the other submissions I think that we need to have a proper discussion around the framework for the type of decision and you 've raised this on many occasions and you know I think I would like you to be happy that you have finally been heard by me some decisions about where we 're delegations could properly enable for example a community board in conjunction with maybe some accounts of what we do so we 'll be putting some work together to understand a range of things some of it will be around governance in decision-making how we can support it and then I think it 's worthwhile having a bit of a workshop your feet will just let and can I and just suggests that we just complete the LTP for that but then we can focus on that and so yeah I mean I just want to completely support though what the chief executive just said because we 've got to focus on the on the the LTP which is why this report is here now and the next step is to make sure that we build a proper governance framework that will support the organization right okay so you concerns that we 've previously identified we feed into the chief executive so that things like you know there was number of actually key learnings well if you you can do that and then we can everybody to have a discussion about how you feel it works there any other questions just I don 't know if it 's possible for the community board maybe to get briefed on the odor complaints or whether that the Eddy committee will pick it up it was really good to have that information um and I don 't want to take time today drilling into the specifics all of that but it did seem that it does raise some questions around where the complaints are coming from and what 's being done would you like that and the first instance to be with the chairs and then individual committees kind of called called the team and whatever it 's maybe better going through the local community boards as well so that the project is every community board yes but for the community board areas what where there 's a number of complaints what seems a complainer I know but the specific projects that have being done to address that complaints in those areas I just think that would be useful yep can we can we whiz the older one information and then we can think about what processes for getting more detailed information that the community refers to team projects happening in the first three years of the LTP well it doesn 't refer to what those projects are okay well we can get that information yeah yep I just wanted to make a general yeah well I 'll get a mover and a seconder for so andrew you 'd like to move that seconded by and galloway so open that up for discussion Andrew thank you just a couple of further comments on the residue satisfaction survey and the point of contact so clearly you know we 've heard from residents through these two surveys and we 've also heard from residents on a wide range of issues through the LTP engagements and and submissions process as well and it 's been really interesting sitting here listening to residents and their concerns and seeing you know patterns of concern and particularly from particular areas of the city and so line those up with what we 've heard through the surveys which have been reported in in quite a same time as we 're considering those LTP submissions but I think the key message here this morning is that we 're really gearing up to respond to the results of these surveys and what we 've heard through the LTP submissions and obviously the analysis of the survey results of the importance in that regard our first opportunity to respond will be in the decision making meetings for the LTP that start next Friday but also through the work that we 're doing reviewing those service plans systematically over the next period and and obviously that could well result in some changes to levels of service to better reflect the concerns and the aspirations of our residents and our communities so I think it 's absolutely clear that is elected members and I refer to the comments made by the chief executive this morning as well but we 're taking this is an absolute priority and I also agree with my colleague counselor Johansson that looking at governance and decision-making processes is going to be a key part of what we need to look at over the next period looking at that to see how again we can better reflect the expectations of our community in the way that we do things just to make several points um one is that we also had a quite expensive communication to review that cost 80,000 there are a number of recommendations in there which I think would be timely to revisit because I think what 's really important is that we we developed to weigh what was the data that I don 't mean to interrupt that was a pro I just wanted to make sure you 're talking about that report every one so some of us were here not just me but actually there was a number of things that actually you know in terms of building relationships with people regular meetings with two-way communication between us and and and others was quite valuable I thought but also you know I welcome the opportunity to look at how we make decisions and as it 's been said it you know have been concerned that we 've gone away from giving people having hearings where people can work through the 't divorce the delegations the delegations issue because when things get delegated to either a committee and there 's no local representation or people don 't feel that they 're locally elected people can actually make it make a decision on something then that does create an issue so looking at the community board delegations I think we we need to get on and do that you know that 's been outstanding for a long time now and the sooner we get there clarity around that then I think we can really improve how we do some of those goverment 's things there is a disconnect at the moment between things that come as part of community board recommendations to council for decisions and the information around that so I think that 's really important to review there what there was a very good liter and 2016 regarding the Rapanui cycleway with a number of learnings and I think you know it may be timely to go back and reflect on that because actually it would seem to me that there was a number of really sensible things in there applied through what we 're doing and I think you know let 's learn from what 's happened previously so we don 't repeat those mistakes um I did want to acknowledge the success of QE 2 reopening and one of the performance measures that we were failing was people going to our Rick and sports centers hopefully that one I think is no longer gonna fail given the the popularity and and the only other point I wish to make was um I think it 's really interesting looking at the water reticulation and and and the the huge issue with water water breaks along our water mains and so I think we really do need to really think about that in terms of the LTP in terms of the skirt legacy what we can see quite clearly from this report is the huge impact that that 's having and that is very real in terms of risk and you know we will obviously rightfully stoke asan the chlorination issue but we also have a major issue with our water main reticulation system in the city that does need you for providing the information and in the Oder advice I think that 's really useful there 's a number of improvements there that staff have recognized and I think at a governance it would be good to have an ability to endorse those at some stage all right I shall put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried the _"

    "text": "look good good morning everyone good morning everyone if councils could take their chairs thank you thank you um before I sort of I 'm gonna formally open the meeting but I 'd like to begin by by making a statement and it 's in relation to two people who have passed away and would like to make this statement in regard to the two people and then I would like us to stand everyone for a minute 's silence and their and their memory the first is to note the passing of Graham Stanley who was a proud Christchurch native who was passionate about her city and our region 's heritage physical and natural environment he was a counselor for the Christchurch City Council 's North Ward for three terms between 1980 to 1983 1983 to 1986 in 1986 to 1989 and I knew Graham very well but I didn 't know that he 'd been a city councilor so on his passing it didn 't occur to me to to bring this to the council 's attention but I want us as a matter of policy to always the certainly what it is today while on council he became chair of the Housing Committee Deputy Chair of roadworks and traffic 's traffic and was a member of the cultural committee he was also appointed by the Christchurch City Council to lead the elect of Christchurch walks project in 1998 and received several heritage awards I went on one of those walks with him and his extraordinary knowledge but love for the city was just so apparent and everything that he did he passed away at the age of 79 years on April 19 the second does Christine Wilson at the last meeting of the peninsular Community Board a moment of silence was held in remembrance of Christine to honor her life and service to our community she was a member of the Littleton Mount Heber community board and the first chair of the bank 's modular community board the community board was one of many ways Christine served our community she was a proud little was a little tone Ian and many would say she lived to serve the community and family she started the original Littleton youth harbor Basin Youth Center and was a longtime manager and facilitator at the Littleton Community House she was a dearly loved and adored wife mother mother and law Nina auntie and great auntie Christine presented to Council on so many occasions and her role as the community board chair and she will be very much missed so if I could ask you to stand and join me in a moment silence thank you very much I have an apology from councilman Angie with someone like to move that that apology be received sorry oh sorry anyone else so in serie temp return for early departure someone like to move that mic sikandar 's by Jimmy chin I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's Harry 's declarations of interest none have been received public participation public forum deputations by appointment there are no none of those today presentation of petitions none of those today either and we have a resolution to include supplementary report being my monthly report so would someone like to move that that be accepted onto the agenda that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried now just in terms of having acknowledged Christine 's passing could I invite the Banks Peninsula community board Pam Richardson and Joan Richfield forward to come forward first thank you good morning and we 've just got by Christine and can I just say what a lovely service was held the recreation ground for us Kristine 's friends her family and learn about some of the antics of the best ship boys and the other rugby players it was an amazing occasion but it just went so smoothly and we had a fine day so yes Christine we remember you so the next one as we move on to stone cottage a tour from Brady Park now you 'll also be going to author Bradley Park to have a look at autumn Bradley it is an old farm it 's got a lot of history around it it was Reverend Bradley who originally owned it and he was a minister and decided that the farming life was a better life to have so he changed stone cottages and LeAnn you also mentioned this in your report mm-hmm so it 's one of Canterbury 's oldest buildings and it was badly damaged in the 2011 earthquakes but the amazing thing about it is the repair of it and the the number of people around it that did that free had a passion about it and did it freely and donated their time and expertise so we are very thankful that that was some that 's been done and a great celebration so do go and have a look at autumn Bradley particularly in the spring perhaps when the when the bulbs are out the rhododendrons that it 's amazing park is amazing walkways and still part of it as as a farm and there 's a lot of old farming exhibitions there as well if we move on to Omar now this is a challenging process that we 've got underway at the moment and we 're over 600 submissions to this reserve it 's one of 15 reserves that we have on banks peninsula and the reserves under the reserves that are required to have we 've got on the side of it there of which we 've got a few challenges working through it 's right behind the town it 's a mix of walking tracks and cycle tracks and there 's also a patient of planting team around it it 's a great spot close behind the town but there seems to be some end indiscriminate track work going on there so we 're just trying to resolve those issues and get down to a safe plan that where people and the cyclists and the walkers can all cordon all live and work together and get on with the job the management committee needs a little bit of guidance and we 're going through quite a lengthy process to come out with the court decision out the other end but it 's just going slowly but I think we will have the result right results shortly so then if we could move to the recreation ground now this is where the were there was two huge marquees for Christine 's funeral on the recreation ground and the amazing thing was that they fit rugby leads this was where they grew up where they played their rugby and so this is a very important part of Littleton 's recreation opportunities very important part of the community 's opportunities and as part of that navel point development area where we 're looking at a number of things that we hope will happen over the next few years in that area will be improved and it 's um it is an a mix of industrial activities and things around that area and it 's got some risks in the area but they 're being addressed and hopefully that we will come out also with that with a great recreation ground rugby field and it 's a field for many things down there and we were looking at the parking and that around that so the next one is a corral waste water well this is another ongoing cycle we seem to have a number of little sagas that are challenging us in the a Corral community we have spoken about it before and the deep well injection that 's being being explored the idea of that program that some its consent is being reviewed or has been reviewed and we need to have a consent in place but I think about 2023 so the work that 's happening on the ekor our waste water does also have an impact on the devotionals scheme as well that 's being suggested so if the waste but if the deep well injection and echo are as appropriate then it will be used and perhaps used in the devotional situation will be very helpful the way won 't meet so much land and it 'll be on council land where um where that takes place too so yes we have got a number of challenges and what 's our last one Jones that 's it so yes but I did actually just want to pull out of there out of our report the number of the number of there where we an hour deep number of deputations that were getting to our boards along to our board meetings are very well attended people are very interested in what 's going on and we provide them with every opportunity so I their time that they give to us as a board it 's extraordinary time that you give to us three help for them we 've got some great talents within our team so thank you I won 't have any questions our pen thank you that 's a excellent report Andrew would you like to move but it we received second up by Sarah I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much I didn 't see the ten minutes ticking over no but I didn 't put the timer on but you will you will within the ten minutes thank you I 'll only put the timer on if I feel that it 's necessary come Thanks sorry coastal be--would community board thank you the year we were born as a great year but I won 't divulge when we were born this is what we have for you today is no pat ace so that 's quite straightforward then we go straight to some of the things that have been next year so they 're this month looking a few things come to fruition which is very exciting and the first one that we have for you today is the fitness trail which I mentioned last month so it was officially opened at the beginning of May we had about 60 people from Darlington community come and join us to celebrate and the Darlington community cottage trust and the community board members and also council staff and other residents associations it was a fantastic day it was really cold as you can see up there with the previous slide we had two very special gentlemen cut the ribbon there they were gentlemen that time the project began once they hit the vision and they passed it on to the Darlington community center that 's Anton qur 'anic and Bill Ehlert so it was really exciting to get them to have to come and take part in that celebration there so in the staff does an amazing job putting it all together in the Darlington community oh you can skip that one but Darlington Community College trusts were the ones that have raised the money for looking at the maintenance but I must have met well there was a confession that you 've got Glen there that you went the week before and got him to your lycra and had the media sort of opportunity but on the day he came along in this good gear so you know we did have a bit alike with there but not actually on the morning but a really great facility that that community is now able to enjoy so what a week this was a fantastic opening I know Emily and that you 've mentioned it in your report as well but the opening of the toe or curative recreational sport long time coming for this community it 's fantastic it was an amazing afternoon the Sun came out which was really nice we had people from the community of course and the children and invited guests which were all wanting to celebrate the replacement of the old earthquake damaged qe2 it was a fantastic day and I know it 's dangerous to be thanking people but a part of making the council for getting on with that and their team from staff that really got that together it was just an amazing outstanding we 've always kept in the loop all the way through also the Apollo team Steve hasty and his team it was just absolutely outstanding so very very exciting day that was and it was very appropriate to open the qe2 facility on the Queen 's birthday weekend so whether that was planned intentionally not short but it was just a fantastic I don 't think you 'll get 14,000 people with their necks wicked well as you say it was a Ellis full capacity yeah you know over the weekend so so exciting to see so there was a lot of happy faces and a lot of week ones I must say and the image is going to remain indelibly implanted I 'm sorry the other person that I saw as takis which was really great so it was Aaron not was great to see him on you counsel is but some of us accidentally on purpose forgot ere talk so yeah you know it was an amazing day so thanks very much exciting now we 're going to go to the memorandum of understanding but uh ternary Community Trust attached on this last time what we 've actually had up now that was a really special evening that we had there with Rob in the team and Rachel you can see us there we all signed our thing it was beautifully decorated the room with a mess of big chocolate cake but it was a signing of that Memorandum of Understanding which acknowledged and all the development you know to develop and support this group and the positive and special working relationship that we have with them so that was a real honor to be there and to celebrate that so got on actors for all the work that they do in the community and now we have a special agreement and understanding between us so that was a really nice evening as well to some of our other significant issues we had last time I was here we talked about some resource consenting issues that we haven 't Southshore not just in South Shore but regarding the high flood hazard management come to us and had raised their concerns and they weren 't getting too far so the community board organized a meeting with the resource consent staff and that was a really positive meeting we had it a few weeks ago and the staff and the residents found it very beneficial and they appreciated it very much the time that was taken to discuss and understand oh you were not at that red zone but now yeah exactly so that was really great and we had a really good feedback since then and some positive actions from that meeting have been done and also the north-central Heathcott community hosting us affects them as well and the area so they 're actually now going to be hosting a workshop to get some gain some understanding on how that affects the residents the other issue that we do I sounding like a cracked record the history edge issues there and South Brighton and that area around the camping ground we had we 've had two workshop now which has been really good with staff region and II can to discuss the lack against erosion which are needed the proposed works in this area just we 've just put them slightly on hold until we have another meeting tomorrow to debrief about the meetings that we 've just had so really putting a lot of time and E for them to this this is an issue for the community as we 've mentioned and the long term plan but just to flag that the E Street unit I trust have also clearly stated and elated to the mirror and in their ltp submissions that the stretch of the each needs erosion protection now so and that we have had an estimate cost of about five hundred thousand but in the last couple of days sadly with the weather that we 've just had another trees which she fallen over and more damage to the edge occurred so you know urgency is really needed for this at the moment so the next thing we 've got will mention that talking about the red zone Vicky brought up last time about the the area there so we have actually as a board ass learns to transitional use that hasn 't ended there along that over no DeCaro corridor another exciting thing that opens also that lands mentioned in her report was the red zone futures even Otero River corridor options which has they have the offices and central city idea and wanting the feedback from our residents so there 's been really good interest in this exhibition and the board will be visiting at the center in the coming weeks it 's going to take us quite a few hours to look at all the information because there 's some amazing pictures and information to go with it so you know that 's exciting and finally also the pier has been repaired and it 's open and complete so you can now go fishing on the end of it and enjoy the pier again so yeah thank you so is one minute remaining of your ten minutes thank you very much for your report there it 's good then I 'm presume David you 'd like to move the receipt of the report on the second of bugling Lovingston including the photos that 's why motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much Karin Tata it 's great in Kashmir community board you 've only got a short report board report this time I 'd like to draw your attention to the on the front page where we 're looking at the youth awards there are three young people 's there who have got traveling internationally one two of them are going to future problem-solving world championships but the last bloke the young man is going to Globe Theatre Workshop and performances in London and I just can 't really believe the experiences that young people can have these days and I 'll see the appearance must shudder when they think of the next project that those kids are going to involve themselves in but that to max the joys of being on a community board is that you get to see those that give those awards and see sometimes see them come back and report on them um with I 'm just want to mention briefly the couple of projects in our ward coronation Centennial Hall in our last meeting these are sort of two two structures that have been sitting in our Ward since the earthquakes one and since a motorbike went into it the other that remain unused and unloved and uncared for and we look forward to the LTP coming out to find out if we can actually further the issues that both of them carry in the center of our Ward it 's depressing seeing both of these structures that were heavily used in their day deteriorating in the middle of the ward and we would like to we have hopes that the LTP will give us something that could either assist in making fun decking a system making decisions about both and the off the ground fund is a fund that was established actually was Ginny Huey 's idea staff member Ginny Huey and it was her ideas several years ago immediately after the earthquake that we would have a small fund that would give joy and the intent of the funders to do nothing else it is only to one off two organizations for whatever they dream up intention really is to give joy and it is one of those it has become of increasing importance in a way because the small funds have gone small and it 's really nice to have something that we can say to the community we can help with that when they 've got a bus truck for older people or planning to build a dragon in the kindergartens playground and then and it does give us joy to to be able to approve some of the applications that we most the applications that we get and the processes of there 's no process really it 's just they ask for something tell us why and we say this community workshop on the district plan and resource management that processes this took a long time to organize and I wish we did more of them some of the processes of council and legislation are arcane and difficult to understand and being able to talk to the community about how the district plan is organized what it does where it happens who 's in charge and the resource management debt processes and the I think I 'd like to I 'd like us to do more of them the the other thing I wanted to mention are we put in years we had the mother of all cleanups and one of the founders of the river network is on our board helene mount nur and our board involves ourselves all of the members of our board involve ourselves in this this is a cleanup of the river from the his from the top of the earth get through to the history and all of the organizations along his get power ho heels get are involved and people to come along in huge numbers actually to clean up I think it was eight hundred just honor and that I collected and we have the cooperation of the council staff which is great and we met I met lots of residents on the day who were helping to clean up with their children and this was this was used today see that K Faye Collins on our staff well she made that cake for us and we had we had won the opening of the a pile of books the icing was a pile of books and faith and they fence at the tops icing as well and with the trellis and so they made that and she does it out of the great goodness of her heart and and we had this is a morning tea for the crop gardeners and if you look at their all of those people they 're heavily involved elsewhere in the community some of them were in the junior children 's library some of them are involved John cousins is there and Rick they 're involved in the craft residents association Carolyn Harrow second third to lift is a cracker off Wilson was born a cracker off Wilson and the non suburb and I 've got a discussion about that of Cray craft which is one of the vines is that they 're not officially a so the craft is named after her family as as the old stone house and she set the example of going on the zipline at a very at a glorious age and so all of those people there were gardeners in the gardens and they acted under the control the stern control of Norma and Roberts what Betty Betty and Norman Roberts under the stew of beauty and norman roberts who were the ones who saved the old stone house and they great they 've had to give up the garden it has got too much for them and they we came in and had a morning tea with them yesterday which was terrific I had ordered lemming Tain 's and cream on everything um and the silent language week these are for quite frightened people singing in the foyer of the City Council here and they came from rally school until Morton school to sing for some on language week they did that last Thursday didn 't they was last Tuesday and the progress report with the pamphlet Melanie will be is absolutely thrilled that her idea of a pamphlet coming out in the rates has finally come to fruition and the age-friendly is age-friendly action plan is being launched at the older adults network meeting next in 4th of July and there on the back is a note about the it means to be a suburb and how you get to be a suburb and whether you are a suburb or not and this is arisen because the name hoon has been splashed around 10 or 11 K 's apart one goes up the belly one goes up the valley near a horse will quarry panic but who and hey itself is over that over much closer to the side of town and sprayed and near sprayed and sorry and that was an issue that we 'd like to raise with staff which is there and I think it probably is an issue everywhere thank you so used to cheering you just I was I was just um I was just looking up how you make a locality and create you know so the suburb names hey make them official and yeah I thought yep yep to me it 's all been done the only organization that doesn 't recognize that is the council yes but how do you mean well that 's gone it 's been registered or whatever through the government so that the the crown has recognized suburb as a suburb so there 's a New Zealand Geographic board but yes they 've done all that but that 's the council that doesn 't and there are there we see them post recognize it so yeah that 's the anomaly well yeah it 's not respondent advising that the areas returned in a rates and valuation search and not what would be considered suburbs they are administrative boundaries and do not align to other agencies definition of suburbs so so well you 're all you 're asking is that our rates and valuation search identifies er is a suburb not as just as an area that they can rate would take will take it up dominate some brought to our attention officially thank you right so this term would you like to move the receipt of the report and seconded by Phil I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that is carried that meeting it very much popularly in us community boards Eddie Jones Christina main thank you [Music] what I know what I know right well as you already had too many happy birthdays anyway and so you 'll see from our PowerPoint that today the presentation is brought to you by mud there 's quite a bit going on in the ward and of course with the weather that we 've had there 's quite a lot of mud in our photographs the really good news obviously for our ward is that apart from some surface flooding with all the rain that we 've had there haven 't been problems and I think that that 's all credit to the work that has gone in and the effort that 's gone on over the last two or three years so this is acid albans park and pavilion there 's the mud a lot of rain that 's a lovely looking cricket pitch in the middle that is all on track and in fact i 've had some really positive feedback from residents who have just got in touch and said it 's really moving along at a pace which is wonderful to see and I think all credit again to staff for keeping residents and the loop as well know part a recommendations actually just don 't go back to that two main issues in the ward at the moment and we 'll just let the pictures go through well actually that 's our first main issue in the ward actually the Northern Corridor is powering along I let the pictures just roll through there on a timer and we are we 've just completed consultation which has called the downstream effects of the CNC the Northern Corridor project and we delivered all stuff delivered 12,000 documents to residents 400 submissions were received a hundred and eighty of those were received after the first two of four sessions four or five sessions consultation sessions the board will have a workshop giving us feedback on what not detailed not drilling down but an overview of the consultation on the 20th of June and I imagine we 'll be able to make some public comment after that but not before the 20th I think what 's really important to note here especially in this public forum is that there has been some reportage around and we 'll always get a foregone conclusion it 's a fait accompli councils made its mind up etc etc and I said in the last presentation from the board to the council that the consultation documents are fantastic as far as the information they contain and how clear they are so it 's really disappointing to hear that actually from residents and attending one of the consultations I had someone say exactly the same thing to me and I think by the end of the conversation speaking to staff their opinion had changed what staff have said to me and council officers at the consultation is that they have received some really valid interesting and significant suggestions and information from residents and that 's the whole point of consultation so those will be I am sure a number of those will be incorporated and we 'll hear about that on the xx it 's also important to note that the project along the CNC corridor here is an NZTA project primarily with the CNC team involved in Christchurch City Council staff but it is an NZTA project so that has been put in place the Innes Road intersection we are doing what our community has asked us to do and look at how we can mitigate those or the increased traffic and congestion so we 're actually just doing what our community is asking us to do so again it is I have to say a little disappointing when we are perhaps accused of not doing what we should have been perhaps not doing what we should have done any sooner this is the soonest that we could do it so we look forward to that presentation on the 20th the second biggest issue in the water at the moment is still around the Richmond Shirley area and I think again staff engagement was residents there has been excellent there have been two or three hookups and I 'm not going to go into details with it there was some Flyers that weren 't delivered and that 's been dealt with very very quickly by staff and it 's unfortunate where we 've got a community that is still so ruled that these things happen but again staff have been fantastic at pulling that or a community meeting that is scheduled for what 's my my ear Christine Tuesday they all know that we 've had that 13th or 15th of June so it 's in mid June and this will be to address the concerns of residents and they will be staff there as well and we 're doing a roading audit around the area because that 's clearly a concern with the standard and quality of the roads so there will be eroding audit and that information will be presented at that as well and that 's been received positively by members of the community so those are the two main ones some positive stuff happening in the ward as well I mean obviously the San Albans Park that 's very positive the papanov bush and the Bridgestone reserve regeneration project we had our second planting day on Tuesday John stringer and EMA Norrish braved the cold weather we thought it would be snowing and there were 700 plants planted initially in the first stage in April in the second stage how many hundred fifteen hundred plants were planted yesterday Papa noe and so that 's a very very positive project to regenerate the native forests and the Bridgestone Reserve just being with me while I flick through my notes we 're increasingly are Boyd and impressed by community organizations engaging with areas of the community one such project at the moment is the Papa Nui Community Survey it 's being driven by the Papa Nui bub Baptists freedom and Northgate Trust 's it started and March at the Papa nori neighborhood day and it 'll go through octo to October this year there are 70 individual surveys that have been completed to date and what this involves is social media Facebook and neighborly are also reaching residents but there 's door-knocking going on and it 's going around the neighborhood and saying are you okay are there any issues that 's that face-to-face contact and invariably it throws up issues that we would never have known about in these community groups would never have known about otherwise so that is a really positive thing that our community groups are doing I think that is about all I don 't take up no that 'll do I 'll talk at the time at the front end I 'm just quickly fill in Jimmy Thank You Ellie the PowerPoint you head around the northern arterial just seem to be a section the where there might be potential into the public transport to actually have some land set aside for a form of park-and-ride if you 're bored it 's really interesting so we hadn 't thought of that actually I think it 's something yeah and the geese and that 's right Paul needs to see it coming through and the submissions and that 's where it will come through and we can we can address it but yeah that 's a very good point because the cycleway obviously in getting people using it just in case you didn 't know because it 's going to be a very busy road what we 're trying to do as Bryn cycle cyclists through McFadden 's road and onto the cycle way that goes down Rutland Street so I sort of taking them off that really busy road they will be speedy cyclists much like speedy Cranford street one but there is an option to take kids for example in schools in the area but you know that 's good idea Thank You Jimmy 20 you mention a papa Louie community so wait well I think because they volunteered groups mainly Jimmy and you know it 's people who are working as well as doing the survey there will be tenants whom and and people who own house the houses that aren 't there so they 'll go back and review seasonally I think it 's a good idea to get an idea of what the issues are across the years through the summer in the spring and the winter which can throw up other issues as well so yeah it 's a long time but it gives us really good and thorough it gives the organization 's really good information thank you thank you very much so might would you like to move this Paul in like to second it I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's Carrie thank you very much um Phillips Mack McClintock Aaron as well oh into Aaron is where I am good morning Linda birthday in Japanese is the same Japan happy birthday good morning a chance to present a board report it 's relatively light this month and that we 've had one meeting the second meeting didn 't reach corn because of the LTP submissions and we felt that it was more important that councilors with you then to come in to that but we 've played catch up on Monday made quite an extensive meeting just a couple of things to touch on firstly there were no parties but we 've got one of you come in next month so heads up on that and then as we go through got a bit of a PowerPoint there just we thought we 'd highlight just a couple of key things happening in their ear at the moment just to update you around the jelly Park recreational center so that 's still ongoing and there 's a sparkle in this one which have essentially been completed and there 's more being done around the outdoor area we hope Freese road replacement water tank and again that 's something that will come to you eventually is just to are you signaling out for consultation that 's coming to the board hopefully like julen at late June but it may be early July so just a heads up on that Arbor Day tree panel you 'll see David and Aaron doing the heavy lifting on the health and safety officer for the day standing back we had that on Monday which was quite effective and a nice way to start our board meeting and before I hand over to Aaron I just want to touch on this one community issue which and has been in the media recently were in our local papers around parking issues particularly in my water in the way Mary Ward around the Rusli Business Park it 's more just a signal that there has been a call for from some locals for reason and parking but we 're obviously aware that at the moment we don 't have that facility as again that 's just a highlight to you Aaron did you wanna yeah touch the bishop owl means I just like to acknowledge selling back behind me here and helping start the group with the community the previous community board not only do they do what they do which I 'm sure you all know but they also helped out the board or the joint boards of phenol tone end and people returned with culture galore and doing that kind of traffic management on the day so volunteering the time and the support to help not only you know what they 're doing there but also the wider community so thank you very much for that and the only other thing just to notice the community service awards so I would head 11 11 nominations and from them and we 're working through them at the moment so they 'll be presented to us at the upcoming board meeting and then there 'll be an awards ceremony on the 3rd of July so that 's everything from us like I say next month we 've got a wee bit to come through I 'm just so taken with us because I mean the social quite a wonderful wonderful thing and I had no idea that was going on so it 's really great that you bring these things you know please do because I just think that maybe use this as an opportunity weird live-streamed to to tell a little bit about the story because it 's fantastic it 's an organization that 's some spread throughout New Zealand so if the US people watch behind that viewing from other parts of New Zealand there 's there 's a mean kid near you is a mention you you I think this one Amberly past so yeah it 's just a fantastic spot to keep kind of total hands a little bit more active also engages the mind the the men that go along to this this is what there 's a shyness that they need to kind of overcome because yeah and they 're always keen just on that and for a visit something you honours in the community there 's a couple of days each week without their and they 're always more than welcome to hear from from Eva so keep that of New Zealand mean that to come out of the show and to kind of interact there takes a big step for some to overcome so the introduction for many can be quite slow but once they get over then they can get within the organisation it 's really good and they are absolutely expanding into kind of engaging Pauline and in yeah you think this is an incredible program I know that they 've actually leaned I think they means she had built quite a few planter pots through our social housing units too so it 's a great community donations that the community but my question is do you just seem in the collection in this form with really disquieting misty counsel as a whole I really like this idea of group of the mana for the community boards shirts of Mary and fur yes so look we need to do the squee have so many groups with them and every board does have so many groups that do such good work that 's right and the recognition is really important and the great thing about this is a lot of businesses where it actually saves the council money and gives these guys a purpose so it 's a 1-1 really block building our plan to ports for the social housing one of the board reports last year that I presented they were making kids seeds for penguin houses basically the school code school children could then construct and would presented to conservation groups along the coastline firms of England thank you and Sam you actually touched on what I was going to ask about perfectly you pat the moonship partners with Council on projects what are some of the projects that they do work alongside council weapon how can we strengthen their because it 's such a great way for water yes so obviously the one that fell on Glee would talk about in terms of social housing so the planter boxes was one of them I mean as Erin mentioned as well the culture the Lord so I mean for us it 's it 's kind of just identifying projects in the area that we 're we 're off and Mary Ann is really good at and do it so we don 't necessarily need to get in the middle of it but if we can put the right people in contact they go on and it adds real benefit at a really low cost to the community they 're very keen to activate the space the the former bishop tower library site which is now to stick grassed area that 's gonna roped off that would be great for all of their community boards the prince you know focus on that a little bit in all those groups because I think we all have one it would be good to sort of strengthen that relationship thank you think thank you very much and I 'm assuming that Jamie would like to move the report and Erin would like to second it I will put that motion all those in favor say aye there 's a person no that 's Carrie thank you the Lynwood central heathcote community board and I know I 've jumped over one but they expire request so if we could come forward Thank You Sally should I nice to see you start I just wanted to tell you that the Eagle height of the evil sorry a hoot I trust and he 's been listening on a project since 2009 and they finally got this room yeah the Aven history has officially received status is a Flyway site network site I didn 't know if you knew this or not but as a network for such important sites Nettie 's wetlands used by migratory wetland water birds and this is a project organized by East Asia Australasian Flyway partnership there are only currently two other sites I 'm just English I can 't say it 's just it was we got an early heads up but it was kind of like please keep this quiet because it 's we want to announce it so I 'm happy yes but you may be announcing it in public just chipping in it 's on Facebook absolutely fantastic and we 've been wanting to shout it from the rooftops since we were told so please please talk about the status in case tell people so that 's yeah I don 't know it 's it it 's a fantastic piece of news I you know I just saw such good piece of news to share and I just want to make sure when you yeah this is only the third place isn 't it yeah and when I was feel well spurt and the other ones the first teams so um you know I think it 's really big news yeah and an area so it 's great I 'll go back to our board report and we had no part as and we 've approved lots of road markings and tracking restrictions as you can see oh yeah you don 't need them and we 've done lots of funding for a variety of projects through different parts of our funding but also our discretionary fund and we a significant council projects that the biggest one of course is that we approved the site for a new lender walleston port facility and and as you can see there it is the in this that 's really really exciting now we can enter the concept designs which has to come which will come back as well so it 's really good and we had a visit to see her the dredging is going on and in his quiver at the walleston cat and that was you know amazing that the only of you who have who have small boys or grandchildren or something and want to see get them to see some machinery going and just is a great place to take them um yeah next one our public forums been really well attended and you can see some of the things there that people have talked to us about I think I think the biggest one here is that and people came in and talked about temperate alcohol being and Lynwood village and here what a what a great difference it 's making and then one fellow tweet we 're really happy we really want it permanent ban Ania and when you know people are saying to us it is making a difference yep to me to make more meters of interest we had a proposal from some some people to say they 'd really like to see walsim Park revitalized as a and we 'd really like to see that go ahead with the other thing we 're doing is updating first aren 't we yeah we 've organized farthest from our discretion we found that the receptive port and the area to try and make sure we have it safe first and then we 'll work from there yes this one we have a group that works with us and we have representatives from our board on this and we 're paying for a camera on the corner of Aberdeen and Manchester Street from our discretionary fund for a security for this for this group and it 's going to hit already that 's been approved next one next one I 'd like to talk about a wee bit more and you 've got quite a lot of writing up there which you probably won 't go up to read but basically in 2017 you down in November meeting we asked staff to urgently meet with the police to discuss the installation monitoring the closed-circuit cameras closed-circuit cameras and the affected areas and the vicinity of Linwood village and authorizing installation at the December meeting of council a resolve to urgently meet with police to discuss the installation and monitoring of closed-circuit cameras so we 've been waiting since December to see about this because we are prepared if we 're prepared to take this money out of our discussion front but we know that after the earthquakes the council provided the police with a budget to install security cameras around the city and maintain them once installed and this budgets now been cut so there 's only a budget for maintaining the existing cameras and the current LTP has no provision for any new security cameras but like I say we 're prepared to pay for these but we just need action on this point you see because we we know that they 're needed there we know it 's a police priority and we 'd really like to see this move ahead as fast as possible so I 'm just wondering if we can have some feedback from staff about how quickly we can get that done I 'll leave it one with you the installation of flagpoles and flagpoles there we 've got a recommendation that we provide information on the installation of flag poles and we will be prepared to pay for this but I think that it 's not necesarily I think the the return Services Association may pay for those but we did have we did have a flagpole on the old some of the community center building prior to the earthquakes so they like they want one for the insect day services water fountains we know you can see we had twenty thousand dollars from the last year 's annual plan process allocated to fountains in the central city and staff identifying suitable sites for this but we 've also asked them to look a right across our board area for other possible sites as well the other thing I 'd like to bring to your attention is something that coastal Burwood raised with you and that 's effect of that H if Z in a zone where the flooding zone burned all the coastal areas where we 're getting people who are buying sections and the reckless type area where and paying huge 't get a resource consent to build on there so we organized we 're currently organizing together seminar was hopefully of Penance staff to have some sort of resolution for this because it 's going to meet end up there 's an issue which will get a lot of earring and I think in the newspaper we don 't get something organized with it I think that 's all today thank you very much I think that final wash suits been raised with the council and from an organizational point of view we do need to have a better understanding of how the district plan rules which which have been implemented through the independent hearings panel proceeds a star player on a seminar for us I think yeah try and understand this but it 's a close to food with joints it is a joint thing yeah very much so any banks potentially as well not you too so there 's cameras for them advantage would be a big priority for us thank you thank you thank you for your long-term plan but it and your annual report I hope so moved by Dion receipt of the reports Sikandar by Yanni I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried thank you so effect to horse all form be written community board across much phone Gary Watson morning Russ morning man cancellous thanks for the opportunity pretty short from us fortunately just our delegated decisions were a couple of small one making decisions nothing critical we 're probably just an hour delegation we yeah just granted a lease to conservation new zeal the conservation volunteers New Zealand London and these people are going to reside at the former managers house bori bori was built in 1927 switch out of the facility via so can accommodate up to eight people in there and the manager will have a day office and the bottom area down there this group have very impressive set of Statistics and I just gloss over him in the last twelve months they planted one hundred and fifty eight thousand trees propagated 128,000 we did six hundred and fifty hectares removed three thousand eight hundred kilograms of rubbish put hundred community groups this was a absolute one for us to get these people here they have facilities in Wellington punic like Ian Dunedin and what will happen here is they will reside there and then what they will be tasked an association with their Park Rangers team a work within the quarry itself in the wider area and also able to be offered to third-party organizations and I think you 'll recall the long-term plan here that 's submission from the Bradley trust which came and he mentioned early if there 's time available they convince you 're over there for days at a time and work away the I think you 'll recall they lost their Corrections Department labor so these are an ability to fill that little hole here yeah five year lease complete alcohol drug free policy up there it won 't be party paradise believe me I 'll feel vandana but yeah just a really good synergy I suppose what with that group moving on leadership groups the engagement team had the leadership day on the third of May over 39 people or a local were we use and very again just a really worthwhile get-together and it was able to to engage those people and where they go from there well obviously with that staying on that one we also have coming up 27th of June around community service and news service awards we 've got ten community service awards two huge service awards and a number of certificates of appreciation for people mix one Gary is yeah this one was Adam partnered in tandem with the arc development trust and Rick Adam this was absolutely brilliant to have old ray and older fella 85 year old come to our board and speaker he had never cooked in his life between him and his wife they had decided that either one on them all the other was going to go first which could leave him to have to repeat prepare the meals so this group engaged a professional chef and they 're going to do this on an ongoing basis over the next two years just to help those people older younger migrants etc just to be more prepared and more resilient in their prepared for themselves the other component of that as the migrant groups award based board members have been working to promote an emergency resilience plan which was just supposed preparing them should the worst happen and their communities with various things up and operating there are four critical networks and our water area they also the Asian group Hornby community workers luncheon that a recommend Network the Asian group and the invent youth workers forum these were all groups that were originally initiated by our community and engagement teams and now that virtually all been taken over under the wing of the community facility facilitated operations yeah big one coming up or just completing really an area is that the record and road upgrade it 's been a huge effort this one over a long time things will sit and settle down until the next stage which is from Harry Kiki Street through to to Mehta post street major saw up great major upheaval busiest bus route in Canterbury and it was past the Westfield more tender processors M&O and the contractor hopefully to be appointed in October fatin kohonen first stage come along to a board and nerve initiated a new process whereby they 're putting him down these two I see where she felt was about this in this case it 's it 's about this so it 's really a long-term effects done well done properly given the obvious upheaval to the whole community based on the works in the area that 's a really good long to process a wee bit more but you know you get what you do recently and this was a bit of a sad story with it with a good ending and the up of Memorial Library was forcibly closed by our staff engineers because of an unsafe building one of those difficult scenarios with the community own the building but this council owned the land underneath er and as landowners we are reliable as an entity should something occur had a walkway as you can see just beside the container the public walkway it had to be closed which meant obviously everything had to come out of that building in this case 14 council staff took it on themselves along that library out just a really worthwhile day it was the engineers that had to shout at them it was the engineers that turned up in their own time to do that work to empty that library and the feedback we got from there from that elder group at the library it 's just wonderful to know there 's so many angels are still out there in Christchurch after we 've all been through what we have in our city so a nice feedback a bit like Kashmir sprayed and with a couple of holes in the area which don 't do we fix do we not you know there 's a use there but it 's a sustainable use and once you but here this one a bit of a tongue twister Mike told me they 've got to get out the hyper helpful random facts and just a little bit of information on a former temple Don Hospital site was close close to 20 years ago now it 's a unique area which still has a institutional base but not quite the ring fence that used to happen drug and alcohol program Innovation Park with those some agribusiness and research to the in tenants and their breckenridge which is the supporting people was elected short disabilities whis Mont School which is a private Britain and church based school is the temple region capital and they 're all also tagged in there as well as the whiter Haskell what has schools recently relocated to a school called temple sorry lemon would range in rolleston however they are setting up a sub site in the new night Stream school and horse walk and it 's a very much integrating some of these some disability based and lecture based um facilities within the communities a11 there other than that that 's all from out west all things are relatively stable in concern no no I think we haven 't got time for questions so we 've reached our 10 minutes so thank you very much okay very good very good time this motion Timmy team would like to move and Galloway would like to second and I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no the conclusion of the community board reports and we 'll move on to the chief executive report Brenda thanks me I just like to bring a small number of meters to the teaching of councillors I like the report is read both the Mia and Kimani have already talked this morning about the successful lightening of Torah in the 14,000 people tour over Quinn 's birthday weekend in the project was put in under budget in on time so fantastic of India and we 've talked about celli park and but also just to bring the council 's attention that they refurbished pioneer week in sports into opened earlier in May and the LTP is both kept counselors busy but also staff busy in these commentary in the report or net I 'm not the successful election of Tyrone fields following the by-election to the bank 's peninsular community board in just finally included in your information as a supplementary report in the measles I circulated some separate information regarding the appointment of Helen Beaumont to lead the improvements to the water program so this is recognition that the experiences as the meal task force for flooding this is a type of project that does require dedicated in skilled expertise in the apartment of Hell into this role and we think will make a measurable difference too and the quality the outputs that we 're giving and we think this is a recognition of the talents and expertise that Helen also brings to the role and she 's grown Owen and two counselors has got the technical background in very experienced in water matters so we 're looking for two and who are getting her feet under and the disk issues already started and the role the appointment is reporting directly to the chief executive it 's for 12 months the reason for the 12 month appointment is that it and her role is expected to both manage the well hits improvement program their temporary temporary chlorination but also to prepare and ensure that we 're in the right position to respond to any central government changes which might go well beyond the 12 month period I 'm here with second any questions Thank You Leah Thank You Jamie it take it back to Carlene but it 's I 'm finding the this least helpful than what it used to be I think it 's um you know anything if they in thinking for the commentary around that they at last but but just by way of the suggestion I don 't know what other counselors think that I really like the dashboard approach which used to be taken and I 'm finding that it 's sort of gravitating more to a new Sleater approach which is fine and there 's look some good stuff in there but it 's just been able to track their progress with things so it 's like service delivery kept a copy X key metrics may be the major projects and how they 're tracking or IT rollout nets or stuff in just a dashboard approach around here today versus full year and budget actual and then variance and then forecast actual and variance that sort of stuff is really helpful when they see EES report so I just that 's a suggestion from me that that dashboard approach on some of those key great but a lot of the stuff we already know and we 're briefed on so that 's just my two cents worth on there yeah yeah yeah if possible please yeah okay yeah okay I 'm just good take two questions one is in regards to the chlorination issue are we able to get an understanding of progress in terms of how many well heads have have been secured and get some more regular reporting on progress and related to that are we able to produce a map showing where people and get either filtered water or non non chlorinated water I mean I don 't quite know how we get progress on the on these issues they have been emailed through raised I 'm happy to take those two issues back to there and take them passed it on to Helens day I think there 's a report coming to council next week so and I don 't know that the second issue will be covered off on that but the first issue certainly will be so because there 's a lot of there 's a lot of relation to assessing each of the well heads and relation to the pumping station because as we know the chlorine goes in at the pump not at the wellhead and and we want to reduce the amount of chlorine going into the water as quickly as possible with the intention of removing it as soon as we possibly can or giver so so in terms of the report next week if we 've got ideas for things like that have been raised you know maybe council it costs water filters or maybe having filling stations our service centers and libraries for non-chlorinated water is that the time to raise those issues yes so raise them Dean because I mean literally how in Beaumont and I really welcome the focus of the chief executives brought to this issue because what it signals is an overarching approach recognizing that this is not just a council issue it 's a Ministry of Health our show it 's a drinking water Assessor associates a medical officer of health issue and it 's obviously of primary concern it 's a community issue they want to do we Tim thank you that I see it through to Carlene and issue from a resident although I 'd love to take credit I can 't about a regular update here in Helens and place because UFC right this is a city issue a resonance issue ratepayers issue and probably the single most important issue seeking even over above the OTP to have the live updates so we are live streamed and have the odd update to councillors as I think great but for the residents of waste of time so I think to have for Helen or somebody doing it a regular update here would be really helpful Carlene agreed with this yeah there 's also a blog that 's now developed through news line which has been regularly updated as well so the blog will now contain Helens new role and and she 'll be in front of the council next week yeah so it 's been enormous ly challenging for here to take the role up last Friday and she 's in front of council next Thursday yeah yes that 's a very good idea thank the resource consent stuff you say that you 're doing a review of the engagement strategy a number of of us around the table always get sort of you know complaints about the resource consenting process and stuff like that can we feed into that review course thank you it 'd be good good any other questions would someone like to move that thought we received two second up by Mike I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you and we 'll move on to my report and and as I 've identified and there may has been a very busy month for all councillors with the LTP hearings dominating proceedings and obviously working through the myriad of issues that has raised the drinking water supply as I said I 've asked management to focus the next report on the work required to further reduce the chlorine being added to the system so that 's that regular approach to just keeping the foot on the pedal things that we 're and so I really welcome the announcement from and her ability to report to us through the chief executive directly I mean I think it 's a very good reporting regime in its um it 's going to see action taken I think this often preliminary assessment work that 's necessary isn 't seen as action but I can assure you if we can switch off wellheads and that allows the pump not to be chlorinated recognizing that there are certain pressure levels that have to be maintained then their achievements and we 're on our way to get into chlorine free so that you know I can reassure counselors that work is going on very hard behind the scenes I was more than disappointed to be told the cost of reinstating the Town Hall had gone over budget it was very late advice only a month before we were told it was on track and we were put under pressure to sign off on the additional funding because it was we needed to sign contracts for the fire piece of work the media we 're going to be briefed on site on June but an attention and date created a false impression that we were holding this bag there was no intentional was always going to be released this month and so I 've asked the chief executive to ensure that release recommendations are now included in all PX papers and she has actions that request and as I 've said on many occasions the total project is still well under what a brand-new facility would have cost we 've saved a heritage building and the csro has a permanent home I think there 's been some misleading commentary which has suggested that this reduces the amount that 's available when the performing arts precinct that nothing could be further from the truth the additional funding for this has not come from the performing arts delivery side of thing which still has the same amount of money on budget for the for the completion of the building on the other the other element the other part of the Performing Arts precinct sorry the rest of my reporters all the good news and I 'm happy to take any questions okay one that I didn 't think was transport that the regional public transport plan that we worked had a workshop on what concerns me is that this council has already asked that that that committee see full electrification of the public transport fleet by a certain date so we understand that tomorrow but there needs to be a timeline by which it does happen so will that go to the to the Joint Committee and what further possibility is there for the public to be involved in attempting to change the model that we currently operate which is very much a race to the bottom in terms of public transport yes so the what what the Joint Committee members have been given is an early draft and that 's what we 've workshopped so all of the workshop ideas and I can say that Christchurch City will be promoting the the electrification of the bus fleet as part of that they will come back to the Joint Committee on the 20th of June for consideration and then it goes out for public consultation so there will be a very significant period of time available for public consultation publicized widely and that people do have their say it 's run by the Joint Committee on this occasion which has that the that he can cannot delegate the decision but they can delegate the formalities and so there will be hearings panel established at the Joint Committee I doubt it it 'll be a hearings panel I imagine Mike do you remember who 's that do you remember with that no I just can 't remember the the numbers that are on the hearings panel but they haven 't established the hearings panel yet the public hearings public submissions will be called for and there will be a hearing span or stablished and they will hear the submissions I don 't know the answer to that question that I expect that they will be no yeah I thought I 've volunteered to I volunteered to nominate you to the committee and you refuse to be part of it so I 'm not gonna support your nomination to the hearings permit okay thank you Oscar Oprah 's advice to new newly elected members was question everything so with the Town or you know either an existing one with one of our standing committees or a new one that looks at applying the blow torch in a respectful way would start but I get pretty frustrated over you know that the inflation bit but it 's like no I agree entirely and that 's why I 've already discussed with councillors the concept of establishing a capital program committee which is sole focus as that capital program all of it and that 's the you know that the large projects and then the programs of work that settle underneath it so yes or no we would certainly picked up and that 's why I said in there we need to lift our game on monitoring the capital program and that 's why I 've raised that with councillors I 've raised that with the chief executive she also thinks that 's a very good idea and it 's I think an important way forward and it 's the the issue in relation to to this matter though was that as I understand it the the chief executive is going to sort and as you also know part of the resolution of this particular measure was to agree a new process for signing off on the contingency which is now no longer at the project management level that is now lifted right up to the to the general manager level so that it can 't just be signed off yeah I agree and we just need straight communication like the say what you mean mean what you say stuff on yeah it 's tightly for tight so tight controls as what we want to see from a governance perspective and and a good clear reporting structure that is across the board at the moment we 've got different projects reporting to different committees and I think that having you know you know and I 've sort of said a rottweiler approach at the at the head of it will but is that I agree with you it entirely respectful but there is a there is a provision in relation to how yeah there is a provision in terms of how haratz haratz reported so we 've got to tighten up Jonnie thank I just wondered if you could just give us a very quick explanation around the decision-making around the redzone futures particularly because we are getting lobbied as individual councillors for certain projects and just wondered if you could just clarify in terms of our role as elected members as a City Council in terms of what happens there versus regenerate in the minister because I think it would be quite beneficial for people to have a clear understanding sorry I said again sorry for the red zone futures the attack or open river corridor is open for feedback and obviously we 've been getting a number of emails from individuals concerned over certain projects whether they should be in so can you just give us a kind of clear understanding of the price is around the decision-making around the projects that are going to be happening in the red zone going forward and what our role is no that 's that 's not what the exhibition 's about so I honestly thought that regenerate Christchurch had already reported to us on on the process going forward but I 've yeah process going forward as part of this report we 've had regenerate crushers front of everybody yesterday well as I understand it we 're not making decisions on the future as a red zone as a council that 's a metaphor regenerate Christchurch no it 's not it 's a metaphor signing off by the minister that is a process that 's under the Greater Christchurch regeneration act and what regenerate Christchurch is doing as developing a regeneration plan which will be signed off by the minister not by the council right yeah okay but we will be submitting on it obviously just just carrying on from gianni what is the process then I mean being blobby by certain groups of their produce that made of main be in the program at the moment what is their role in that particular function there where we are now starting to hear a lot of noise from certain sectors of the community over the plan that regenerate had come up with do we have any role or uncle yes clearly these are misunderstanding regenerate Christchurch are not deciding the particular projects that developing a regeneration plan which allows for certain projects to proceed in particular areas should they be resource to do so and but that 's a separate program project program it 's a separate process after the regeneration plan as is resolved so they 're out the air with the exhibition now about the specific areas they 've said that the green spine will be a given in terms of the in terms of the regeneration plan we can take bettors read there are three areas which they 've asked for further input from the community in relation to their view is about what uses those particular pieces of land could be put to so I think that one of the issues that 's come up more than once as the as the temporary use and I have to say that I 'm not entirely first with the process that that sits around temporary use we do need a stronger utilisation of the red zone for temporary purposes for up to five years and different areas some of these project decisions won 't be made for years you know in depending on how long it takes to fundraise for particular options that may or may not be able to proceed so but why don 't we just get regenerate Christchurch and we 'll keep them in front of the council at a meeting such as this perhaps the next one before the before the submissions close on the exhibition and we 'll get them to repeat what they have said to different workshops that certainly I 've been to out in the community explaining the process it 's all dedicated to you on their website but I know that not everyone would have read all of the detail so we 'll get them into the into a meeting will get them in front of a live stream and they can explain the process in front of everyone all right does anyone want to move my report on hey just quickly want to make a comment oh I 'm happy to move one second so you can see Kendall in when I just quickly I think um the most important thing is that the community understand how these decisions are going we have so you influenced that so why are you doing so I mean not the big of my report I 've just said we 'll get regenerate crotchet you 've said you don 't understand the procedural and that will be asked to give our feedback at some stage in terms of regeneration plan what I don 't understand is how the community in terms of their feet that to us as elected members how we incorporate that into our feedback so whether we have a specific consultation is reverse we do where we do that so um I just think it 's good be good to get some clarity given that we are getting a number of emails from people I 've just we bring regenerate christchurch here next next meeting yeah but it 's not us I think it 's to the community that needs that clarification to understand well circulate as well the link to the original crash equip sort which has got a dedicated section on the process in what I 've described is the braid and you 'll also be conscious that it does a clearly specified process and you can share that yani with your the people who are asking you so that so that they do understand it and we 'll get rid you know our christchurch and to reiterate it yeah the irony yes but we don 't need to do that right now and you don 't need to do it off the back of my report you know if I hadn 't mentioned that I 'd been to the opening of the exhibition you wouldn 't have raised any of these issues so you know I 'm just wondering whether my reporting that 's redundant whether I shouldn 't bother is that yeah okay so it 's been moved and it 's been seconded so I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried right we 'll move on to the zone committees annual reports and quarterly updates and I 've got all of Smith roofing and pure and welcome thanks for the help with the pumpkin Elm you did actually yeah you haven 't been told that the weight eight so your best team kgs ahead of the next closest computer and I think you know honestly I don 't need to know how you did it because you got your seedling a whole month later than everyone else yeah well well done anyway so congratulations in then I don 't know how the first one exploded either yeah well he was no no we 're nearing us si news I don 't need my waders because it 's so small so it 's been a big year for for several rows own committee of course you know early in the year seven row between dry and following a bit two and a half years of dry winters so had the very little recharge so the leader on from that was that we really a series of seminars at Lincoln University covering seven topics it was a seaman at lunchtime and and the evening we had seventy two hundred thirty people attending each time so it was then people associate the community know what we 've actually done in the water management space and they 're in a zone the other pumpkin project probably born was born out of it because we thought that we didn 't they should reach enough people still the next phone Nick 's highlight is 60mm that there 's been 95 percent of the 356 priority farms that have taken actions required for deer farm so it 's all going well the end tips are kind of consenting the other highlight for the year was they nearly 2.7 million of the government 's money the the freshwater Improvement Fund was allocated to projects that now Zone in one of them was actually directly to address the water shortage in the Selman River so from the CPW stage to pipe that runs across under the river we 've taken a bit of water from there we 'll put an off take in there to recharge the the basin if you like so they won 't run dry again and would be taking water from the you know in the off season when the farmers aren 't using it for irrigation and of course if Noelle 's oh it 's probably one of a few that money and the 100,000 and last year so basically speeding Hammond 100,000 TV single year in the last so many years now in other zones oh I hear struggling to spin years they spent all from me if you 've got any questions that you want ask sorry about that I was just sorry trekking onto the banks potential zone committee but we so we 're getting we 're getting some wording together that wall that we can resolve there does anyone have any questions for Alan Greene I just need to be careful not to make generalizations but you just sit for for so what and Reich in the cell and River so you 're seeking to you know give effective recharge when farmers aren 't using it again during that so CPW water I guess the you know they 're taking it would be more Makai River and they only use it to irrigate their land in the summer months so if it was gonna be a drive one day if we know that you know there hasn 't been enough recharge during those driven that period we keep the buffed up for if you like because you know this is just huge amount of water underneath the plains right if there hasn 't been recharged here for a few years in a row taken I think in the rivers gonna run dry again with this project you know we can keep keep the bathtub topped up and so we never there 's any kind of more water you know it all just coming under in the rivers and springs and the lower planes yeah we know that farming sectors feeling picked on so I just wanted to make sure you know are we making to great elite to say it 's due to ah let me speak to farming to there again it 's due to both also due to extraction you know by butter farmers and and it 's also due to the lack of recharge okay so in the typical year you might get about 25 cubics of recharge and the farmers will take part of it and part of it kind of goes down the river near the sea yeah do you know how reach outside overnight yeah and don 't quote me on it one all right okay thank you okay Oh David sorry actually a consequence of profession stages of that party numbers that were striking sustained yeah that 's correct Destin teeth of the CPW skin is to retire some of the groundwater so that walk and stay in the in the ground I wasn 't gonna raise the central plains but I 'm not I 'm not allowing it comment to go and charge could you explain to me please the the additional water irrigation in central plains water I 'm assuming that makes dairy farming in that area more economically viable I think it gives it more certainty yeah so I don 't know about the viability part of it not on to those figures and what about does your border is it just the West Melton one deal with the leaching of nitrates under the y MEK and I know it 's something that we smell from my phone your board doesn 't touch on that at all okay and yep just um I want to thank you out there I think you 've got fantastic engagement with the community it 's a very difficult issue often I particularly enjoyed the other day hearing about the people that are working with the farmers from Fonterra to to raise the standards of practice have you got two or three points that you could make in terms to us in terms of the improvement that 's being seen and the practice of some of the during famine yes that 's happening all the time I guess there 's been quite a bit of talk about you know moving farmers to different farming systems and so on but it 's got to be lead with research you know you can 't speak affirm that it kind of make changes and this don 't know what those changes are effective and yes I guess you know they won 't leap into unless that 's it 's proven so there 's actually a whole lot of research been done not just in theory but and and all sectors and a lot of improvement has already been made and violin systems are changing and this issue in some ways would it be appropriate for you to include in your next report some of the things that we learned about from the Fonterra people that are working with the farmers yes so we did actually ask for the information as well there you know they have unless you 've got all the details it either things are just moving very very quickly so we will be looking for those kind of numbers we are we interested in that ourselves and so I 'm if there 's a there 's interest here I 'll try to bring some of those numbers back for the next report excellent thank you very much now I 'm not sure which committee would like to report next in report there will be a we 're of the phrase eternity eternity eternity and one of the things for hours on committee is there is a crucial part of what we 've been trying to achieve in 2017 and going forward as well there 's a lot of good work being done as you can see in their report and we like for the immediate steps one of those was the whole listing here just finishing we speed it all that 's right allocated rule to the Port Hills recovery upon words with spear to assist with plantings and putting in some peace control fencing because it 's an unprecedented event obviously and if we give an opportunity to put a lot of biodiversity back into the area and help stop the loads coming down into the heat kill Apollo we thought that it was a great way to be involved and we hope that that can be taken further you 'll see it was so in the report there is a another initiative that we have been involved with which was started by one of their committee members which is around the copper brake pad issue and raising the awareness of how much copper is going into the storm water system and I understand the became chairman looking at putting a letter to the Minister of the Environment regarding a couple breaks we also just designed a postcard that it 's going to be passed out that sort of highlights addition aware there is an alternative to the count back beds so that 's that 's ongoing I know that the Kaveri was raised groundwater sub sub group has been inserted me to an identifying the groundwater protection area and making sure what 's shown on the maps is actually what has been done they did a lot of great work in a desire and tension this month to hold a workshop around the Waimakariri and I understand it yourselves and he can 't get him some updates tomorrow we are getting our one in two weeks as well and some of our zone committee members attended the wineries so we 're still bar diversity is something else that is important to our zone committee and we as I said we allocated the whole hundred thousand to the Port Hills spun in here just finishing and also gave a number of other fundings to things such as the Mount Vernon by the rock wall they 're going up onto Mount Vernon Trek we are very keen to see some more involvement around riparian plantings took me the trip trees coming off perhaps in the future there 's a catchment wide initiative that we 'd like to get some involvement such as the red zone here is up on the port hills perhaps it 's not to reduce some of the it 's Tiedemann coming down into the river and I understand Merlyn treats abundant criterias coming out in July and obviously lastly committees had three refreshes and and recoupment and Chris Chelios looked down and they did some amazing work and Andrew continues thank you for your support as own committee we really do appreciate it water quality of course and anything to do with biodiversity which I 'm you know about scheme from last year we would like to continue yeah I think the committee 's just getting stronger and better actually it 's got pretty cohesion good facilitation as well but I was actually going to and I think it 's a really good good uptake and he 's showing that the what we have achieved over the last year but I was going to ask the question about the my mother Lily Wells and on page 63 councillors paragraph but it does say they 're modeling his indication that nitrates may find their way to deep water Lance Lance identified himself as a community member of the zone committee so yes I 'm assuming we 're getting some technical support down [Laughter] [Music] because I think the key thing here is the deep aquifers because previously well as you know we 've upgraded our deep wall program and the Northwest they 're thinking that we would be safe by turning off air shallow walls but this is a actually considerable concern and the zone committee is Phaethon is very seriously and I 'm just wondering Leslie if you could expand on the steps were taking to move this one a 30 zone committee in order to address this yes certainly so there 's a technical briefing last month on this it was an opportunity for both committees to kick the science and click the economics and we also have our chair or a potter who is also on the Waimakariri sewing committee is very representative in terms of what the options are that 's still very much in technical work that has been going on since you last received a briefing was on those tests bills and also identifying kind of delineating where the actual source area was going to be so their next step is about now that we know there 's a particular area and the issues what are the options what are we going to do about it it 's the conversation that you 'll beginning a briefing I understand both counselors accounts of our conversations and I guess that they view the questionnaires you know how much can the zone committees do about this we can only recommend to the the Regional Council or to the house yes I think it would be useful for just a quick explanation because I think you know although this is obviously been in the public arena for for some time you know we don 't want people to misunderstand what the roles and responsibilities are so perhaps if you just speak to the the role of them the Regional Council weekend and and then community talking to the community in providing some recommendations so they set the some recommendations about time frames so how quickly can we actually move to to move landowners to reducing the nitrates coming in now obviously we 're talking about an area of land that 's not an our catchment but the impact potentially if it 's there is on our catchment in terms of the deep aquifers so indeterminate in making a determination and that regard how much weight has given to the impact on the the neighboring I mean I know that the keikain looks at a region but look people are not going to understand that the fact that one 's on one side of the boundary in terms of land use that 's allowed under a district plan that we have no say over as compared to outside where we do well not entirely but thank you very much for your report and all the work the zone committee do you referred that something you referred to there plantings on was lease and it 's in a great example of the work that your committee support and don 't what I wanted to ask you about in relation and install runoff you 've referred to I 've just got some concern that the developments that are current residential developments that are currently progressing and n will have mitigation required I 'm just wondering in your views if there is sufficient mitigation around those recent developments on Worsley Spirit in your view I don 't know what specifics but when we did do the when the process regarding putting in funding to the to the project there is down at the base of loosely spewed which then feeds into the Kashmir strengths there is a trip tree that there that my understanding is part of the subdivision in the what 's going on there flake the Eyrie limp yep they 're going to recontour that what used to be a stream it 's going to hit plantings understand and future division development that we 're still going to make a track go up the side and the gully Muir and they 're going to make sure that there is sediment controls in the natural way to stop a lot of that stuff coming down so I know that it just in terms of the winemaker Airy Wells project because the the report was excellent but this paragraph just jumped out at me and I agree with you completely that we thought this was a rabbit for thinks but it 's not a nitrate preference that it seems and obviously the deep aquifers are one of our three pillars upon which we risked our secure drinking water stairs and we never want to face an issue with them so I 'm just you talked about you knew now know now the source area of the contamination right and we know the nitrates are coming under the why Mac just how quickly could it can act on this in terms of the powers that they have they know what we plan my understanding would be late for notified next year so is there no other power that he can has or the drinking water Assessor has that could mitigate this way more quickly than that process be could it be referred up to the what what the process under the RMA that that brings it brings it to what is that the region so dead is actually already driving some of land-use change that needs to happen and it 's also driving some of the farmers to apply to a farm it can 't_''_7365.289 be four consents to plant and also found the environment plan so some of those owners is there any possibility of any faster action under something like I don 't know regeneration act or the Environmental Protection Agency [Music] bounine farmer plants and that 's great look thank you very much and I 'm in a very detailed report at some excellent thank you the last one is the bank 's financial ozone committee tena koutou katoa and happy birthday you 'll worship oh thank you so this is our annual report it 's so long ago I 've lost interest in Exxon unless you 've got efficient so skip skip straight on to what 's been going on with design committee in the last two or three months the hot topic since the ye-qing debris flow at Teddington has been the future of forestry on banks furniture and all our last two or three meetings we the last meeting we had a briefing about the new national environmental standard for plantation forestry in espl and which it turns out is quite a permissive document and we 're a bit concerned that Banks Peninsula is zoned green that means that forestry activities do not that 's a permitted act forestry is a permitted activity on Banks Peninsula so we 've been trying to catch up with what the existing rules are and the district plan and and the regional plan and in what we what we 're I think there 's a feeling of there 's own committee is that their assessment of being a green and a yellow zone probably not quite right that may be so we would like to understand better how that was reached with we understand it 's based on topography and rock but I 'm not sure how much soils the the effect of the soils was and this would be in a and issue in both these other zones to who have the same Lois soil type which is very frangible so what we are asking is that the planners work closely on amendments to various statutory instruments to ensure that the revision of the planning rules for forestry is fit for purpose for banks peninsula and will ensure that water quality will be maintained and enhanced just I 've just put this up here but I was going to suggest something else but we can 't excuse me so just note I was actually going to you know it 's sort of a agree that councils planning staff work closely excuse me with environment Canterbury 's planning staff to amend claims if necessary to ensure environment multiple in touch plantation forestry rules for banks peninsula with the National Environment statement for plantation forestry which came to effect on 1 May 2018 so that 's what we 'd like you just did and just a noting provision yes yep just highlighting the issue yeah yeah just we could just we could simply take out note the banks hunters don 't come and just put requests that the council 's planning staff work closely with environment I like that I like that yeah very significant event a card was passed from across across council base rates we do general yeah that 's fantastic new no sorry somebody had their hand up yonni thank you just in terms of previously you 've raised concern with stock being able to be on council land access in the waterways is there any update on that not that I 'm aware of I know that staff have been we someone contacted me recently you know a couple of months ago to say who was working on it asked me who and other food than to forgive them but they know quite how we 're tracking that I think we 've had a formal resolution previously who might be quite good just noted in the report what is what is 13 on the issue is that on a whole bunch of our land water and how much but in certain places where we leased land to farmers we don 't have effective stop control so the stock are able to end up in the waterways yeah but what 's the what 's the issue that we 're asking staff to report back on what progress has akuti Valley with this community group that 's working to improve water quality there and they see the stock on the esplanade reserve there 's no fence between the private land and the council 's esplanade reserve and they 're getting into the creek okay yeah okay there are places like some woods so if somebody could just write some words down it would be great Andrew yes so just just all that one I mean it might just be as simple as requesting an update from staff on what progress has been made on the messes raised regarding stock having the ability to enter the waterway as a koozie Valley like well actually it 's more than a cookie belly there are a number of these eastern a presumes about makes an entrance and I suspect it 's happening another noises too so maybe we just take out the words that it could you Valley yes regarding the example and I 'm aware that Paul Devlin was doing some work on that and I 'm just as keen as Jonnie and probably just as keen as the zone committee do it through the next chief executives report is that okay so request update from staff regarding stop entering what waterways waterways foreign council owned land from Council remained as their only happening and banks permit Tula I know it was raised this an issue that was raised by the bank 's financial ozone can I hate all right and then at the next and the next see a report well no yes if it 's been raised on public we might as well report it on public it 's just easier that way Andrew Paula Hine thanks for the report the the section of the zone committee report reducing sediment from roads I mean this is something that again has been talked about for a long time the trial which is described in the zone committee report to what extent is that joined up with priority actions 1.2 and 1.3 in the FATA or whole of harbor catchment management plan because I noticed in particular that priority action 1.3 in the catchment management plan is implementing support promote and implement learnings from an erosion and sediment control pilot project hope that this is is joined up because it looks like two very similar work streams and if it 's not then we need to make sure it is I think I think that reference and the falco to up what focal plane is actually reference to the pet project that particular project so it 's the very exciting project that the e key and staff coordinating excellent yes and the learnings from that will help inform anybody dealing with lower soils on roadside cuttings hopefully but I mean it 's only a tiny fraction of the sediment source and as I drove and today every one of our hundreds of streams on banks furniture as flowing Brown as the ones on the on the Kashmir side in round coming off will these low soil cement is pouring into the harvest and long base yes in the harbor on a day like today and I see where all of those streams in teens by the whole brown Mook that 's out there but anyway that was one place where we was highly visible that we thought we could make a taking seems to be taking a long time thank you very much and would someone like to move that we received the information that we request the second one and request that the third one as well so Andrew seconded by Phil I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much thank you very much right and now the last item on on this part of the agenda the hearings panel report to Council on the draft a couple Nicki reserve management plan and I 'd like to and that by its Mel amount I know e Deputy Chair of wanaku Runanga to join us at the table on Ric I know E as well welcome both of you Cora and I 'd like to now just hand over to the chair of the hearings panel and Ruth tuna to introduce this item thank you thank you and I 'm very pleased to have had the privilege to to chair this hearings panel made of myself councillor David East and councillor Jana Johansson and at this point panel for their high level of engagement and involvement this particular hearings panel required a reasonable level of participation there were three meetings and a site visit to the reserve as well so thank you very much indeed to the two of you for your involvement and I 'd also like to acknowledge or Nakuru now a chair Richt I know a Deputy Chair Melton airy and community board chair Pam Richardson and other members of their new COO Runanga who are here with us today excuse me it 's also important that we acknowledge the work which has got us to this point of having a plan in front of us for adoption the works involve many participants over many many years and I 'd like to particularly acknowledge the work done over the last two years developing the plan by the project team that project team apart from doing a huge amount of work in the development of the plan and including writing the draft has been a perfect manifestation of partnership equal representation from the owner corona and from the City Council and one representative from the tells the story of the development of the plan and the steps that have taken place as we 've moved towards the point we 're at today and the partnership which has really been a cornerstone of the development of the plan and is a true expression of the tech on on a relationship so to speak to the specific recommendations from the hearings panel recommendation worn formally adopting the plan is actually more significant than it might first appear this will be the first plan that we 've adopted which has been developed in true partnership with Runanga and which contains specific manner fenya values very the report and its achievement really is something to celebrate both for our new Karuna and for the city council recommendation 2 requesting that a formal application be made for national reserves act status this is obviously a process that needs to be followed but if successful this will give the Takapuna key reserve the same status as the Waitangi treaty grounds which will recognize its major cultural and national significance recommendation 3 establishing the co governance group looks to governance of the a national reserve this continues to give effect to the partnership between Runanga and council and again gives effect to the Tejano a relationship through the relationship particularly between the local Runanga and the local community board recommendation 4 relates to the immediate work that the co governance group will turn its mind to once it 's been formed recommendation 5 thanking all of those involved for the participation in the process acknowledging that many of these people have involved for many years the level of interest by the community in this reserve was evident both in the huge level of involvement in the public engagement and consultation process the number of submitters first of all submitting but then wanting to be heard the quality of the submissions and the number of community members attending the meetings of the hearings panel and certainly that last meeting in a karora was well attended both by members of the wider Banks Peninsula community and well attended by representatives of local Runanga as well and that was really good to see matters that the hearings panel had particular regard to as a result between commercialization of parts of the reserve with community expectation whilst at the same time still allowing for establishment of facilities such as visitor center visitor facilities interpretation Education Center guided walks and other educational opportunities all of which could a could assist in the aspirations of local Runanga providing employment opportunities or possibly social enterprise opportunities so this really is an important step in what 's been quite a long journey going back to at least 2008 quite possibly before that when the classification of the land was changed to historic reserve status with strong public support at that time for the change and thanks to my colleague Jana Johansson for providing us nothing it 's been circulated to all council as just this morning with the details of the meeting where that matter was considered chaired by former Banks Peninsula deputy mayor and then a corollary a community board chair Stuart Miller and this shows that consideration of these matters has been ongoing for some time have involved a large number of participants not all of whom are still involved but many of whom will still retain a we 're looking at today it 's important that the contribution of everybody who 's been part of the journey to this point is acknowledged it 's a journey of meaningful partnership and today we 've got an opportunity to acknowledge the importance of the Special Reserve and is extremely important cultural significance it 's also important that we take the opportunity today to celebrate the collaborative way that we 've worked together in a true partnership to reach the point of having the plan in front of us today for adoption and finally in another manifestation of the way that the partnership is very much alive and well and very genuine one of the conversations which has occurred between the final meeting of the hearings panel and sedation today 's adoption meeting has been around the value and the appropriateness of manner of federal representation on hearings panel and at this point I 'd note that Christine Wilson was originally to be appointed to the panel and would have given effect to this type of representation but unfortunately was unable to participate due to sickness when she was replaced panel in this regard were not explicitly taken into account this has given rise to what really has been a good quality conversation between council staff and Anoka Runanga since the first since the final meeting of the hearings panel and as a result of those conversations I 've got an additional recommendation that I 'd like to add the wording of which I think has already been provided six requests to report to the council meeting on the 5th of July on how council can ensure it has appropriate ruling a representation on hearings panels where matters of significance to manifest are being heard so it 's good that the conversation that 's been able to occur since the final meeting of the hearings panel has given rise to a resolution that will inform other good processes in future and that we 've been able to take this example to give effect to the concerns or what originally were concerns from Runanga which we 're now able to take on board in this way so thank you for the opportunity to do that and thank you very much the know if you would like to make a presentation on behalf of the

the last two years and they know what they really want to be able to think that the worked so hard on this management plan and and Russell for your patience and loving attendance to us and we wanted to share with you really around Takapuna ki a a piece of other FINA one know I 've grown up as a very privileged young molecule on my fin away and I mean I 've known nothing more than pride of place know my father was so he really adored his environment and he he knew every rock he knew every Hill he knew every cow in his earlier and has nearly a life and and he taught this to us through the strength of my Toller my toll was a very important part of our farm a and and she was definitely that the mentor but she she grew in a time of grievance she lived at a time three months so you never really know grievance until you agreements of phenol far no identity until you have traveled in a car from a koala coup which we called the kite in and we have traveled with my Toa we would always pay tribute to dr. Wernicke we and whenever whenever asked her and she never told us but you definitely knew with that tear rolling down her eye on top of Bernanke was meaningful and so we never talked about this she never talked about the blood of our ancestors they had been sheared on Takapuna key she never talked about our to pin a thinner one but she would mentioned three words no she often uttered three words to us which was monthly one month there were you know and Martha WA has told us that the venerable tell us sometime when it was ready to heal them on that the sadness the hurt you know Makawao told us that we would know when it was time and that was not the time because the do it was really strong with them when taller and taller as a grandparent of you if you didn 't know the word but it was very strong within her so now it 's that time we know that month you were has come to fortune and that we are able to to heal that way and as I relate it condition of treatment and now you 've that bearing that that road of recovery that is what is happening but dr. Bruner key dr. Winnik is in that time of real healing in 2000 and I 'm glad that you mentioned it today so in 2000 I I except my family up to Ellington to where I worked on the way he 'd double registration not the Copernican it has dark places trust as we were on there and I 'm here in this moment to vote tree important that cannot hit data for their support and their guidance for me to be able to complete this wahid up through registration at their time and it was two and a half years of of great work but the air I got to learn a lot about who I was this was the greatest influence of research I hadn 't even been involved in so I got to learn a lot about who I was but I also was really confronted with some of they they their levels of of torment that their Takapuna had gone through such as the rubbish us but but besides from there it took us on an amazing journey to get us to where we are today so this is where we are today among koalas right here you know um you know I feel honored I do feel honored that my they might a puppet takes me back to to such a place as the kupuna key and I can feel the and the future on the horizon you know the demands of us to survive in the past and not the demands of us to allow us to thrive today and the connection that I have to Takapuna key is nothing compared to the connection that our next generation one that I brought with me and that they will have to miss Finn away because they don 't have the same grievances as we have know that they have connection to the Finn a well but also to their own identity so I mean they are stronger they are wiser and they are more equipped to take on the future and I 've really brought up with me a and thanks to the farmer the listen Englishman plane this this has been a real partnership that has been a treaty promised no this is a promise of the treaty that we have really played out there has been no word discussed about us without us and on that is so important so I really want to entrust this amazing management plan over to you and with your with the trust of your commitment to the to the Ramona into the monofin aware that you understand that the significance of this beautiful place of Dhaka Prima key not only to us as mammoth were to us as a greater nation and that you and you really honor the greater purpose of our future as I do at the Manor India code Ricardo de nada content another good dinner and God God [Music] [Music] rest up yeah look I just want to just say a couple of words and that was an incredibly incredibly powerful presentation i III have felt really moved by the expression of utter ha and the strength that has been brought to the table by the partnership that this represents and a elements protection against those things that have appeared in the past and also protection as we go forward and to a new future together so it really does represent something pretty special so thank you very much on behalf of the city of Christchurch and being financially because we represent the peninsula as well and it really has been an honor and a privilege to have you at the table as we consider adopting this resolution so I will stop speaking and sit down because we have a technical process now it 'll go through so obviously Andrew you 'd like to move the resolution and who would like to second the resolution I 'd take eonni Johansson now is there any debate on it young yes please thank you well I have to say as a newly elected councillor in 2008 I was privileged to be asked to go to a hearing petal over on the peninsula in the old gaiety before had been appeared and it was probably so forth beneath and um it was probably one of the most underestimated moments of my short political career because submitters in regards to Takapuna key the request was that we turn it into a historic reserve and it was really overwhelming to see the significance of that site and to really comprehend how important it was and that was the start of my journey with Takapuna key I just wanted to just quickly very quickly reflect on that and just acknowledge to two people in particular although there have been many more people involved for a huge number of years on this but from that hearing in 2008 which led to the development of a conservation report which we 've got and now today the management plan I just want to acknowledge Jorge Tico who really started the the submissions on that day and the strength and the passion with which he impressed upon us the importance of the site so really wanted to acknowledge Jorge and one thing that he put in his submission which was reference to historian Harry Everson and I just thought it was important to acknowledge unfortunately back then he he couldn 't attend the hearing but he had written a pretty powerful letter what Harry has written we agree with so I mean that that was really nice and you know in in concluding that hearing on that day when we were summing up one of the other comments that um George Tikal made which obviously this was before the earthquake he pointed out that had taken a long time to get to this point and that another 10 or 12 years or 20 years was not the issue as long as it happens but the sooner the better and obviously it 's ten years on from that that first Hearing Panel but obviously we 've had the earthquake and a lot of pressure on our resources but I think the the significant things that have happened since then are the work that 's been done around the ekor our wastewater treatment that was certainly a really important point that we are addressing as a council was the formulation of the conservation report and was also the development of the management plan which we 're we 're concluding today of course there 's still more work to be done and that is approaching and you know I I 'm not quite sure what that process is but it is important that we do support that process with with the appropriate level of resourcing so I just wanted to just very quickly in conclusion just read from the actual the Hearing Panel proposal up from that day because I think the words actually sum up quite nicely the the reflection of coming together to support what is a really important piece of land and and part of this it 's a really important story actually it 's not the piece of land it 's also the story that goes with it that is incredibly important and so and again I know my former colleague well my council colleague is a knowledge formula former councillor Claudia Reed and also Stuart Miller who on that Hearing Panel but though he 's presenting submissions to the panel unanimously supported it the submitters urged the council to pursue the case to learn to become a National Historic Reserve and in due course move the echo road wastewater treatment works away from Tucker Benecke the ekor away River Community significance of the issues raised by submitters and further reflected that the occasion of the hearing had been one of great dignity backed by a highly committed community who brought forward the results of work by many people over many years and I just think you know it 's really important to acknowledge that this has been an incredibly long painful journey but that we 're making progress and we acknowledge all those people far too many to name in person today who have contributed and we move forward so I 'm really proud to stand here and move this forward today I do too want to acknowledge all the people that have been involved without naming all of them specifically and just to really look forward to that next stage one of the really important and the Hearing Panel recommendation today though just to sum up is that we 're setting up a co governance group the hearing spent on I think deliberated around the acknowledgement that resources need to go into ensuring that the things we say we 're going to do in the management plan can happen priorities and ever process by which those things can progress I 'm really optimistic it 's not going to take another ten years to get further progress but as has been said you know it 's better that happens sooner rather than later and I think this is a real good step along that journey so thank you to everyone that 's been involved it down I just wanted to quickly acknowledge your words they were incredibly grounding and I think it 's a good time to remember our history of New Zealand where we have come from and where we 've come from together there 's a lot of things and a lot of hurt in our country that still needs to be resolved and these things that we 're going through right now are actually those things that are going to resolve that so that the next generation can actually truly work together and actually be that multi-or that bicultural country that embraces a multicultural future because I actually believe that is how we will probably be the best little country in the world your your words really year ago in two days I was up at home at Patti haka where we went through a similar process with the crown apology and we 're going through the reconciliation act at government at the moment and I do remember the stories of my elders telling us about what happened at home and I know there 's a lot of connection with with exponential or in down our popper as well and it was really moving really moving and I think we all as New Zealanders need to know where we 've come from it is something that I find a disgrace that you ask people about what happened in New Zealand only 150 years ago nobody really knows and I think this is a great step for locally to actually start telling the stories but not telling it in a way to start opening up the hood but actually to really heal and actually to go we 've moved on so much from then and we are actually moving on together and so I thank you for your story and I 've really encouraged more of us to to where we can go so thank you thank you and to close thank you I think um this morning has been a particularly poignant moment I 'd I referred to the journey of the the development of the plan earlier and there are different people that have been part of that journey as its various different stages but I I love the fact and and really want to just sort of take a moment to stop and you know really really acknowledge the fact that we 've taken this opportunity today to to acknowledge the past to be thankful for the people that have been involved in developing the plan to bring it to this point and to celebrate the the partnership and the strength of relationships which has brought us to the point that we 're at today where we 've got a development plan that we 're able to a management plan that we 're able to adopt but really I think from all of the comments that have been made today show confidence and being able to look forward with confidence to the future and the this has has been said we know that the future for our children not only rights some of the wrongs of the past but is something that we can all look forward to and I really just want to acknowledge all of the words that have been said this morning and clearly the the passion and the involvement of all of the people that have got us to the point that we 're at today and it gives me a huge amount of pleasure to be able to move what really is a significance and feud and hugely important some resolution this morning to put it in our council terms but a significant and important point on the journey that recognizes the the cultural significance of this very important piece of land thank you so the motion has been moved and seconded and I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's Kerry thank you very much I 'd like to move the resolution in front of us and that Steve Clark remained for the first of the PX items do I that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it is Carrie you _"

    "text": "very much right and now the last item on on this part of the agenda the hearings panel report to Council on the draft stock up Nicki reserve management plan and I 'd like to and that buy it smell mount I know a Deputy Chair of wanaku Runanga to join us at the table on Ric I know II as well welcome both of you Kira and I 'd like to now just hand over to the chair of the hearings panel and Ruth tuna to introduce this item thank you thank you and I 'm very pleased to have had the privilege to to chair this hearings panel made of myself councillor David east and councillor Jana Johansson and at this point I 'd like to thank the members of the hearings panel for their high level of engagement and involvement this particular hearings panel required a reasonable level of participation there were three meetings and a site visit to the reserve as well so thank you very much indeed to the two of you for your involvement and I 'd also like to acknowledge or Nuka Runanga board chair Pam Richardson and other members of their new cool Runanga who are here with us today excuse me it 's also important that we acknowledge the work which has got us to this point of having a plan in front of us for adoption the works involve many participants over many many years and I 'd like to particularly acknowledge the work done over the last two years developing the plan by the project team that project team apart from doing a huge amount of work in the development of the plan and including writing the draft has been a perfect manifestation of partnership equal representation from the owner corona and from the City Council and one representative from the community board and section 4 of our report today really tells the story of the development of the plan and the steps that have taken place as we 've moved towards the point we 're at today under partnership which has really been a cornerstone of the development of the plan and is a true expression of the taken on a relationship so to speak to the specific plan is actually more significant than it might first appear this will be the first plan that we 've adopted which has been developed in true partnership with Runanga and which contains specific manner phenol values very the report and its achievement really is something to celebrate both for a new Karuna and for the City Council recommendation to requesting that a formal application be made for national reserves Act status this is obviously a process that needs to be followed but if successful this will give the Takapuna key reserve the same status as the Waitangi treaty grounds which will recognize its major cultural and national significance recommendation 3 establishing the co governance group looks to governance of the reserve in the immediate future until the reserve is declared a national reserve this continues to give effect to the partnership between Runanga and council and again gives effect to the Tejano a relationship through the relationship particularly between the local Runanga and the local community board recommendation 4 relates to the immediate work that the co governance group will turn its mind to once it 's been formed recommendation the process acknowledging that many of these people have involved for many years the level of interest by the local community in this reserve was evident both in the huge level of involvement in the public engagement and consultation process the number of submitters first of all submitting but then wanting to be heard the quality of the submissions and the number of community members attending the meetings of the hearings panel and certainly that last meeting in a karora was well attended both by members of the wider Banks Peninsula community and well attended by representatives of local Runanga as well and that was really good to say matters that the hearings panel had particular regard to as a result of submissions we 're traffic effects car parking finding the balance between commercialization of parts of the reserve with community expectation whilst at the same time still allowing for establishment of facilities such as visitor center visitor facilities interpretation Education Center guided walks and other educational opportunities all of which could a could assist in the aspirations of local Runanga providing employment opportunities or possibly social enterprise opportunities so quite a long journey going back to at least 2008 quite possibly before that when the classification of the land was changed to historic reserve status with strong public support at that time for the change and thanks to my colleague Jana Johansson for providing us nothing it 's been circulated to all council as just this morning with the details of the meeting where that matter was considered chaired by former banks peninsular deputy mayor and then akaroa River Community Board Chair Stuart Miller and this shows that consideration of these matters has been ongoing for some time have involved a large number of participants not all of whom are still involved but many of whom will still retain a very strong interest in the adoption of the plan that we 're looking at today it 's important that the contribution of everybody who 's been part of the journey to this point is acknowledged it 's a journey of meaningful partnership and today we 've got an opportunity to acknowledge the importance of the special reserve and it 's extremely important cultural significance it 's also important that that we 've worked together in a true partnership to reach the point of having the plan in front of us today for adoption and finally in another manifestation of the way that the partnership is very much alive and well and very genuine one of the conversations which has occurred between the final meeting of the hearings panel and today should today 's adoption meeting has been around the value and the appropriateness of manner of federal representation on hearings panel and at this point I 'd note that Chris Wilson was originally to be appointed to the panel and would have given effect to this type of representation but unfortunately was unable to participate due to sickness when she was replaced the particular attributes that Christine would have brought to the panel in this regard were not explicitly taken into account this has given rise to what really has been a good quality conversation between council staff and Anoka Runanga since the first since the final meeting of the hearings panel and as a result of those conversations I 've got an additional recommendation that I 'd like been provided six requests to report to the council meeting on the 5th of July on how council can ensure it has appropriate running a representation on hearings panels where matters of significance to men offend you are being heard so it 's good that the conversation that 's been able to occur since the final meeting of the hearings panel has given rise to a resolution that will inform other good processes in future and that we 've been able to take this example to give effect to the concerns or what originally were concerns from Runanga which we 're now able to take on board in this way so thank you for the opportunity to do that and thank you very much the Basil 's done now I 'd like to invite you know if you would like to make a presentation on behalf of the Runanga think America Rockets you pocono taro root erectus hippo hippo hair they are there the hey Mario then a tomato

very important part of our farm a and and she was definitely that the mentor that she she grew in a time of grievance she lived an entire life of Breeland so you never really know grievance until you agreements of FINA wa far no identity until you have traveled in a car from up north to Onuaku which we called the pike in and we have traveled with my taller we would always pay tribute to Dhaka pinaki we always had you always had a moment of silence whenever whenever asked her she never told us but you definitely knew was that tear rolling down her either dr. blinky was meaningful and so we never talked about this she never talked about the blood of our ancestors they had been sheared on Takapuna key she never talked about her tupa a thinner one but she wouldn 't mentioned three words no she often uttered three words to us which was month in told us that the vanilla would tell us sometime when it was ready to heal the mind that the sadness the hurt you know Marty were told us that we would know when it was time and that was not the time because that was really strong with them when taller and taller as a grandparent of you if you didn 't know the word but it was very strong within her so now it 's that time we know that Martha were has come to fortune and that we are able to heal that mummy and I relate it to very much a someone being in a really critical condition of treatment and now you have that bearing that that road of recovery that is what is happening but dr. Bruner key dr. Bruner key is in that time of real healing in 2000 and I 'm glad that you mentioned it today so in 2000 I I except my family up to a leader to where I worked on the wahid Dublin registration not the Copernican it has dark places trust as we were on there and I that can I hit data for their support and their guidance for me to be able to complete this wahid up through registration at their time and it was two and a half years of great work but the air I got to learn a lot about who I was this was the greatest influence of research I hadn 't even been involved in so I got to learn a lot about who I was but I also was really confronted with some of they they their levels of of torment that their Takapuna had gone through such as the rubbish dump and the sewers was very confronting very confronting to us but but besides from there it took us on an on an amazing journey to get us to where we are today so this is where we are today in my koalas right here you know um you know I feel honored I do feel honored bit my they might a puppet takes me back to to such a place as Takapuna key and I can feel the and the future on the horizon you know the demands demands of us to allow us to thrive today and the connection that I have to talk opener key is nothing compared to the connection that our next generation one that I brought with me and that they will have to this phenol because they don 't have the same grievances as we have know that they have connection to the phenol but also to their own identity so um they are stronger they are wiser and they are more equipped to take on the future um I 've really brought up with me a um and thanks to the farmer behind me a quarter 2 to signify this partnership that has happened over this village when playing this this has been a real partnership that has been a treaty promise no this is a promise of the treaty that we have really played out there has been no word discussed about us without us and on that is so important so I really want to entrust this amazing management plan over to you and with your with the trust of your commitment to the to the Ramona into the beautiful place of Dhaka Prima key not only to us as manaphy newer to us as a greater nation and that you you really honor the greater purpose of our future Ida met the men in keener India go Ducato dinara content another go 13 are ago Delgado gotcha get away [Music] yeah look I just want to just say a couple of words and that was an incredibly incredibly powerful presentation i III have felt really moved by the expression of utter ha and the strength that has been brought to the table by the partnership that this represents and a quarter way there 's a perfect way to offer protection against the elements protection against those things that have occurred in the past and also protection as we go forward and to a new future together so it really does represent something pretty special so thank you very much on behalf of the city of Christchurch and Banks Peninsula because we represent the peninsula as well and it really has been an honor and a privilege to have you at the table as we consider adopting this resolution have a technical process now it 'll go through so obviously Andrew you 'd like to move the resolution and who would like to second the resolution I 'd take Yanni Johansson now is there any debate on it Yanni yes please thank you well I have to say as a newly elected councillor in 2008 I was privileged to be asked to go to a hearing pedal over on the peninsula in the old gaiety before had been appeared and it was probably so beneath it and um it was probably one of the most underestimated moments of my short political career because we don 't arrived at the Gaiety and saw the submission the submitters in regards to Takapuna key the request was that we turn it into a historic reserve and it was really overwhelming to see the significance of that site and to really comprehend how important it was and that was the start of my journey with Takapuna key I just wanted to just quickly very quickly reflect on that and just acknowledge to two people in particular although there have been many more people from that hearing in 2008 which led to the development of a conservation report which we 've got and now today the management plan I just want to acknowledge Jorge Tico who really started the the submissions on that day and the strength and the passion with which he impressed upon us the importance of this site so really wanted to acknowledge Jorge and one thing that he put in his submission which was reference to historian Harry Everson and I just thought it was important to acknowledge unfortunately back then he he couldn 't attend the hearing but he had written a pretty powerful letter to us as a hearings panel and George Bailey said what Harry has written we agree with so I mean that that was really nice and you know in in concluding that hearing on that day when we were summing up one of the other comments that um George Tikal made which obviously this was before the earthquake he pointed out that had taken a long time to get to this point and that another 10 or 12 years or 20 years was not the better and obviously it 's ten years on from that that first Hearing Panel but obviously we 've had the earthquake and a lot of pressure on our resources but I think the the significant things that have happened since then are the work that 's been Akua wastewater treatment that was certainly a really important point that we are addressing as a council was the formulation of the conservation report and was also the development of the management plan which we 're we 're concluding today of course there 's still more work to be done and that is approaching central government over the classification of the national reserve status and you know I 'm not quite sure what that process is but it is important that we do support that process with with the appropriate level of resourcing so I just wanted to just very quickly in conclusion just read from the actual the Hearing Panel proposal up from that day because I think the words actually sum up quite nicely the the reflection of coming together to support what is a really important piece of land story actually it 's not the piece of land it 's also the story that goes with it that is incredibly important and so and again I know my former colleague well my council colleague is a knowledge formula former councillor Claudia Reed and also Stuart Miller who on that hearing panel but those presenting submissions the panel unanimously supported it the submitters urged the council to pursue the case of land to become a National Historic Reserve and in due course move the ekor or waste water treatment works away from tacit Benecke the ekor Iowa River Community Board minutes recorded that the Hearing Panel noted the immense significance of the issues raised by submitters and further reflected that the occasion of the hearing had been one of great dignity backed by a highly committed community who brought forward the results of work by many people over many years and I just think you know it 's really important to acknowledge that this has been an incredibly long painful journey but that we 're making progress and we acknowledge all those people far too many to name in person 'm really proud to stand here and move this forward today I due to want to acknowledge all the people that have been involved without naming all of them specifically and just to really look forward to that next stage one of the really important things in the Hearing Panel recommendation today though just to sum up is that we 're setting up a co governance group the hearings panel I think deliberated around the acknowledgement that resources need to go into ensuring that the things we say we 're going to do in the management plan can happen so it 's really important that we do identify those priorities and have a process by which those things can progress I 'm really optimistic it 's not gonna take another ten years to get further progress but as is being said you know it 's better that happen sooner rather than later and I think this is a real good step along that journey so thank you to everyone that 's been involved it down I just wanted to quickly acknowledge your words they were incredibly grounding and I think New Zealand where we have come from and where we 've come from together there 's a lot of things and a lot of hurt in our country that still needs to be resolved and these things that we 're going through right now are actually those things that are going to resolve that so that the next generation can actually truly work together and actually be that multi or that bicultural country that embraces a multicultural future because I actually believe that is how we will probably be the best little country in the world your your words really really did touch me because a year ago actually a year ago in two days I was up at home at petty haka where we went through a similar process with the crown apology and we 're going through the reconciliation act at government at the moment and I do remember the stories of my elders telling us about what happened at home and I know there 's a lot of connection with with Banks Peninsula and our our pupper as well and it was really moving really moving and where we 've come from it is something that I find a disgrace that you ask people about what happened in New Zealand only 150 years ago nobody really knows and I think this is a great step for locally to actually start telling the stories but not telling it in a way to start opening up the hood but actually to really heal and actually to go we 've moved on so much from then and we are actually moving on together and so I thank you for your story and I 've really encouraged more of us to start telling those and actually looking at the positive side to where we can go so thank you and to close thank you I think come this morning has been a particularly poignant moment I 'd I referred to the journey of the the development of the plan earlier and there are different people that have been part of that journey as its various different stages but I love the fact and really want to just sort of take a moment to stop and you know really really acknowledge the acknowledge the past to be thankful for the people that have been involved in developing the plan to bring it to this point and to celebrate the the partnership and the strength of relationships which has brought us to the point that we 're at today where we 've got a development plan that we 're able to a management plan that we 're able to adopt but really I think from all of the comments that have been made today show confidence and been able to look forward with confidence to the future and the delivery of all of the aspirations in this plan so this has has been said we know that the future for our children not only rights some of the wrongs of the past but is something that we can all look for and I really just want to acknowledge all of the words that have been said this morning and clearly the the passion and the involvement of all of the people that have got us to the point that we 're at today and it gives me a huge amount of pleasure to feud and hugely important some resolution this morning to put it in our council terms but a significant and important point on the journey that recognizes the the cultural significance of this very important piece of

tubes are kind of consenting the other highlight for the year was here nearly 2.7 million of the government 's money the the freshwater Improvement Fund was allocated to projects that now Zone in one of them was actually directly to address the water shortage in the seven river so from the CPW stage to pipe that runs across under the river we 've taken a bit of water from there we 'll put an you like so they won 't run dry again and would be taking water from the you know in the off season when the farmers aren 't using it for irrigation and of course you know it 's probably one of a few that actually managed to spend there or immediate steps money and the 100,000 and flashy so basically speeding Hanneman 100,000 TV single year in the last 70 years now in other zones are here struggling to spin Deus they spent all from me you got an increase in to you and ask sorry about that I was just so trekking on to the banks but in Chile 's own committee but we so we 're getting we 're getting some wording together that wall that we can resolve there does anyone have any questions for Ellen green I just need to be careful not to make generalizations but you just sit before so what and Reich in the cell and River so you 're seeking to you know give effective recharge when farmers are using it again during that so CPW water I guess the you know only use it to irrigate their land in the summer months so if it was gonna be a dry one too if we know that you know there hasn 't been enough recharge during those joven that period we can put water into the ground the essentially kind of keep the buffed up for if you like because you know this is just a huge amount of water underneath the plains right if there hasn 't been recharged here for a few years in the road take on nothing you know the rivers gonna run dry again with this project you know we can keep keep the bathtub topped up and so we never there 's any kind of more water you know it 'll just come out in the rivers and springs and lower planes yeah we know that farming sectors feeling picked on so I just wanted to make sure you know are we making great elite to say it 's due to oh they speak to farming such as irrigation it 's due to both due to an extraction univibe butter farmers and it 's also due year you might get about twenty five cubics of recharge and the farmers will take part of it and part of it kind of goes down see ya do you know how much of the 25 they take okay team of the reach outside over yeah don 't quote me on that one all right okay thank you okay good Oh David sorry actually last year and as a consequence of stages of that war straightening up more sustainable yeah that 's correct piston teeth of the CPW skin to us to retire some that groundwater so that walk and stay in the in the ground I wasn 't gonna raise the central plains but I 'm not I 'm not allowing it comment to go and charge could you explain to me please the the additional water irrigation central plains water I 'm assuming that makes dairy farming in that area more economically viable I think it gives it more certainty hmm yeah so I don 't know about the viability part of it and not on to those figures and what about does your board or is that nitrates under the why mech and I know it 's something that we smell from my phone your board doesn 't touch on that at all okay and yep just um I want to thank you and the committee for the amazing work that you do out there I think you 've got fantastic engagement with the community it 's a very difficult issue often I particularly enjoyed the other day hearing about the people that are working with the farmers from Fonterra to to raise the standards of practice have you got two or three points that you could make in terms to us in terms of the improvement that 's being seen and the practice of some of the during famine yes sir that 's happening all the time I guess there 's been quite a bit of talk about you know moving farmers to different farming systems and so on but it 's got to be lead with research you know you can expect a family to kind of make changes and this they know what those changes are effective and yes I guess you know they so there 's actually a whole lot of research been done not just in theory but and all sectors and a lot of improvement has already been made in farming systems are changing and it hasn 't actually been that long in essence to this issue in some ways would it be appropriate for you to include in your next report some of the things that we learned about from the Fonterra people that are working with the famine yes so we did actually ask for the information as well their you know their heaviness you 've got all the details it either things are just moving very quickly so we will be looking for those coming numbers we are we interested in that ourselves and so if there 's a disinterest here I 'll try to bring someone those numbers back for the next report excellent thank you very much now I 'm not sure which committee would like to report next in a report there will be a we 're of the phrase eternity eternity eternity and one of the things for our zone committee is there is achieve in 2017 and going forward as well there 's a lot of good work being done as you can see any report and we like sir one have also spent all of our allocated funds for the immediate steps one of those was the whole this year just finishing we speed it all sorry allocated rule to the Port Hills recovery up onwards with spear to assist with plantings and putting in some pest control fencing because it 's an unprecedented event obviously and if we can give an opportunity to put a lot of biodiversity back into the urine and help stop the loads coming down into the heat get Apollo we thought that it was a great way to be involved we hope that can be taken further you 'll see it was certainly report there is a another initiative that we have been involved with which was started by one of our committee members which is around the copper brake pad issue and raising the awareness of how much copper is going into the storm water system and I understand the mere in the became achievement Environment regarding a complex issue we also just designed a postcard that is going to be passed out that sort of highlights addition to the community as well so that they can be aware there is an alternative to the current bad kids so it 's it 's ongoing I know that the theory was raised groundwater sub sub group has been inserted into an identifying the groundwater protection area and making sure what 's shown on the maps is actually what has been done they did a lot of great work and it is our intention this month to hold a workshop around the way my career and I understand yourselves and he can I get him some updates tomorrow we are getting our one in two weeks as well and some of the other zone committee members attended barnum yesterday is something else that is important to our zone committee and we as a simply allocated the whole hundred thousand to the port hills financial year just finishing and also gave a number of other fundings to things such as the Mount Vernon by the rock wall they keen to see some more involvement around riparian plantings typically the troop trees coming off the port hills because again we 're looking at something perhaps in the future as a catchment wide initiative that we would like to get some involvement such as the red zone here is up on the port hills to reduce some of the experiment coming down into the river and I understand that military 's fund criterias coming out in July and obviously committee lastly committees had three refreshes and Andrew Collins and Chris Chelios stood down and that did some amazing work and Andrew continues to so just like publicly thank you for your support as I 'm committing we really do appreciate it and anything you can do to help waterways our water quality of course and anything to do with biodiversity which I 'm you know about the new NACA scheme from last year we would like to continue yeah but I think the committee is just getting stronger and beter actually it 's got food cohesion a good facilitation as well but I was actually going to and I think showing the what we have achieved over the last year but I was going to ask the question about the my mother Gary Wells and on page 63 councillors you 'll see that 's just noted there in a small paragraph that us say they 're modeling his indication they 're nitrates may find their way to deep groundwater but I think the modeling shows it is well the testing has showed that it is Lance Lance identified himself as a community member of the zone committee so yes I 'm assuming we 're getting some technical cuz I think the key thing here is the deep aquifers because previously well as you know we 've upgraded our deep wall program and the Northwest they 're thinking that we would be safe by turning off our shallow walls but this is a actually considerable concern and the zone committee is taking this very seriously and I 'm just wondering Leslie if you could expand on the steps were taking to move this why Matthew T zone committee in order to address this yes certainly so technical briefing last month on the science and kick the economics and we also hear their cheer or a patter who 's also on the Waimakariri sewing committee is very representative in terms of what the options are it 's still very much in discussion how do we deal with this particular issue the technical work that has been going on since you last received a briefing was on those tea spells in so identifying kind of delineating where the actual source area was going to be so that next step is about now that we know this particular area and the issues one of the options it 's the conversation that you 'll beginning of briefing I understand both counselor counselor conversations and I guess that the through the questionnaire is you know how much can the zone committees do about this we can only recommend to the the Regional Council to the house yes I think it would be useful for just a quickie explanation because I think you know although this is obviously been in the public arena for for some time you know we don 't want people to misunderstand what speak to the the role of them the Regional Council weekend and and then how the community feeds into talking to the communities in providing some recommendations so they said the kind of direction of travel and and also be seeking to some recommendations about timeframes so how quickly can we actually move to to move landowners to reducing the nitrates now obviously we 're talking about an area of land that 's not an our catchment but the impact potentially if it 's there is on our catchment in terms of the deep aquifers so an indeterminate in making a determination and that regard how much weight has given to the impact on the the neighboring I mean I know that the keikain looks at a region but look people are not going to understand that the fact that one 's on one side of the boundary in terms of land use that 's allowed under a district plan that we have no say over is compared to outside where we do well not dirty but thank you very much for your report and all the work the is there plantings on was lease and it 's in a great example of the work for your committee support and don 't what I want to ask you about in relation to Worsley spear was the the whole issue of runoff and install runoff that you 've referred to I 've just got some concern that the developments that residential developments that are currently progressing and and will have mitigation required I 'm just wondering in your view if there is sufficient mitigation around those recent developments on Worsley Spirit in your view I don 't know what the specifics when we did do the when they process regarding putting in funding to the to the project there is down at the base of loosely spoon which then feeds into the Kashmere stream there is a tree that there that my understanding is part of the subdivision in the what 's going on there slightly eerie them yep they 're going to recontour that what used to be a stream it 's going to hit plantings and stand and future division development they 're also going to make track go to make sure that there is sediment controls in the natural way to stop a lot of that stuff coming down but so I know that it 's been discussed those pills okay thanks Lance I 'm so picky just in terms of the way McCrory wells project because the report was excellent but this paragraph just jumped out at me and I agree with you completely that we thought this was a rabbit for thinks but that 's not a nitrate preference that it seems and obviously the deep aquifers so one of our three pillars upon which we risked our secure drinking water status and we never want to face an issue with them but so I 'm just you talked about you knew now know now the source area of the contamination right and we know the nitrates are coming under the why Mac just how quickly could he can act on this in terms of the powers that they have they know what we are planning process we are expecting plan my understanding would be late for notified its you understand planning processes take some time or the drinking water Assessor has that could mitigate this way more quickly than that process but B could it be referred up to the what what the process under the RMA that that brings it brings it to what is that the EPA is it that bring some good management practice across the region so dead is actually already driving some of land-use change that needs to happen and it 's also driving some of the farmers to apply to the farm it can 't be for consents to farm and also found the environment plan so some of those owners will be is there any possibility of any faster action under something like I don 't know regeneration act or the Environmental Protection Agency [Music] Firmin farmer plants and that 's great look thank you very much and I mean a very very detailed report of some excellent thank you the last one is the bank 's financial zone committee tena koe Jakarta and happy birthday your worship oh thank you so this is our annual report it 's so long ago I lost interest in it so to what 's been going on with design committee in the last two or three months the hot topics since the ye-qing debris flow at Teddington has been the future of forestry on banks furniture and all our last two or three meetings we 've discussed that in one form or another and at the last meeting we had a briefing about the new national environmental standard for plantation forestry in espl and which it turns out is quite a permissive document and we 're a bit concerned that banks peninsula is zoned green that means that forestry activities do not that 's a permitted Act forestry is a permitted activity on Banks Peninsula so we 've been trying to catch up with what the existing rules are and the District Planning and the regional plan and in what we what we 're I think there 's a feeling of there 's own committee is that their assessment of being a green and a yellow zone probably not quite right that may be so we would like to understand better how that was reached with we understand it 's based much soils the the effect of the soils was and this would be in a and issue in both these other zones to who have the same Lois soil type which is very frangible so what we are asking is that the planners from Christchurch City Council and the planners from Environment Canterbury work closely on amendments to various statutory instruments to ensure that the revision of the planning rules for forestry is fit for purpose for Banks Peninsula and will ensure that water quality will be maintained and enhanced just I 've just put this up here but I was going to suggest something else but we can 't excuse me so just note I was actually going to you know it 's sort of a agree that councils planning staff work closely excuse me with environment Canterbury 's planning staff to amend cleans if necessary to ensure alignment of clean touch plantation forestry rules for Banks Peninsula with the National Environment statement for plantation forestry which came to effect on 1 May 2018 so that 's what we 'd like you just did and just a noting provision could just we could simply take out note the banks hunters oh can I just put requests that the council 's planning staff work closely with environment I like that I like that yeah very significant event a card was passed from a planning staff member to another planning staff member right from across across council base rates we if do general yeah that 's fantastic news no sorry somebody had their hand up yonni thank you just in terms of previously you 've raised concern with stock being able to be on council land accessing the waterways is there any update on that not that I 'm aware of I know that staff have been we someone contacted me recently you know a couple of months ago to say who was working on it asked me but they know quite how we 're tracking that I think we 've had a formal resolution previously who might be quite good just so it 's in the report so what is what is there on the issue is that on a whole bunch of our land well I don 't know to farmers we don 't have effective stock control so the stock are able to end up in the waterways yeah but what 's the what 's the issue that we 're asking staff to report back on well what progress has made on that issue it 's particularly an issue on akuti Valley with this community group that 's working to improve water quality there and they see the stock on the esplanade reserve there 's no fence between private land and the council 's estimate I 've reserved and they 're getting into the cream okay yeah okay last place like some woods so if somebody could just write some words down it would be great Andrew yeah so just just on that one I mean it might just be as simple as requesting an update from staff on what progress has been made on the messes raised regarding stock having the ability to enter the waterway at akuti Valley like well actually it 's more than a cookie belly there are a number of these Eastern I presume survivor makes an answer and I suspect it 's the words that are cookie Valley yes Paul Devlin was doing some work on that and I 'm just as keen as Jonnie and probably just as keen as the zone committee to know where that is present good could we just do it through the next chief executives report is that okay so request update from staff regarding stop entering what waterways waterways form Council and layer on council I mean is that only happening on banks peninsula the I know that was raised this an issue that was raised by the Banks Peninsula zone can I hate all right and then at the next and the next see a report well know it 's been raised on public we might as well report it on public it 's just easier that way Andrew Paula Hein thanks for the report the the section of the zone committee report reducing sediment from roads I mean this is something that again has been talked about for a long time the trial which is described in the zone committee report to what extent is that joined up with priority actions 1.2 and because I noticed in particular that priority action 1.3 in the catchment management plan is implementing support promote and implement learnings from an erosion and sediment control pilot project on littles and have a base and roadside cuttings so I would hope that this is is joined up because it looks like two very similar work streams and if it 's not then we need to make sure it is I think I think that reference in the oh up what for our plane is actually reference to the vet project that particular project so it 's the very exciting project that the e K and staff at coordinating excellence yes and the learnings from that will help inform anybody dealing with lower soils on roadside cuttings hopefully but I mean that 's only a tiny fraction of the sediment source and as I drove and today every one of our hundreds of streams on banks furniture is flowing brown as the ones on the on the Kashmir side and round coming off all these low soils yeah of course tons of sediment is pouring into the harvest and long like today I see where all of those streams empty and however by the whole brown but anyway that was one place where we was highly visible that we thought we could make a start in hopefully when this project finally happens it 's taking seems to be taking a long time well thank you very much and would someone like to move that we received the information that we request the second one and request that the third one as well so Andrew seconded by Phil I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much thank you very much _"

    "text": "carried thank you and we 'll move on to my report and and as I 've identified enter fight and there may has been a very busy month for all counselors with the LTP hearings dominating proceedings and obviously working through the myriad of issues that has raised the drinking water supply as I said I 've asked management to focus the next report on the work required to further reduce the chlorine being added to the system so that 's that regular approach to just keeping the foot on the pedal things that we 're and so I really welcome the announcement from the chief executive about the appointment of how in Beaumont and her ability to report to us through the chief executive directly I mean I think it 's a very good reporting regime in it some that 's going to see action taken I think this often preliminary assessment work that 's necessary isn 't seen as action but I can assure you if we can switch off wellheads and that allows the pump not to be chlorinated recognizing that there are certain pressure levels that we 're on our way to get into chlorine free so that you know I can reassure counselors that workers going on very hard behind the scenes I was more than disappointed to be told the cost of reinstating the Town Hall would gone over budget it was very late advice only a month before we were told it was on track and we were put under pressure to sign off on the additional funding because it was we needed to sign contracts for the final piece of work the media we 're going to be briefed on site and June but an attention and I 'll take responsibility for that to the PX release date created a false impression that we were holding this back there was no intention it was always going to be released this month and so I 've asked the chief executive to ensure that release recommendations are now included in all PX papers and she has actions that request and as I 've said on many occasions the total project is still well under what a brand-new facility would have cost we 've saved I think there 's been some misleading commentary which has suggested that this reduces the amount that 's available when the performing arts precinct that nothing could be further from the truth the additional funding for this has not come from the performing arts delivery side of things which still has the same amount of money on budget for the for the completion of the building on the other the other element the other part of the performing arts precinct sorry the rest of my reporters all the good news and I 'm happy to take any questions ok one that I didn 't think was quite such good news was the statement on the public transport that the regional public transport plan that we worked and had a workshop on what concerns me is that this council has already asked that that that committee seek full electrification of the public transport fleet by a certain date so we understand that tomorrow but there needs to be a timeline by which it does happen so will that go to the to the Joint Committee and what foods of possibility is change the model that we currently operate which is very much a race to the bottom in terms of public transport yes so the what watch the Joint Committee members had been governors an early draft and that 's what we 've workshopped so all of the workshop ideas and I can say that Christchurch City will be promoting the the electrification of the bus fleet as part of that they will come back to the Joint Committee on the 20th of June for consideration and then it goes out for public consultation so there will be a very significant period of time available for public consultation and we will do Albert to ensure that that is publicized widely and that people do have the sa it 's run by the Joint Committee on this occasion which has that the that we can cannot delegate the decision but they can delegate the formalities and so there will be hearings panel established at the Joint Committee I doubt it it 'll be a hearings panel I imagine Mike do you remember who 's that do you remember with that no I the hearings panel but they haven 't established the hearings panel yet they 're public hearings public submissions will be called for and there will be a hearing span or stablished and they will hear the submissions I don 't know the answer to that question that I expect that they will be no yeah I thought I volunteered to I volunteered to nominate you to the committee and you refused to be part of it so I 'm not gonna support your nomination to the hearings Pimentel okay thank you Oscar Oprah 's advice to new newly elected members was question everything so with the Town Hall can we put in place some kind of structure or you know either an existing one with one of our standing committees or a new one that looks at applying the blowtorch in a respectful way would start but I get pretty frustrated over you know that the inflation bit but it 's like no I agree entirely and that 's why I 've already discussed with councillors the concept of establishing a capital program committee which is sole focus as the know that the large projects and then the programs of work that settle underneath it so yes or no we 've certainly picked up and that 's why I said in there we need to lift our game on monitoring the capital program and that 's why I 've raised that with councillors I 've raised that with the chief executive she also thinks that 's a very good idea and it 's I think an important way forward and it 's the the issue in relation to to this matter though was that as I understand it the the chief executive is going to sort of provide some feedback on on the how this happened and as you also know part of the resolution of this particular measure was to agree a new process for signing off on the contingency which is now no longer at the project management level that is now lifted right up to the to the general manager level so that it can 't just be signed off yeah I agree and we just need straight communication like the say what you mean mean what it so tight controls as what we want to see from a governance perspective and and a good clear reporting structure that is across the board at the moment we 've got different projects reporting to different committees and I think that having you know you know and I 've sort of said a rottweiler approach at the at the head of it will but as I agree with you it entirely respectful but there is a there is a provision in relation to how yeah there is a provision in terms of how haratz haratz reported so we 've got to tighten up Jonnie thank you in your report might reference to the redzone futures I just wondered if you could just give us a very quick explanation around the decision-making around the redzone futures particularly because we are getting lobbied as individual counselors for certain projects and just wondered if you could just clarify in terms of our role as elected members as a City Council in terms of what happens there versus regenerate in the minister because I think it would be quite beneficial for people to sorry for the red zone futures the attack or even River corridor the attack is open for feedback and obviously we 've been getting a number of emails from individuals concerned over certain projects whether they should be in so can you just give us a kind of clear understanding of the process around the decision-making around the projects that are going to be happening in the redzone going forward and what our role is no that 's that 's not what the exhibition 's about so I honestly thought that regenerate Christchurch had already reported to us on on the process going forward but I 've yeah it 's not my function to to report on the process going forward as part of this report we 've had bridge interact crashes run to ceremony yesterday well as I understand it we 're not making decisions on the futures of its own as a council that 's a metaphor regenerate crusher it you know it 's not it 's a metaphor signing off by the minister that is a process that 's under the Greater Christchurch regeneration act and what will be signed off by the minister not by the council right yeah okay but we will be submitting on it obviously just just carrying on from what is the process then being lobbied by certain groups of their produce that may or may not be in the program at the moment what is their role and that particular function there where we are now starting to hear a lot of noise from certain sectors of the community over the plan that regenerated had come up with do we have any role or import yes clearly these are misunderstanding regenerate Christchurch are not deciding the particular projects that are going to be developed on the site they 're developing a regeneration plan which allows for certain projects to proceed in particular areas should they be resource to do so and but that 's a separate program project program it 's a separate process after the regeneration plan as is resolved so they 're out the air with the exhibition now about the specific areas they 've said that the green spine will be a given in terms of the in there are three areas which they 've asked for further input from the community in relation to their views about what uses those particular pieces of land could be put to so I think that one of the issues that 's come up more than once as the as the temporary use and I have to say that I 'm not entirely first with the process that that sits around temporary use we do need a stronger utilisation of the red zone for temporary purposes for up to five years in different areas some of these project decisions won 't be made for years you know in terms of the the permanent use and some of the areas depending on how long it takes to fundraise for particular options that may or may not be able to proceed so but why don 't we just get regenerate Christchurch and we 'll keep them in front of the council at a meeting such as this perhaps the next one but for the before the submissions close on the exhibition and we 'll get them to repeat what they have said two the community explaining the process it 's all dedicated to on their website but I know that not everyone would have read all of the detail so we 'll get them unto the and to a meeting we 'll get them in front of a live stream and they can explain the process in front of everyone all right does anyone want to move my report on hey just quickly want to make a comment oh I 'm happy to move a second so you can see convene well I just quickly I think um the most important thing is that the community understand how these decisions are going to be made so I mean yeah and what will we have so you influenced that so why are you doing so I mean not the big of my report I 've just said we 'll get regenerate crotchet you 've said you don 't understand the proceeding that will be asked to give our feedback at some stage in terms of regeneration plan what I don 't understand is how the community in terms of their feet that to us so whether we have a specific consultation it 's a reverse we do where we do that so um I just think it 's good be good to get some clarity given that we are getting a number of emails from people I 've just we bring regenerate christchurch here next next meeting yeah but it 's not us I think it 's to the community that needs that clarification understand well circulate as well the link to the original Christchurch website which has got a dedicated section on the process in what I 've described is the braid and you 'll also be conscious that it does under the great across church regeneration neck which was got a clearly specified process and you can share that yani worth you 're the people were asking you so that so that they do understand it and we 'll get rid you know at Christchurch and to reiterate it yeah the irony yes but we don 't need to do that right now and you don 't need to do it off the back of my report you know if I hadn the exhibition you wouldn 't have raised any of these issues so you know I um I 'm just wondering whether my reporting that 's redundant whether I shouldn 't bother is that yeah okay so it 's been moved and it 's been seconded so I put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried _"

    "text": "more even here counselors thank you for hearing this before we start we just want to say how we 're very pleased that you 're supporting our neighbors in reckless next door because the impact of that does have it has an impact on our community as well so any help that you can give Red Cliffs is greatly appreciated by us next-door neighbors the purpose of today 's delegation is just to update you on the funding application that we have when we applied as you have seen the handout you have in front of you hopefully that we had a funding gap of nine hundred and fifty thousand we 've reduced that to 870 due to the successful little sponsor square foot campaign that we 've been running and that 's tracking upwards of about fifty thousand at this moment we 've had a pub charity grant and the kids first candy cotton have honor the cost sharing agreement around geo technical issues because they 're building next door so that brings us down to about eight hundred and seventy thousand and we plan to bridge that gap around 300,000 that 's a conservative mark but we 're confident that we can get that even though we haven 't received yet the revised tender we got loan approval on Tuesday for a loan from the Canterbury Community Trust and so that helps us Bridget as well and we also have other grant applications in and our fundraising will continue so based on that it might sound odd but we 'd like to withdraw our application for a loan from the council because we can 't afford to service two loans and so we 'd obviously prefer to stay with one lender but we would ask that you consider our application to the mirror relief on earthquake fund which we think it 's pups more perhaps more appropriate for the additional hundred thousand that would allow us two things one is would hopefully enable us to achieve our goal of being debt free by the time we open the doors and we 're working towards that but secondly as you probably noticed in Mike 's report that the amount we were going to borrow pretty much cleaned out that that in the pool it allows you to lend that to other community groups seeing as we already have that funding and there may be other groups with your the funding of last resort so it 'd be better to go to them so that 's the purpose of us coming here today is to basically withdraw our loan application and put weight behind our asking for a grant from the Merrill relief fund any further comments Linda so we 're open for questions as anyone got any questions that they want to ask when does it open well the other good news we got besides the Canterbury Community Trust approval this week was that our building consent came is likely to be here by the end of the week this shows with that loan that we can now legally go to contract so prototyping has already started shortly after Christmas bisque is today they say it 's an eight month bill but because it 's a because it 's a new building this building technique hasn 't been used before we can 't give any secure dates but we invited so you 'll get the date of opening on your invitation right okay so I propose that we deal with items five and forty together because an extra effect if we would if we were doing this you know like if suddenly the we accepted your withdrawal of your application under number five and then rejected your can you do it the other way around yeah so I was I was kind of going to say that if we can actually just create a resolution that covers both of them which is that we approve a granted 100,000 to the Mount Pleasant memorial community center so take six point one point one out of paper number 40 and just say that we 've dealt with the two papers together and then and then acknowledged that the that the application for the loan has been withdrawn so it 's just one we 've acknowledged that the application for the loan has been withdrawn and we approved the grant of one hundred thousand dollars which is in the and the other paper so I presume that you 'd like to move discussion on that i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much thank you lady and a great piece of work _"

Kimani have already talked this morning about the successful opening of Torah and in the 14,000 people tour of Queens birthday weekend in the project was put on under budget in on time so fantastic of India and we 've talked back and but also just to bring to council 's attention that the refurbished pioneer Wiccan sports into opened earlier in May and the LTP is both councilors busy but also staff busy and these commentary in the report or met another successful election of Tyrone fields following the by-election to the Banks Peninsula community board and just finally and included a new Reformation as a supplementary report in the meze also circulated some secret information regarding the appointment of Helen Beaumont to lead the improvements to the water program so this is recognition that the experiences have read to date and historically with what was known as the meal task does require dedicated in skilled expertise in the appointment of hell into this role and we think will make a measurable difference too and the quality the outputs that we 're giving and we think this is a recognition of the talents and expertise there he 'll and also brings to the role and she 's grown Owen and two counselors it 's got the technical background in very experienced in water matters so we 're looking for two and who are getting here fade under and the disc issues already started and the role the appointment is reporting directly to the chief executive it 's for 12 months the reason for the 12 month appointment is that it and her role is expected to both manage and the world heads improvement program their temporary temporary chlorination but also to prepare and ensure that we are in the right position to respond to any central government changes which might go well beyond the 12 month period I 'm here but second questions Thank You Leah Thank You Jamie it 's more of a suggestion I wonder if you could take the this least helpful than what it used to be I think it 's you know anything you for the anything for the commentary around that day at last but but just by way of the suggestion I don 't know what other councillors think that I really like the dashboard approach which used to be taken and I 'm finding that it 's sort of gravitating more to a newsletter approach which is fine and there 's some good stuff in there but it 's just me able to track their progress for things so it 's like service delivery capex op opie X key metrics maybe the major projects and how they 're tracking or IT rollout nets or stuff and then just a dashboard approach around year-to-date versus full-year and budget actual and then variance and then forecast actual and variance that sort of stuff is really helpful with our CES report so I just that 's a suggestion from me that that dashboard approach on some of those key metrics are really helpful and the newsletter approach stuff is great but a lot of the stuff 's just my two cents worth on there yeah yeah yeah if possible place yeah okay yeah um yeah okay I 'm just to take two questions one is in regards to the chlorination issue are we able to get an understanding of progress in terms of how many well heads have have been secured and get some more regular reporting on progress and related to that are we able to produce a map showing where people and get either filtered water or non non chlorinated water I mean I don 't quite know how we get progress on the on these issues they have been emailed through raised I 'm happy to take those two issues back to there and TV and passed it on to Helen today there 's a report coming to council next week so and I don 't know that the second issue will be covered off on that but the first issue certainly will be so because there 's a lot of there 's a lot of work that has been going on for months now in relation to assessing each of the well know the chlorine goes in at the pump not at the wellhead and and we want to reduce the amount of chlorine going into the water as quickly as possible with the intention of removing it as soon as we possibly can altogether so so in terms of the report next week if we 've got ideas for things like that have been raised you know maybe council selling at cost water filters or maybe having filling stations our service centers and libraries for non-chlorinated water is that the time to raise those issues yes so raise them Dean because I mean literally Helen Beaumont and I really welcome the focus at the chief executives brought to this issue because what it signals is an overarching approach recognizing that this is not just a council with shuvits Ministry of Health eschew it 's a drinking water Assessor issue it 's a medical officer of health issue and it 's obviously of primary concern it 's a community issue they want to get back to chlorine free as soon as possible and so do we Tim thank you no I see although I 'd love to take credit I can 't they 're a regular update here in Helens and place because the UFC right this is a city issue a resonance issue ratepayers issue and probably the single most important issue yep second even over above the OTP to have the live updates so we are live streamed and have the odd update to counselors is I think great but for the residents of waste of time so I think ahead for Helen or somebody doing it a regular update here and live would be really helpful to end up Carolyn agreed with this there 's also a blog that 's now developed the through news line which has been regularly updated as well so the blog will now contain Helens new role and and she 'll be in front of the council next week yeah so it 's been enormous ly challenging for here to take the role up last Friday and she 's in front of council next Thursday yes yes that 's a very good idea thank you I 'm who had their hand up Daniel just doing a review of the engagement strategy at a number of of us around the table always get sort of you know complaints about the resource consenting process and stuff like that can we feed into that review of course thank you it 'd be good good any other questions would someone like to move that thought we received two second up by Mike I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried _"

    "text": "so back to horse all form be returned community board across McDowell Gary Watson this morning Ross morning man cancellous thanks for the opportunity pretty short from us fortunately just our delegated decisions for a couple of small one making decisions nothing critical we 're probably just an hour delegation we yeah just granted a lease to conservation new zeal the conservation volunteers New Zealand London and these people are going to reside at the former managers house Rory was built in 1927 switch out of the facility via so can accommodate up to eight people in there and the manager will have a day office and the bottom area down there this group have very impressive set of Statistics just gloss over him in the last 12 months they planted one hundred and fifty eight thousand trees propagated 128,000 weeded so 250 hectares removed three thousand eight hundred kilograms of rubbish put in a hundred thousand volunteers and supported national over three hundred community groups this was a absolute one for us to get these people here they have facilities including Wellington punic like Ian Dunedin and what will they will be tasked in association with their Park Rangers team a work within the quarry itself in the wider area and also able to be offered to third-party organizations and I think you 'll recall the long-term plan here that 's submission from the Bradley trust which some care mentioned early if there 's time available they can venture over there for days at a time and work away the I think you 'll recall they lost their Corrections Department labor so there is an ability to fill that little hole there so yeah five-year lease complete alcohol drug free policy up there that won 't be party paradise believe me I live in Hana but yeah just a really good synergy I suppose with with their group moving on leadership groups the engagement team had the leadership day on the third of May over thirty nine people or a local leaders took place and I can 't get a lot of them were we use and very again just a really worthwhile get together and it was able to to engage those people and where they go from also have coming up 27th of June around community service and news service awards we 've got ten community service awards to Hugh 's service awards and a number of certificates of appreciation for people mix one Gary is this one was Adam partnered in tandem with the arc development trust and Rick Adam this is was absolutely brilliant to have old ray and older fella 85 year old come to our board and speaker he had never cooked in his life between him and his wife they decided that either one on them all the other was going to go first which could leave him to have to repeat prepare the meals so this group engaged a professional chef and they 're going to do this on an ongoing basis so the next two years just to help those people older younger migrants etc just to be more prepared and more resilient in their own community should they have to and they had been prepared for themselves the other component of that as with the migrant groups our wood based board members have been working to promote an emergency worst happen in their communities with various things up and operating our four critical networks and our audio era they also the Asian group Hornby community workers luncheon they 're recommending network liaison group and the invent youth workers forum these were all groups that were originally initiated by our community and engagement teams and now that virtually all been taken over under the wing of the community facility at facilitated operations yeah big one coming up or just completing really an area is that the record and road upgrade it 's been a huge effort this one over a long time things will sit and settle down until the next stage which is from Harry Kiki Street through to them to Mehta post streets major saw upgrade major upheaval busiest bus route in Canterbury and it was past the Westfield more tender processes M&O and the contractor hopefully to be appointed in October important Cogan who have just repeat completed the road repairs for the first stage come along to a board and nerve initiated a new process whereby they 're putting down these two I see where she it 's about this so it 's really a long-term effects done well done properly given the obvious upheaval to the whole community based on the works in the area that 's a really good long to process a wee bit ball but you know you get what you get recently this was a bit of a sad story with a good ending um the app of Memorial Library was forcibly closed by staff engineers because of an unsafe building one of those difficult scenarios with the community own the building but this council owned the land underneath er and as landowners we are reliable as an entity should something occur had a walkway as you can see just beside the container the public walkway it had to be closed which meant obviously everything had to come out of that building in this case 14 council staff took it on themselves along with some community board members and their families to clear that library up just a really worthwhile day it was the engineers that had to shut it down it was the engineers that turned up in their own the feedback we got from there from that elder group at the library it 's just wonderful to know that so many angels are still out there in christchurch after we 've all been through what we have in our city so nice feedback a bit like um kashmir sprayed and with a couple of holes in the area which don 't do we fix do we not you know there 's a you see if it is a sustainable use and once you but year this one of a bit of a tongue twister Mike told me they 've got to get out the hyper helpful random facts and just a little bit of information on a former temple Don Hospital site was close close to 20 years ago now it 's a unique area which still has a institutional base but not quite the ring fence that used to happen to the community for templeton Nova trusts which is residential drug and alcohol program Innovation Park with those some agribusiness and research to the in tenants and their breckenridge which is supporting people was elected short disabilities whis and is the temple driven capital and they 're all also tagged in there as well as the whiter haskell whiter has schools recently relocated to a school called temperature sorry lemon would Grange in Ralston however they are setting up a sub site in the new night stream school and halls walls and it 's a very much integrating some of these some disability based and lecture based um facilities within the community so a 1-1 there other than that that 's all from out west all things are relatively stable in concern no no I think we haven 't got time for questions though we 've reached our ten minutes so thank you very much okay very good very good time exhibition Jimmy team would like to move in Galloway with my second and I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried but thank you very much and this the conclusion of the community board reports _"

it from the rooftops since we were told so please please well talk about the status in case tell people so it 's yeah I don 't know it 's out there I was just going to you know carry on and and tell us about it it 's a fantastic piece of news you know just over such good piece of news to share yeah and I just want to make sure your onion yeah this is only the third place isn 't it yeah and when I was fear was but and the other ones the first teams so um you know I think it 's really big news yeah and an area so it 's great I 'll go back to our board report and we had no part as and we 've approved lots of road markings and tracking restrictions as you can see oh yeah you don 't Nixon and we 've done lots of funding for a variety of projects through different parts of our funding but also our discretionary fund and we a significant council projects that the for a new lender walleston port facility and and as you can see it is the in this that 's really really exciting now we can enter the concept designs which has to come which will come back to the board and will go out to the community as well so it 's really good and we had a visit to see her the bridge is going on and his cat lover at the Washington cat and that was you know quite amazing out the any of you who have who have small boys or grandchildren or something and want to see get them to see some machinery going and just is a great place to take them um yeah next one our public forums been really well attended and you can see some of the things they 're a bit people have talked to us about I think I think the biggest one near is that and people came in and talked about the temperate alcohol being and Lynwood village and her what a what a great difference it 's making and then one fellow tweet we 're really you know people are saying to us it is making a difference yep you mean to make more measures of interest we had a proposal from some some people to say they 'd really like to see walsim Park revitalized as a community hub where people can enjoy outdoor activities and events and we 'd really like to see that go ahead was um yeah I think we 're doing a subject and first aren 't working with yeah we 've organized first from our discretionary funded to a sub team report and the area to try and make sure we have it safe first and then we 'll work from there yes this one we have a group that works with us and we have representatives from our board on this and we 're paying for a camera on the corner of Aberdeen and Manchester Street from our discretionary fund for a security for us for this group and it 's going to hit already that 's been approved next one next one I 'd like to talk about a wee bit more and you 've got quite a be able to read but basically in 2017 you do November meeting we asked staff to urgently meet with the police to discuss the installation monitoring of closed-circuit cameras closed-circuit cameras and the affected areas and the vicinity of Linwood village and authorizing installations should it be agreed and we asked the staff so it December meeting of council a result urgently meet with police to discuss the installation and monitoring of closed-circuit cameras so we 've been waiting since December to see about this because we are prepared if we 're prepared to take this money out of our discussion front but we know that after the earthquakes the council provide the police with a budget to install security cameras around the city and maintain them once installed and this budgets now been cut so there 's only a budget for maintaining the existing cameras and the account LTP has no provision for any new security cameras but like I say we 're prepared to pay for these but we just need action on this point you see because we we know that they 're needed there we know to see this move for here as fast as possible so I 'm just wondering if we can have some feedback from staff about how quickly we can get it done I 'll leave it one with you the installation of flagpoles and Sumner and the very tuned Services Association has wants some flag poles there we 've got a recommendation that we provide information on the installation of flag poles and we will be prepared to pay for this but I think that it 's not necessarily I think the the return services Association may pay for those but we did have we did have a flagpole on the old some that comedian seen the building prior to the earthquakes so they like they want one for the insect day services water fountains we ready to see we had 20,000 from the last year 's annual plan process allocated to fountains in the central city and staff identifying suitable sites for this but we 've also asked them to look alert across our board area for other possible sites as well the other thing I 'd like to bring you and that 's effect of the H if Z in a zone where the flooding zone prevent all the coastal areas where we 're getting people who are buying sections and the reckless type area where and paying huge amount of money for ain 't been told they can 't get a resource consent to build on there so we organized we 're currently organizing together seminar was hopefully with planning staff to have some sort of resolution for this because it 's going to meet end up as an issue which will get a lot of earring and I think in the newspaper we don 't get something organized with it I think that 's all today thank you very much I think that final words been raised with the council and from an organizational point of view we do need to have a better understanding of how the district plan rules which which have been implemented through the independent hearings panel protease estoppel I assume enough for us I think yeah try and understand those but it 's a coastal food joint that is a joint thing you to those cameras for them advantage would be a big priority first thank you thank you thank you for your long term plan but it and your annual report I hope we have got time for a number questions um so moved by Dion receipt of the report Sikandar by Yanni I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "finger ups in my mind here would community board Sam McDonald and met McClintock Aaron as well oh and Aaron is way I am good morning I was gonna be birthday in Japanese there 's no say in Japan happy birthday a chance to present our board report it 's relatively light this month and that we 've had one meeting the second meeting didn 't reach corn because of the LTP submissions and we felt that it was more important that councilors with you then to come in to that but we 've played catch-up on monday made quite a extensive meeting just a couple of things to touch on firstly there were no parties but we 've got one of you coming next month so I heads-up on that and then as we go through got a bit of a PowerPoint they 're just we thought we 'd highlight just a couple of key things happening in their ear at the moment just to update you around the jelly Park recreational center and so that 's still ongoing and there 's a sparkle in this one which have the outdoor area we hope that 's done by the end of November the G freeze road replacement water tank and again that 's something that will come to you eventually it 's just are you signal that that 's been out for consultation that 's coming to the board hopefully late July at late June but it may be early July so just a heads-up on that Arbor Day tree planner you 'll see David and Erin doing the heavy lifting on the health and safety officer for the day Stanley back we had that on Monday which was quite effective and a nice way to start our board meeting and before I hand over to Erin I just want to touch on this one community issue which and has been in the media recently were in our local papers around parking issues particularly in my ward and the why Mary Ward around the Rusli Business Park it 's more just a signal that there has been a call for from some locals for reason and parking but we 're off see we 're at at the moment we the highlight to you Erin did you want to touch on there yes so a group of the month is the Bishop Bell means like to acknowledge selling back behind me here and helping start the group with the community the previous Community Board not only do they do what they do which I 'm sure you all know but they also helped out the board or the joint boards of Pendleton named and people returned with culture galore and doing that kind of traffic management on the day so volunteering the time and the support to help not only you know what they 're doing there but also the wider community so thank you very much for that and the only other thing just to notice the community service awards so I would head eleven eleven nominations and from them and we 're working through them at the moment so they 'll be presented to us at the upcoming board meeting and then there 'll be an award ceremony on the 3rd of July so that 's everything from us like I say next month we 've got a with us because I mean the social enterprise side of it it 's just it 's actually quite a wonderful wonderful thing and I had no idea that was going on so it 's really great that you bring these things you know please do because I just think that maybe use this as an opportunity weird live-streamed to to tell a little bit about the story because it 's fantastic it 's an organization that 's some spread throughout New Zealand so if these people watch behind that viewing from other parts of New Zealand there 's there 's a min kid near you is a mention you you I think this one Amber Lee I 'm driving past so yeah it 's just a fantastic spot to keep total hands a little bit more active also engages the mind the the men that go along to this [Music] there 's a shyness that they need to kind of overcome because yeah and that always came just on that and for a visit something your honors in the community there 's a couple of days each week without their from Eva so keep that in mind yeah thank you there 's a reserve nature of New Zealand mean that Michelle and kind of interact there it takes a big step for some to overcome so the introduction for Meena can be quite slow but once they get over then they can get within the the organization it 's really good and they are absolutely expanding into kind of engaging with women and things like that yeah Pauline and in yeah you think this is incredible program I know that they 've actually lean I think they means she had built quite a few planter pots through our social housing units too so it 's a great community donations that they made but my question is do you just see them in this form with really just highlighting this T Council as a hub I really like this idea of group of the manifold the community boards shout out so Marianne for so look we need to do ask we have so many groups with them and every board does have so many groups do such good work that 's thing about this is I came to partner with us as well so there 's a lot of businesses where it actually saves the council money and gives these guys a purpose so it 's a win-win really quite block building our plant reports for the social housing one of the board reports last year that I presented they were making kids seeds for penguin houses basically the school code school children could then construct and presented to conservation groups along the coastline firms of England thank you and Sam you actually touched on what I was going to ask about you but you 've had the means you 're partners with Council on projects what are some of the projects that they do work alongside council weapon how can we strengthen that because it 's such a great way for water yes so obviously the one that fell and we were talking about in terms of social houses and the planter boxes was one of them happening as Erin mentioned as well the culture galore so I mean Francis it 's kind of just identifying projects in the area actually and just connecting the people together to go away and do it so we don 't necessarily need to get in the middle of it but if we can put the right people in contact they go on and it 's real benefit at a really low cost to the community they 're very keen to activate the space the the former bishop dowel library site which is now just a grass area its gonna erupt off it would be great for all of their community boards the prince you know we focus on that a little bit and on those groups cuz I think we all have one it would be good to sort streets in that relationship isn 't it yeah thank you look think thank you very much and I 'm assuming that Jamie would like to move the report and Erin would like to second it I will put that motion all those in favor say aye there 's a person no that 's scary thank you _"

    "text": "thank you very much papa Louie Ernest community boards Eddie Jones Christine main thank you [Music] [Music] right well as you 'll see from our I 've happy birthday she already had too many happy birthdays anyway and so you 'll see from our PowerPoint that today the presentation has brought to you by mud there 's quite a bit going on in the ward and of course with the weather that we 've had there 's quite a lot of mud in our photographs the really good news obviously for our ward is that apart from some surface flooding with all the rain that we 've had there haven 't been problems and I think that that 's all credit to the work that has gone in and the effort that 's gone on over the last two or three years so this is a SAN orbán 's parking pavilion there 's the mud a lot of rain that 's a lovely looking cricket pitch in the middle that is all on track and in fact I 've had some really positive feedback from residents who have just got a pace which is wonderful to see and I think all credit again to staff for keeping residents and the loop as to what 's happening and that 's been helpful as well know part a recommendations actually just don 't go back to that two main issues in the water at the moment and we 'll just let the pictures go through well actually that 's our first main issue in the ward actually the Northern Corridor is powering along I 'll let the pictures just roll through they 're on a timer and we are we 've just completed consultation which has called the downstream effects of the CNC the Northern Corridor project and we delivered all stuff delivered 12,000 documents to residents 400 submissions were received a hundred and eighty of those were received after the first two of four sessions four or five sessions consultation sessions the board will have a workshop giving us feedback on what not detailed not drilling down but an overview of the consultation on the 20th of June and I am Jim will be able to make some public comment after really important to note here especially in this public forum is that there has been some reportage around and we 'll always get this I guess with them consultations is that this is a foregone conclusion it 's a fait accompli counsels made its mind up etcetera etcetera and I said in the last presentation from the board to the council that the consultation documents are fantastic as far as the information they contain and how clear they are so it 's really disappointing to hear that actually from residents and attending one of the consultations I had someone say exactly the same thing to me and I think by the end of the conversation speaking to staff their opinion had changed what staff have said to me and council officers at the consultation is that they have received some really valid interesting and significant suggestions and information from residents and that 's the whole point of consultation so those will be I am sure a number of those will be incorporated and we 'll hear about that on the xx it 's also important to note that the project with the cnc team involved in Christchurch City Council staff but it is an NZTA project so that has been put in place and we are now dealing with the downstream effects from the Innes Road intersection we are doing what our community has asked us to do and look at how we can mitigate those or the increased traffic and congestion so we 're actually just doing what our community is asking us to do so again it is I have to say a little disappointing when we are perhaps accused of not doing what we should have and perhaps not doing what we should have done any sooner this is the soonest that we could do it so we look forward to that presentation on the 20th the second biggest issue in the water at the moment is still around the richmond shirley area and i think again staff engagement was residents there has been excellent there have been two or three hookups and i 'm not going to go into details with it there was some fliers that weren 't delivered and that 's been dealt with 've got a community that is still so ruled that these things happen but again staff have been fantastic at pulling that back and dealing with it we have a staff meeting or rather a community meeting that is scheduled for what 's my my ear Christine Tuesday they all know that we 've had that 13th or 15th of June so it 's in mid June and this will be to address the concerns of residents and they will be staff there as well and we 're doing a roading audit around the area because that 's clearly a concern with the standard and quality of the roads so there will be eroding orders and that information will be presented at that as well and that 's been received positively by members of the community so those are the two main ones some positive stuff happening in the ward as well I mean obviously the San Albans Park that 's very positive the Papa Nui Busch and the Bridgestone reserve regeneration project we had our second planting day on Tuesday John stringer and Emma nourish braved the cold weather plants planted initially in the first stage and April in the second stage how many 1500 1500 plants were planted yesterday Papa noe high school turned out in good numbers which was excellent and so that 's a very very positive project to regenerate the native forests and the Bridgestone Reserve just being with me while I flick through my notes we 're increasingly are Boyd and impressed by community organizations engaging with areas of the community one such project at the moment is the Papa Nui Community Survey it 's being driven by the Papa Nebo Baptist freedom and Northgate trusts it started in March at the Papa Nui neighborhood day and it 'll go through octo to October this year there are 70 individual surveys that have been completed to date and what this involves is social media Facebook and neighborly are also reaching residents but there 's door-knocking going on and it 's going around the neighborhood and saying are you okay are there any issues that 's that face-to-face contact and invariably it throws up issues that we would never have known about in these community really positive thing that our community groups are doing I think that is about all I don 't take up any more of your time I will just flick through no that 'll do let 's look at the time at the front end I 'm just quickly Phil injure me thank you early and the PowerPoint you head around the northern arterial just seemed to be a section the where there might be potential into the public transport to actually have some land set aside for a form of park-and-ride have your board it 's really interesting Phil we hadn 't thought of that actually I think it 's some yeah and the guess and that 's right Paul ends to see that coming through in the submissions and and that 's where it will come through we can we can address it but yeah that 's a very good point because the cycleway obviously in getting people using it just in case you didn 't know because it 's going to be a very busy road what we 're trying to do to as brings cycle cyclists through down Rutland Street so instead of taking them off they 're really busy road there will be speedy cyclists much like Mike Davidson I 'm sure that we 'll use the speedy cram for the street one but there is an option to take kids for example in schools in the area but you know that 's good idea Thank You Jimmy 20 you mention a papa Louie community so wait well I think because they 're volunteer groups mainly Jimmy and you know it 's people who are working as well as doing the survey there will be tenants who and and people who own house the houses that aren 't there so they 'll go back and review seasonally I think it 's a good idea to get an idea of what the issues are across a year through the summer and the spring and the winter which can throw up other issues as well so yeah it 's a long time but it gives us really good and flora gives the organization 's really good information thank you thank you very much might would you like to that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much _"

    "text": "Karin Tata sprayed on Kashmir community board before board report this time I 'd like to draw your attention to the on the front page where we 're looking at the youth awards there are three young people there who have got traveling internationally one two of them are going to future problem-solving world championships but the last bloke the young man is going to Globe Theatre Workshop and performances in London and I just can 't really believe the experiences that young people can have these days and I 'll see the appearance must shudder when they think it 's a next project those kids are going to involve themselves in but that to max the joys of being on the community border so you get to see those that give those awards and see it sometimes see them come back and report on them um with I 'm just want to mention briefly the couple of projects in our ward coronation Hall along with Centennial Hall we had a report on Centennial Hall in our last meeting these are sort of two two structures that have been sitting motorbike went into it the other that remain unused and unloved and I 'm here for and we look forward to the LTP coming out to find out if we can actually further the issues that both of them carry in the center of our ward it 's depressing seeing both of these structures that were heavily used in their day deteriorating in the middle of the ward and we would like to we had hopes that the LTP will give us something that could either assist in making fun a bit kinder system final decisions about both and the off the ground fund is a fund that was established actually was Ginny Huey 's idea staff member Ginny Huey and it was her idea several years ago immediately after the earthquake that we would have a small fund that would give joy and the intent of the funders to do nothing else it is only to one off two organizations for whatever they dream up that might add up to 250 and its only intention really is to give joy and it is one of those it has become have gone small and it 's really nice to have something that we can say to the community we can help with that when they 've got a bus truck for older people or planning to build a dragon in the kindergartens playground and then and it does give us joy to to be able to approve some of the applications that we most the applications that we get and the processes of there 's no process really it 's just they ask for something tell us why and we say this community workshop on the district plan and resource management that processes this took a long time to organize and I wish we did more of them some of the processes of counsel and legislation arcane and difficult to understand and being able to talk to the community about how the district plan is organized what it does where it happens who 's in charge and the resource management debt processes and the changes that have occurred there and is really interesting and I think I 'd like to I 'd like us to do more of them the years we had the mother of all cleanups and one of the founders of the river network is on our board helene mount nur and our board involves ourselves all of the members of our board involve ourselves in this this is a cleanup of the river from the hip from the top of the earth get through to the history and all of the organizations along his gut power ho his good are involved and people to come along in huge numbers actually to clean up I think it was eight hundred just over and that I collected and we have the cooperation of the council staff which is great and we met I met lots of residents on the day who were helping to clean up with their children and this was this was yesterday see that K Faye Collins on our staff Wow she made that tape for us and we had we had won the opening of the st. Martin 's library Fayette Collins made a cake which was a pile of books that the icing was a pile of books and faith and they fits and so they made that and she doesn 't out of the great goodness of her heart and and we had this is a morning tea for the crepe crop gardeners and if you look up there all of those people they 're heavily involved elsewhere in the community some of them were in the junior children 's library some of them are involved John cousins is there and Rick they are involved in the craft residents association Carolyn Caro second to third to lift is a Cray Croft Wilson was born a cracker of Wilson and the non suburb and I 've got a discussion about that of Cray craft which is one of the binds is that they 're not officially a so the Cray Croft is named after her family as as the old stone house and she set the example of going on the zipline at a very at a glorious age and so all of those people there were gardeners in the craic rock gardens and they loved it and they loved the gardens and they acted under the control the stern control of Norma Roberts under the stew of beauty and norman roberts who were the ones who saved the old stone house and they 've great they 've had to give up the garden it has got too much for them and they we came in and had a morning tea with them yesterday which was terrific I had ordered lemming Tain 's and cream on everything and the silent language week these are for quite frightened people singing in the foyer of the City Council here and they came from rally school until Morton school to sing for some on language week they did that last news day didn 't they was last Tuesday and the progress report with the pamphlet Melanie will be is absolutely thrilled that her idea of a pamphlet coming out in the rates has finally come to fruition and the age-friendly is age-friendly action plan is being launched at the older adults Network meeting next in 4th of July and there on the back is a note about the crater off suburb residents seeking some kind of understanding of what it means to be a suburb and are a suburb or not and this is arisen because the name hoon has been splashed around 10 or 11 K 's apart one goes up the belly one goes up the valley near a horse will quarry panicked but hoon hay itself is over that over much closer to the side of town and sprayed and near sprayed and sorry and that was an issue that we 'd like to raise with staff which is there and I think it probably is an issue every week thank you I used to cheering you just keep I was I was just um I was just looking up how you make a locality and create you know so the suburb names hey make them official and yeah I thought yep yep it 's all been done the only organization that doesn 't recognize that is the council yes but how do you mean well that 's gone it 's been registered or whatever through the government so that the the Crown has recognized pro Croft is akin aber hood is a suburb of the suburb so they don 't use Eiland that 's the council that doesn 't and there are the really see them post recognize it so yeah that 's the anomaly well yeah it 's not respondent advising that the area 's returned in a rates and valuation search and not what would be considered suburbs they are administrative boundaries and do not align to other agencies definition of suburbs so so well you 're all you 're asking is that our rates and valuation search identifies er is a suburb not as just as an area that they can rate would take we 'll take it up dominate some brought to our attention officially thank you right so this term would you like to move the receipt of the report and seconded by Phil I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that is carried there _"

that 's really good as I say that the year we were born as a great year but I won 't divulge when we were born and so what we have for you today is no pates so that 's quite straightforward then we go straight to some of the things that have been actually sitting on the table of the community for quite some time so this month we 've had a few things come to fruition which is very exciting and the first one that we have for you today is the fitness trail which I mentioned last month so it was officially opened at the beginning of May we had about 60 people from Dellen teen community come and join us to celebrate and the Darlington community cottage trust and the community board members and also council staff and other residents associations it was a fantastic day it was really cold as you can see up there cut the ribbon there they were gentlemen that time the project began once they hit the vision and they passed it on to the Darlington Community Center that it 's Anton qur 'anic and Bill Ehlert so it was really exciting to get them to be able to come and take part in that celebration there so in the staff does an amazing job putting it all together in the Darlington community oh you can skip that one but Darlington Community College trusts were the ones that have raised the money for the project and the council are going to be actually looking at the maintenance but I must have met well there was a confession that you 've got Glen there that you went the week before and got him to your lycra and had the media sort of opportunity but on the day he came along and there 's good gear so you know we did have a bit alike with there but not actually the morning but a really great facility that community is now able to enjoy so what a week this was a fantastic opening your report as well but the opening of the toe acuity recreational sport long time coming for this community it 's fantastic it was an amazing afternoon the Sun came out which was really nice we had people from the community of course and the children and invited guests which were all wanting to celebrate the replacement of the old earth quake damage to qe2 it was a fantastic day and I know it 's dangerous to be thanking people but apart from thanking the council for getting on with that but there 's huge things go to mark Nigel John and their team from staff that really put that together hmm it was just an amazing outstanding we 've always kept in the loop all the way through also the apollo team steve hasty and his team it was just absolutely outstanding so very very exciting day that was and it was very appropriate to open the qe2 facility on the Queen 's birthday weekend so whether that was planned intentionally not short but it was just a fantastic I don 't think you 'll get 14,000 people with Ellis full capacity yeah you know over the weekend so so exciting to see so there was a lot of happy faces and a lot of weak ones I must say and did we have a picture of David the image is going to remain indelibly implanted I 'm sorry the other person that I saw it as takis which was really great so it was Aaron not was great to see my counselors but some of us accidentally on purpose forgot our talk so yeah you know it was an amazing day so thanks very much yeah that was great so well dancing everybody that was very exciting now we 're going to go to the memorandum of understanding but uh ternary Community Trust attached on this last time what we 've actually had up now that was a really special evening that we had there with Rob and the team and Rachel you can see us there we all signed our thing it was beautifully decorated the room with a mess of big chocolate cake but it was a signing of that Memorandum of Understanding which acknowledged and group and the positive and special working relationship that we have with them so that was a real honor to be there and to celebrate that so good on actors for all the work that they do in the community and now we have a special agreement and understanding between us so that was a really nice evening as well to some of our other significant issues we had last time I was here we talked about some resource consenting issues that we haven 't Southshore not just in South Shore but regarding the high flood hazard management area and the board organized the meeting the residents had come to us and had raised their concerns and they weren 't getting too far so the community board organized a meeting with the resource consent staff and that was a really positive formation we had it a few weeks ago and the staff and the residents found it very beneficial and they appreciated it very much the time that was taken to discuss and understand I hope you were not a bit read song but now a lot of super baldie a really good feedback since then and some positive actions from that meeting have been done and also the north-central Heathcott community hosting this affects them as well and the area so they 're actually now going to be hosting a workshop to get some doing some understanding on how that affects their residents the other issue that we do like sounding like a crack record the history edge issues there and South Brighton and that area around the camping ground we had we 've had to workshop now which has been really good with staff region and II can to discuss the lack of the earthquake repairs along that foreshore and the protection works against erosion which are needed the proposed works in this area just we 've just put them slightly on hold until we have another meeting tomorrow to debrief about the meetings that we 've just had so really putting a lot of time and effort into this this is an issue for the community as we 've mentioned and the long term plan but just to flag that the eastery hoot I trust have also LTP submissions that this stretch of the eastery each needs erosion protection now so and that we have had an estimate cost of about 500,000 but in the last couple of days sadly with the weather that we 've just had another trees which she fallen over and more damage to the edge occurred so you know urgency is really needed for this at the moment so the next thing we 've got will Meacham that talking about the red zone Vicky brought up last time about the the area there so we have actually as a board ass learns to come along and just there was an update on the transitional use that hasn 't ended there along that Ivanhoe DeCaro corridor another exciting thing that opens also that Leanne 's mentioned in her report was the red zone futures Aven Oh Takeru River corridor options which has they have the officers and central city idea and wanting the feedback from our residents so there 's been really good interest in this exhibition and the board will be visiting at the center in the coming weeks it 's going all the information because there 's some amazing pictures and information to go with it so you know that 's exciting and finally also the pier has been repaired and it 's open and complete so you can now go fishing on the end of it and enjoy the pier again so yeah thank you so is one minute remaining of your ten minutes thank you very much for your report that 's good then I 'm presume David you 'd like to move the receipt of the report and second of bugling livingston including the photo the photo

    "text": "just in terms of having acknowledged Christine 's passing could I invite the Banks Peninsula community board Pam Richardson and Joan Richfield forward to come forward first thank you good morning christine and can I just say what her loving service was held at the recreation ground mechanics around the world the humanity for us and Kristine 's friends her family and learned about some of the antics of the best ship boys and the other rugby players it was an amazing occasion but it just went so smoothly and we had a fine day so yes Christine we remember you so the next one as we move on to stone cottage at autumn Brady Park now you 'll also be going to author Bradley Park to have a look at autumn Bradley it is an old farm it 's got a lot of history around it it was a reverend Bradley who originally owned it and he was a minister and decided that the farming life was a better life to have so he changed his focus and this is one of the earliest cost stone cottages and LeAnn 's one of Canterbury 's oldest buildings and it was badly damaged in the 2011 earthquakes but the amazing thing about it is the repair of it and the the number of people around it that did that free had a passion about it and did it freely and donated their time and expertise so we are very thankful that that was some that 's been done and a great celebration so do go and have a look at autumn Bradley particularly in the spring for HAP 's when the when the bulbs are out the rhododendrons there it 's amazing Park is amazing walkways and still part of it as as a farm and there 's a lot of old farming exhibitions there as well if we move on to Omar now this is a challenging process that we 've got underway at the moment or over 600 submissions to this reserve it 's one of 15 reserves that we have on banks peninsula and the reserves under the reserves that are required to have management plans and this is just the development plan that we 've got on a few challenges working through it 's right behind the town it 's a mix of walking tracks and cycle tracks and there 's also a passion of planting team around it it 's a great spot close behind the town if there seems to be some end indiscriminate track work going on there so we 're just trying to resolve those issues and get down to a safe plan that where people and the cyclists and the walkers can all cordon all live and work together and get on with the job the management committee needs a little bit of guidance and we 're going through quite a lengthy process to come out with the court decision out the other end but it 's just going slowly but I think we will have the result right results shortly so at the end of we could move to the recreation ground now this is where the were there was two huge marquees for Christine 's funeral on the recreation ground and the amazing thing was that they fit it on there beautifully the other thing was that those rugby leads rugby and so this is a very important part of Littleton 's recreation opportunities very important part of the community 's opportunities and as part of that navel point development area where we 're looking at a number of things that we hope will happen over the next few years in that area will be improved and at some it isn 't a mix of industrial activities and things around that area and it 's got some risks in the area but that being addressed and hopefully that we will come out also with that with a great recreation ground rugby field and it 's a field for many things down there and we were looking at the parking and that around that so the next one is a corral wastewater well this is another ongoing cycle we seem to have a number of little sagas that are challenging us in the a Corral community we have spoken about it before and the deep well injection that 's being being explored the idea of that now from that we have also got a devotionals wastewater program that some its consent to have a consent in place but I think about 2023 so the work that 's happening on the echo our wastewater does also have an impact on the devotionals scheme as well that 's being suggested so if the waste but if the deep well injection and echo are as appropriate then it will be used and perhaps used in the devotional situation will be very helpful along the way won 't need some actually and it 'll be on council land where um where that takes place too so yes we have got a number of challenges and what 's our last one that 's it so yes but I did actually just want to pull out of there out of our report the number of the number of there where we an hour deep number of deputations that were getting to our boards along to our board meetings are very well attended people are very interested in what 's going on and we provide them with every opportunity so I just want to thank our staff for all their at their time that they give to us to us three help for them we 've got some great talents within our team so thank you I don 't have any questions of Pam thank you that 's an excellent report Andrew would you like to move but we received and seconded by Sarah I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much pain I didn 't see the ten minutes ticking over no but I didn 't put the timer on but you will you were within the ten minutes thank you _"

    "text": "you good morning we 'll declare the meeting open so I 'll call the meeting to order please so welcome to our council meeting for the 24th of May and I 'd like to provide a particular welcome this morning to the very full public gallery that we 've got we have a number of students from New Zealand broadcasting school here this morning welcome great to have you at our meeting I 'll call for apologies and I 'll have an apology for lateness from Jana Johansson and from the mayor and from Raph man G so they 're all apologies for lateness I 've got apologies for early departure from Jaime golfNow from David East and from Jimmy Chen and depending on the timing of meeting Dave East 's maybe a partial absence rather than early departure and Mike early departure from like Davidson any advance on that one Alan I 'd like to think we can accommodate them and early departures from the mayor and council of mangie right okay okay so I 'm happy to move those apologies do I have a second Sarah Templeton all move to declarations of interest and obviously there are some conflicts of interest around the appointment of directors that comes in the public excluded part of the agenda not aware of anything else that 's been indicated so now let 's move to item three public participation we have two public forum items this morning and I 'd like to invite Natalie Wales to the table who 's going to speak to us about Christchurch Hospital car parking so Natalie thank you very much indeed for joining us the public forum part of the meeting provides five minutes for you to address councillors thank you as Nestle Wales and I 'm a concerned citizen and I 've taken time off work today because I 'm so concerned about the current patent situation at that constant hospital in particular the safety of our nurses and health workers particularly those on night shift or early morning shifts also the public accessing ane especially at nighttime family members and friends visiting various set loved ones and the eyes through you those people with outpatient appointments who have injuries or severe illnesses I 've how difficult planning a car park can be last year I was keeping my friend company at hospital as her husband underwent life-threatening major surgery and I had to leave her several times to go and shut to my car so wouldn 't be clamped or towed there were no close car parts available at that time either I found the whole situation very stressful and the parking just added to that situation I know that although the park-and-ride shuttle from things F can be very helpful to some people to most people it 's quite far away from the hospital and standing around in winter and the cold winters not great along with the puddles and potholes in the car park itself which are all issues which I 'm sure you 're all aware of that need addressing I think we definitely need a car park building close to the hospital especially to replace the one that was lost in the earthquakes and we also I think should have some designated car parks especially for the A&E department I personally would like to see a working group put in myself if that 's possible health sector workers the Christchurch City Council the DHB and also house patient advocate I realized that this is a complex issue that it affects a number of different organizations and that of course funding is always an issue the well things have been worked out our people and staff at the hospital I feel are being put at risk for me I 'm speaking on behalf of all those vulnerable and powerless people who know there is an issue but just don 't have the time or energy to do anything about it and for myself I would like to be part of the solution not just sit and moan about it in conclusion I believe we need to look at this situation promptly and efficiently realizing that a short-term solution and a long-term solution will be mended and that all parties involved need to work together to bring about a suitable and working solution thank you for your time and you will have had electronically hopefully on your emails a list of this conversations this is from the neighborly websites been are long as I understand has been uploaded to the hub so thank you very much indeed for providing that have you also provided a copy of your presentation to us electronically as well yes I have that 's great thank you very much indeed all right thanks for taking the time to come and present to us this morning it 's some certainly valued thank you thank you and secondly I 'd like to call to the table Michel de Latour who also is going to speak to us about hospital car parking solutions as Michael here Michael is not here okay thank you very much so then moving on deputations by appointment there are non presentation of petitions there are none item 29 supplementary reports so we 've got a resolution here to include the supplementary reports item 30 and item 31 I 'm happy to move that resolution Pauline casas well second all those in favor again that 's carried now moving to the council in committee minutes so this is items 5 6 7 which are council minutes 9 which is the innovation and sustainable development committee minutes block fill Clearwater will second all those in favor against that 's carried ok so then moving to item 10 so I 'll bypass item 8 will deal that when we deal with that when the mayor arrives so moving to item 10 the draft submission of the question of City Council on the local government community well-being amendment bill item 10 on page 65 are there any questions for staff on this we 've invited any questions to be provided or any changes to be provided prior to the meeting and nothing was received so we have a resolution to approve the draft submission which I 'm happy to move do I have a second and Mike Davidson is there any debate on this Glen and film Glen very pleased to see the scope through at the time the full well-beings were removed from the LGA I think the entire local government sector opposed it they went hood and for me the step today takes us a step forward in terms of central government listening to local we 've really come through quite and might be a shameful period open season was declared on councils I remember not only this instance but one where a minister stack a politic district plans behind him having a go at all the councils over land provision and housing and that did not go down well with local councils I also note that we consider this paper today and the context of the news of elections coming back for a can which which is great to see it can was can as you know back in 2010 and so it 's been quite some time since we 've had democracy for our Regional Council 's so I 'm thrilled that this is going through I have heard of mentioned in one quarter that we explore the possibility of some kind of covenant or treaty between central and local government so that a great deal more respect is actually built into the the kind of framework between central and local I 've never seen so many attacks local government is I have and the last nine years so I 'm thrilled that this is going through today the full well beings and the DC charge for these facilities which we must so I 'm sure we 'll all vote and payment thank you film and think you look I 'd certainly endorse what clean has seen about supporting the staff but the staff have written I think it 's it 's a very good submission I certainly recall and most of you will when the fall well beings were taken out by a previous government was like a real assault on local government in terms of our well-being and I 'm very pleased that the these this new bill will restore those well beings yeah in like an example too of we I think local government have missed out and have have had to pay a lot more was because that was a the narrowing of development contributions and how they might be able to be collected by our councils and so that in effect I think did do great harm in terms of adding to the costs of every council throughout New Zealand so I think Ian and the staff for this preparing a submission and I 'm very happy to support it I think it 's really really swell beans get put back and obviously when they 'll taken out in 2012 by the national government it was aimed at trying to rein in the so-called overspending by local governments to try and actually fill a lot of the need within community but I think what it really does show I guess is actually councils the funding we get through rates and other mechanisms is just not enough to provide what we need to provide to actually put in quality infrastructure and also support communities appropriately or properly so this is actually a really good step but it needs to go further in terms of actually the money we get the funding we get the revenue we get and how we therefore can distribute it properly across our communities and to our city to make sure that we meet all the needs I largely agree with the reinstatement of the well bangs I just wanted to draw council 's attention to the changes to the development contributions and that is the reinstatement of the of a wider definition which I think is because of the earthquake and the change coming in just after the earthquake meaning that we actually lost out on millions of dollars going towards providing from the growth to us at each other to the needs that we had to provide the infrastructure so really welcome that we just had a deputation the other day from the people and welcome and you know to think that a brand-new development with many many houses goes in and tints of housing goes into that community without any ability to for that developer to pay and contribute to the plot the local playground being upgraded seems to me absolutely unfair and and you know that development contribution may have been going to other things out and halls wall or for the north of the city but it doesn 't go back into that local community that 's bearing the impact of that development so you know I welcome the changes to the development contributions definition and also the other thing that we 're asking for in our submission which is again long overdue has been to have a much clearer infringement regime and enforce some of our bylaws that we have to go through a very complicated expensive prosecution like through the courts rather than have the ability to give out infringement and so you know I think the benefit of those twofold one it would enable us to have bylaws that we could enforce a lot easier a lot more cost-effective but also it doesn 't criminalize people for breaching our Bibles as well so you know I think there 's a real advantage to to having their infringement regime refined and I think it would be a lot a lot better for us in terms of how we how we run the city so I welcome the staff submission we support it today very good there anyone else we 're good I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried thank you should we just do the draft submission on the privacy bill and then we 'll go back to the one that was deferred while I was at meeting the heads of mission from different parts of the world so drafts motion Andrew second does Mike any discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried now we 'll go back to the number eight number eight okay now um stuff do you want to just make a quick overview of the why why are we doing this and just a just a brief synopsis of the of the history and how we 've got to this this point in time and I know counselors have got some questions for you okay so that this sketch this is in response to resolution by the great Christchurch partnership there 's some real time to take this process in this manner is addressing the requirements of the national policy statement there 's requires us to develop a future development strategy in bits because we are one of the one of the partners of the greater crime no and one other high-growth here 's the high growth area so this is a legal requirement and uncertainty yep thank you in terms of the history as be familiar that we 've had a future an update provided to that strategy to sort of bring it into today 's environment but what that didn 't do is look at some of the land use aspects and so as recognized we needed to do that and it 's now being done in conjunction with the obligation that we have to do it coming out of the national policy statement it 's also updated and our population projections that happens every few years and so this also be a direct response to of those in some suppose new detailed aspects that we have to cover through addressing any shortfalls and propellant capacity is looking not just at location which the Utes and their district plans tend to look at but also looking at matters such as typology in price point so meeting the demand the particular price points in particular type apologies which we haven 't and the past had to go down to that detail so that 's quite important when you consider the huge demand for affordable housing into the future right okay so questions okay so given that it need to address the demand be in the demand for social housing given the lack of ownership and given the statistics which show that ownership of housing has dropped dramatically and there is a huge wave of people who will come to age 65 and not own a house and who will need social housing can this also address given that it 's mostly about so when I 'm WiMAX since our district scheme is done can it also address the need for the social infrastructure and so and so on and WiMAX so that those demands don 't all fall on just the city as they currently do so it 's not about selling it 's about the greater Christchurch area the future development strategy so to be clear it does cover Christchurch City and it does cover the required demand for affordable housing including social housing so that 's a component of it and yes it does include the demand that can be met and so how Selwyn and why Matt can contribute to it as well meeting that demand it 's us across if we said well that must cover this beyond I think what there 's there 's some confusion that the proposed changes to the original policy statement almost you might consider it as an interim change to that that 's been purported to just look at the site Selwyn and why Matt medium to him shortfall that 's what that is about so there is a proposal to consider or to undertake a session duty to analysis to look at a proposed change to the Ric Canterbury regional policy statement but that 's actually a secret mission yes I 've tried to explain in a very short paragraph that there are two tracks and it 's a separate process and actually we 've probably got a greater issue that we need to address in terms of the regional policy statement change and ensuring that it is focused on the length of term that it 's intended to be focused on and not ending up and the long term really yeah just to be very clear at the moment the demand for social infrastructure force on the city so when and why met do not meet the any of the what I just want to be very clear on is that you 've talked about affordable housing which is great for those who can afford to buy a house but for those who can 't that they will have the ability to remain in their community when they need social housing and that it will be provided and that if we have the capacity in this to push for it that it is included specifically so just to be very clear yes so as part of that said another one of the outcomes we the city would be expect that 's my met through the proposed change the Canterbury regional policy statement even looking at the medium tune that they provide that they provide for the range of housing typology such that would provide for more affordable housing and so then it comes down to density affordable and both mental event social housing now the Canterbury regional policy statement is not the mechanism to it depends how far you expect the Canterbury region a policy statement to go in terms of dealing directly to social housing and if the Canterbury document it is only in juice so Len juice and yeah I mean it 's more about density than it has about you know with who owns that the the house that whether it 's social housing or whether it 's as well social housing as a mechanism to address various thirty persistent but this is a future development strategy we know the issue we know that all of the Selwyn and Womack issues come into the city at the moment what I 'm trying to ensure is that affordable for many people looking forward will be social housing sorry to say but that is the reality so does it actually and can it specifically include that so I 'm sorry to persist with it but yes so the future determine it 's a direct response to the national policy statement that urban development capacity within there it is up to the grated cottage partnership how far it wishes to go in terms of providing maybe actions or implementation as part of that that would address lot to begin to address the measure of purpose the short answer is yes recommendations such that when it goes back to the committee greater Christchurch partnership that it specifically at least was the part of the feedback that would go into the development of the draft yes so can we just never could we have a noting recommendation noting another noting which says that notes that the the city would have an expectation that social housing will be will be a component of of of all three solutions of the three of the two districts as well as the city yep yep proponent of the two districts what the two districts yeah no but the two districts are more yes oh no but that you trying to say we provide for the greater Christchurch area there are two districts that that have border christchurch city here christchurch the city will have any expectation that will be a component of the two districts as well as Kruschev city okay Yani thank you um so when we previously discuss this I thought we agreed to approach the minister all the ministers from the previous government when this came in around why we were being asked recovery plan and we 've done a district plan review came with Donna UDS refresh flash update we did we did we actually the Greater Christchurch partnership meet with the minister and and specifically requested that we not meet these timeframes but I have to say that that the the the there is no time left not to proceed so just something clear so that was the previous go on my current one so the current government still wants us to do this there has been no change the timelines from the car yeah and have we got a process to to actually logically go back to them and say we 're concerned we 've just had all this work done in this area and we 're just having to duplicate well it 's not a duplication because it is actually I mean as I say there 's a there 's a link to the other stream of work but it is a requirement to do it we 're in the high growth category and the high growth category as as significantly driven off why my career Ian 's cell start playing and the changes to the regional policy statement only dealt with growth to 2028 mmm we have to deal with birth to 2048 also to do any integrator planning with transport we have to look at the land use or the development capacity requirements to 2048 to support any joint position or land use in transport and a lot of that works already been done through the UTS yeah and I think government have recognized that if the works been done then the job becomes that much smaller so we cover cloth accordingly but what we do is we ensure that the strategy brings through that wealth of work that 's been done to show we don 't need to do too much more so I 'm just trying to understand like the possible outcome of this doing it through greater Christchurch partnership does it have to be done through the Greater Christchurch partnership or could we just do this as a City Council absolutely has to be at a greater Christchurch level because it 's has regional significance see the impact of growth and Selman and why the huge challenge of affordable housing and it 's a greater crisis just as a legal requirement or whether it 's no right so we could choose to do it as a city we can but it 's strongly strongly recommends we especially when we 've got an established Utes which is looking at addresses the greater criteria but it strongly advises their councils where they 're particularly is crossover boundary issues that they work together to address the urban growth issues but can I just say this is the scoping paper this is not the draft that 's going out for public consultation and getting of the probably no and you know it it was it was made very clear you know and I 'm you know acknowledged Sarah Templeton as the one of the representatives on the Greater Christchurch partnership absolutely crystal clear that it was to come back to us so the original staff recommendation that went to the urban devour Greater Christchurch partnership was that this council delegate the decision-making to the Greater Christchurch partnership we 've said no and a case was made and that what I 'm giving an undertaking to today is that we will root shop the draft in detail before it comes back to Council for a decision this is the scoping paper but this is the start of this process and I believe once we agree to this and ratify it then it 's very hard to change some key elements of it now for some of us who have had history with the UTS and what we saw was the community wanted us not to go and spread out into the green fields that was overwhelming from the public submissions but because of the decision making process on it it basically didn 't that wasn 't the outcome over what the outcome was was urban sprawl at the expense of more dense population in the in the central city and in the inner city and what we had as a result is huge motorways being built and what we 've seen since CDs has come in a lack of focus on a all in social housing there were actions around that in the in the UDS and they were providing infrastructure to the turbines to support urban sprawl which led to the motorways being built and so what I 'm concerned about is the decision-making around us the question is really if are we confident that the decision-making around us is going to give lead to the best outcomes for the city as opposed to our neighboring territorial authorities who seem to have everything to gain from this and we seem to have the most to lose can I just say that it 's that there 's a parallel process that that we need to be briefed on and we need to work through a number of those issues this is not the forum this is not the place for that but you know I mean I I can 't persuade you around the council table and I think we just need to move on and accept that it 's the scoping I promise that there will be a workshop before we consider the draft and the second question was around the housing targets that are mentioned in this report have they been sick or when do they get a kind of in this process over you that we 've got we 've got this is sequential parallel work components how we got a kind of understanding of the process for agreeing certain things sorry how do you mean well like things like the minimum housing targets for example right it 's just not clear from from me from reading the US around how we actually make decisions around things like the minimum housing targets whether that 's the hearings panel that gets to do it no part of the workshop part of the process and as part of the technical work that the staff are doing sorry I 'll turn around us in who makes the decisions well finally they come back to Emily come to yes so the future developers are here but you can swim in it will help with them at the minimum targets yes to be fear it 's not actually clear which goes the minimum targets have to be put onto the canterbury regional policy statement by december this year ideally the future development strategy gets signed off and the company is part and then so that 's decided by each authority and then it gets put into the original policy say clean you Thank You zerah great to see the drill down to price points and typology and I 'm just wondering with what sits behind this discussion is it a principle which we pick up on and Christchurch 's sorry crush it city 's own housing policy that being inclusionary zoning so obviously you know explicitly affordable housing development has provided for of which social housing itself as a subset so what would be if this is the scoping and it 's about land use is this the place to begin that conversation was that further on with the the actual workshop and drive yes I think we need to do also what document is best to take on what yeah what aspect of it some of it might be in the students future development strategy might be signaling through the work to be required it can 't solve everything but I certainly consider maybe a program of work or some initiatives by which to solve the problem we look towards most appropriate way to actually bring that to you as a well getting done to date what wants to be done and what other options are there to take efficiencies a place yeah if we had a discussion over eg 25 percent would be you know affordable and in our land use that yeah okay great do we need to note that today near or as well do you think sorry what was that just noting inclusionary zoning as a part of that conversation over social has some D on thank you in the in the document is a little part around the the integration with other processes and it 's Central City and Haven auto cut and well the diamond River corridor quite interesting to note that actually it says that the regeneration plan is likely to be released for consultation and whist which is nice tonight um as far as it was it 's nice to find out in these reports but the thing I 'm worried about is does this type of thing over or supersede the work that 's actually already going to be done so that 's been going on for the regeneration strategy and they say no we don 't want any buildings to be built in there and then all of a sudden you get this thing going over top and so actually we think we need some growth in these areas and we 're going to sort of test the boundaries or something so just a clarification the there 's a public exhibition that begins the Saturday on otaku everyone a call within that there is theory at the extent of the work that 's been undertaken part of that is saying the fact that there 's very limited opportunity for residential development so so really the outcome of that work is to say that whilst we can expect you know these opportunities to do some innovative new housing it won 't be of the scale that would probably put any a drop in the bucket of what to meet this demand that actually is required so this is just saying they 're not going to those other things yeah but what I 'm saying here is that we 're doing you work over here in the regeneration strategy this is gonna come in over top and if and if the people who are doing this don 't agree with that strategy they can actually say something over top and actually sort of you know start developing with the team only on the I 've talked about even River so I 'm fully aware of what opportunities were available in that land and that has that 's actually part we actually work quite closely it 's not this one I suppose the future development strategy is looking for opportunities of where to house people that 's one of the fundamental you know outcomes that CVS do so in what it looks to us to say well in that corridor is there any opportunity and the outcome of their work that 's been no that 's quite limited but it may present some as I see it some enough ideas for maybe a fort more affordable housing but it 's not going to be at the scale when you look at the numbers again it will come back to a workshop on us to try and provide for it 's quite significant so and I mean and that 's that 's the challenge ahead that a future development strategy has to tackle Paul in sorry thank you my questions are on transport and it 's also about integration so that we know that if we are in a that stated here that the strategic transport direction is set out in these documents will provide an important contribution for these your statement however we know that when the GPS transponders been prioritized over land use in other words then you should occur around existing transport routes and for efficiencies in functionality so is this I mean it 's a chicken Milanese it 's not a particularly think that we didn 't actually supports the priority of transport yeah yes I mean if the the part of the if you go back to the UTS strategic directions that 's that 's quite clearly stated their transport and land use have to be integrated that 's actually one of that 's part of the vision that 's part of strategic goals it 's part of everybody ethnicity so thought beyond any occasion I thought as being aligned is first and then the Lin you around the existing routes so yes the same team that is working on the DP the same team that 's working on the Salukis and so yes we having those very conversations within the team with littler team structures that are developing this which one drives which and this certainly is looking as pattern again when I come back to what is the one of the salt outcomes of this is where do we house people where do we have people in the best location to support those public transport corridors and so forth so that that is actually at one of the key principles of developing that fds is very fun to Sarah thank you thank you just two quick things firstly if the the later the last credit crisis companionship meeting we asked again about the UM the the feasibility tests in the timeframes in whether we had formally written to get those potentially changed so the feasibility tests on how feasible the assessments see how feasible the developer and to the minister because we 've had some fruitful discussions with officials so now we hadn 't so we wanted to the letter to be crafted in a way that was positive and had solutions relevant problems and so we can report those separately in terms of what those positive discussions have led to probably the next committee meeting okay but we think there 's now a much better understanding between government and local government about what 's the pragmatic way of dealing with these issues and the other one just quickly and would we fear to say they 're taking with our question at the beginning but it 'd be fair to say hey they affect that all of the councils need to ratify this at the very end of the process means that both Selwyn and Waimakariri need to also make sure that they do things in a way that will get our sign-off yes yeah very much yeah Erin yes Oh mine 's just it 's just a double-barreled question and most of their reports we often have the financial implications so know how much it 's my questions around what is the cost of all of this and then what 's the measurable outcomes at the end so predominantly the costs are in staff time so we have will the staffing consultants who picks up all the bail for the consultants because I noticed in the the break down our if T is a 3.5 but others are just putting in point three with the exception of the key no just because this projects being dealt with collaboratively the budget and counsels contribute to the partnership itself from the running the partnership will pay for the costs associated with this project it 's primarily to write a document there has been some evidence-based work that 's occurred already but what you 've got in front view is is minimal cost its implications are huge but then they 're picked up through district plans and LTPS and that 's where you 're making the actual decisions on those costings okay okay oh sorry just one more question it 's not on housing and but it is on the fact that this goes through to 2048 by which just about carbon neutral so how to and if you look at the latest Productivity Commission report there is a massive impact on land use how does climate change and the effects of it apart from coastal hazards factored into this I mean it 's got this one of the issues that 's raised and I suppose because this is fundamentally a lien do some transport directive document there its whilst again it may refer to future programs of work or initiatives being there as focuses on land use and transport that would be where we 'd have to see some initiatives that are going towards carbon again it 's one of the strategic goals priorities I can 't remember directions of the UDS currently into the you know we expect that bet it 's going to be carried through and therefore it will have to show an action plan towards this is this is the framework so can we add a note that that there is an expectation that the current strategic framework of the Utes including its focus on climate change as is carried through into the future the social housing you speak with regards to cell one and why make they 're going through their LTP as we are we know what their component and their with regards to social housing is because if this is a future document and we are a partnership no we take pride in our social housing we have issues and at the moment all I can say that they have none and they have none in their LTP there 's a ten-year document with with implications further on so do we know if they or can we look at that to see if what how long they 're going to be and therefore how much they 're going to put on after mass a neguin if they met focus of or an expectation now that we address that as part of the FDS then we can realize be asking that of them I have raised that this issue with the Minister about the lack of connection between the timeframes so we do an L deep LTP and then we go into a regional transport plan and go into a public transport after the LTP so I think that we wouldn 't have an expectation that that outcomes in relation to this process and the that they 're going through a district plan review both of them as well at the moment so that would carry on for quite some time it would be disappointing to see our partners and us not having any vision over social housing because right but it hasn 't been raised with them it hasn 't been raised with them you know what I 'm saying is that we can 't look to the LTP what we can do is we can say that crush each city has an expectation that social housing will be a component of the two districts as well as crush its city we can talk that through with them and we can look at the about the LTP proposal to see and if there is nothing and there with regards to social house and we could ask but timing subversion timing it 's the wrong way you know that 's what I keep saying they 're doing their LTP now yeah you version of them doing and responsible for social housing then we can ask in what their vision was so we have a better understanding of what our partners are expecting in the future which is definitely the stuff that 's what we want today seems to have been falling off the wagon so to speak but it hasn 't been raised with them that 's what I 'm saying is chicken indeed important and with saying it 's so important for surprises yeah Jonnie just obviously housing issues come up quite a lot my understanding is that they 're supposed to go to crush each housing policy is that in place or will that be in place to inform this targets these targets and so is a priority action in the update it hasn 't been progressed as yet we 've kind of been focused on some of this immediate work that 's got statutory deadlines but it 's still a desire as expressed in their 2016 update and I think the City Council 's housing policy forms a good platform to picking up on the point late you know housing provision now as well we 've got an action to do something that could render Greater Christchurch housing policy it hasn 't been done and now being asked to look at targets without doing that policy could it be done as part of this so that we had that kind of common understanding across government and across the region as we were supposed to have done in the greater crisis update last from my side as Sarah said it given that this has got a land use transport focus I think there 'll be elements that we can pick up in in that but then there 'll be other elements that are in the housing policy at a cross level that once it easily in in the document with we 're in front of us but could be signaled as actions and programs of work to take forward it 's kind of like the ways it best press progress he 's saying I think that falls out of this document yes you 've heard the concerns like for some of us you know it 's going back to the seems to be the last cab off the rank which never seems to regress on that in 2006 or 2007 that 's when the UDS was developed we had an earthquake since then there have been changes made to it through the land use recovery plan and it had to be adapted as a result of those changes that were made not all of those changes were acceptable to the council but they were changes that were made under a framework that we had nothing to do with we have a statutory deadline to meet with this this is the scoping document can we please leave these bigger questions to when we actually address the draft that 's going to go out for public consultation if it ever does thank you sorry moved move by Sarah sickened a bad film there any discussion I 'll pop them up okay we 're going to have to move on to another item on the agenda because we 've got such a short timeframe further if we 're going to all debate it again after questions then can we I know that I we show you another ailee 's yes no another I just want to deal with the in traffic strategy and then come back to it okay just until I order lean because clearly we 're going to have a workshop on this it made I don 't feel when it compelled to debate it today yeah but it doesn 't matter people are entitled to debate it so I 'm sorry team Kate can you hang around and can I invite the team together forward for the Antarctic strategy paper and we 'll move on to there I just know that these are is a constraint in terms of some time right good afternoon now this has been through the innovation and sustainable development committee so I invite the chair of the committee to introduce the report so this has gone through a workshop and then to the committee and this is the result of what 's come and the whole thing was redrafted and I have to say it 's been redrafted I think extremely well by Christchurch NZ and it 's it 's what we 've now arrived of the Antarctic strategy in terms of the the economic impact that in tactical has on Christchurch but tried to capture some of the sort of the magic of the history of Antarctic exploration in terms of the impact that it has on Christchurch people and if you look through everything in Christchurch there are so many aspects of Antarctica that are here and it 's almost in our DNA I mean it 's one of the was originally part of onto an island of course and it 's got we 've made sure that we 've covered the environment all the sustainability but also all of the practical issues of being a gateway city and some of the excitement that goes with it and tried to share some of that excitement with the people of Christchurch so this is a continent of course that 's got no government which is pretty exciting exciting and itself it 's had no wars it 's it 's an amazing place if you 've ever been near there the feeling as you fly back into Christchurch of the explosion of color having looked incredible but Christchurch is one of the very few places where people can actually get there so the University of Canterbury for example who do those amazing courses that enable people to go to Antarctica just incredible and so what has been tried to be put together and I think quite very well here is the succinct sort of development of all of the aspects of Enter to go inherit feeds and to the economy the environment the sustainability the excitement the magic and the possibility that exists here so that 's what Joanna and her team have tried to do I think they 've done a very good job and it 's been through the committee and I think we 've arrived at something that 's cool has anyone got any questions first out yep of Christchurch in seat no no no it would be shame so you 'd like to second us so it 's been moved and seconded moot by folkies seconded by Tim yani Jimi 's before just one of what happens and years two and three and if there 's any reporting that dates for councils so I 'm not quite clear how it reports back on a regular basis and um just for the sake I 'll just add the second question which is related as are we able to get the international relations Working Party having like a six monthly update or or reporting so that you know endorse what 's in here but I just want to understand how they govern still as counselors wider international working relationship if I can systems of reference for Vicky 's committee execs only in Turku so reporting back I imagine would be by that committee came at least you counsel wish to change you know maybe could be doing me done but yeah and then the second thing was so in terms of like individual plans that get developed will they come back to Council or they 'll just set with crusher Shunzhi so they 'd only come back to Council if they head to that obviously be shared with stakeholders which obviously includes the council generally individual implementation plans would only come up to the food Council if if that amount of delegation or strategy and a statement in to depend on a certain today and the the first question was the years two and three if you go to your action plan it kind of it 's great it 's got you want outcomes then it skips the year for a lot of detail on you well a lot of that detail is about developing plans into the future we wanted to reflect a clear indication of momentum and to that ten-year horizon but those plans of year one for example looking at the opportunities around the visitor attraction and house and visitor experience will be will inform a detailed plan for years towards room and then term would be reflected back into the annual statement of intent new records are chemi Thank You Me At two pages first time we got into the page 30 the pair was sixth on the 8th I just want to know who are those that his strategy partners and stakeholders coalition accepted most of the agencies particular I 'd review latecha 33 Sula our priority one two party for their culture NZ CIA here these written involved in Easter in tactical strategy so you 're asking Jimmy I think around who attended especially the paragraph 6.8 refers to the workshop that was run by Costas indeed with 22 participants in so you 'd like to know who those agencies with yes yeah so they have broad support and their kitchens in the in the strategy so in the back page of the strategy document itself will refuse to the stakeholders engaged with during the process if you like we could doing numerous stakeholders organizations and individuals that workshop okay yes may they 're on page 40 and 41 yet I 'll go check okay second question I follow the Chancellor Jana your hands equation because this Antarctica kinda often region should be the part of the white churches international relationship contacts you and also a moment in council we didn 't have the international relations working group we have the cancerous we have eight key strategic partnership representatives so we provide a strategical oversight in the advice so my questions why these the entitled charity not a presenter Lisa walking cool to give the the strategical for the innovation and sustainable development committee include the Antarctic related work so that 's what came through that committee I imagine going forward knowing that we 're looking to come up with a new international relations strategy in association with your working group and up to Council that anything in tactic related would would be captured within there and obviously worked with Christ 's teachings even Becky 's committee can I just suggest Joe are you okay if we have a thing that suggests that you report back every six months to the committee and we invite the International Relations Committee to it that the members of no prob really useful dialogue just so I fully understand the purpose of the workshop would be to review levels of service just another thing and I think it 's an indirect so we could add that or we 'll just do that a moment in cultured City Council we did have existing international relations of policy but if we reveal this policy or establish in poo palace for the near future we are proceeding but exist in the international relationship the might be great yeah Sarah I 'm just quickly because the sort of a lot of the Civic international function will still set within the City Council because of you know the status on the ailing me operationally how that works when you look at 5.19 with the budget do you need the entire because some of that function is still sitting within Council does all of the office budget have to go to Christchurch New Zealand so firstly reiterate something that I see that the committee so the jean.we the strategy has been drafted with the view that the lead agency would because it 's easy to capture all of the synergies the budget that we referred to in paragraph five point 19 is the Antarctic office related budget which is is not every budget would like to be bigger so it is absolutely in teaching at Civic international relations team in particular but all of council work with Christ 's teachings Eve and M committing us so that synergies of our other operations in particularly Christine 's it would be used to the max in the civic and is a key part of that collaboration does that answer your question yeah yes although that was going to cost us stall the staff time and money and those are there involved anyway so so we if they 're not currently coming out of it coming out of normal Council for operations so that the involvement of us quite often events that co-hosted or involving manage of things for this perfect tactic part other so therefore that costs are borne between the two so we 'd be of those both in the entire office if you like and a silicon international relations and penny on you 've in Rimini visits which include multiple I just wonder whether it would be useful to actually and include a reference to the sand the second resolution so approved the responsibility for Antarctic office being transferred to christchurch NC together with accompanying funding effective SF 1 July 2018 noting and this is taking it from the paper that that working closely with the council particularly the mayor 's office and the Civic own international relations team will be an important part of the ongoing committee as well but we 're in a much more public public forum here and the last time we passed a strategy that we enter questions it was the event strategy and that sort of receipt as it was and then within a couple of months you know you came back and said well this is all good but if you want us to do it properly we need more money is that going to happen here so we 've developed a strategy with the clear intention that it will fit within the fiscal envelope developed with and the LTP thank you very much do we need to have a a reporting format included in the resolution because I mean often reporting doesn 't necessarily occur at least there 's a trigger for it so I just wonder if we if we have requests christchurch you can see to report on a six monthly basis we 're really comfortable to the innovation and sustainability committee who will invite the international relations we can group to be part of that workshop yeah is everyone happy okay now it 's been moved debate I will put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed oppose they know that is carried unanimously thank you well done good work right now we 'll turn back to something that doesn 't quite go so smoothly and we are up to the debate now who wants to debate this it was glean Yanni and Dion what you don 't need to come back to the table if you don 't want to because we 're up to the debate the odd staff has tried to participate from time to time but I assure you you won 't want to infill all right clean Thank You me just a few notes here just over this obviously looking forward to the draft but just a wee story when the Preston 's development was included the two been outside the red line so it was included after the quakes after you know considerable housing unit loss it was touted in many quarters as being affordable and obviously prices in there will vary friends of ours paid 750 all up for land and housing so tell me how way of tools if this is about land use while I do support obviously the note over social housing I think we need the board at all which would or could be inclusionary zoning which takes in social housing obviously it takes an affordable housing social housing is a subset of that we need to do this we know from one of the advisors at least to the Housing Minister Shem Nabila cubed that New Zealand flatlined with its social housing building in 1991 and that flatlined in house construction total which would have resulted in a squeeze in terms of supply thereby forcing prices up over time so we need to look ahead as vicki has said we have a big baby boomer bubble coming through and we 're going to be caught out if we want Christchurch and Canterbury to be an attractive place to live work and play sometimes you have to do the boring stuff like housing and we need to ensure that housing will be affordable for for people to come here and settle so I I really hope that when we do get that real opportunity to make some change but we can 't just talk about social housing more affordable we actually have to have a at all otherwise you 're just hoping and it 's an arbitrary thing unless you impose some kind of at all in my view that 's not going to happen so I 'm looking forward to their opportunity when it comes our way thank you yeah Leigh to speak in support of cancer Livingstone he may not be aware that in 2007 the Greater Christchurch Urban development 's trilogy had a top 20 priority actions action number 15 carry out a study of housing affordability options around inclusive zoning increasing the stock of social housing partnerships with developers and monitoring the supply and demand of affordable housing at local and regional levels so this stuff is not new this has been around for a number of years now but what we seem to keep doing is using this process to try and deal with bigger issues around housing which seems to be just the idea that we just free up more land more of a versatile soils the same time not giving the development around policies in place to actually get social housing spirit being spread equally and equitably across our region so what we 're seeing is a whole desire free up land for as my councillor colleague has said for quite expensive housing choices for some but not for many and probably we don 't know but I would guess that we 've enabled fewer people to own more houses rather than enabling more people to own a house so we 've basically continued to I think through these strategies enable the rise of inequality and inequity in our society because it always seems that these business principles of bringing up more land for development is good and what we see is that the social cost of that is borne by those who can least afford it so I 'm really concerned about this process I personally think a reflection on previous urban development strategy has been that it didn 't respond to what the community wanted because of the governance arrangements the decision that were being asked to make today continues to enshrine those don 't think gives us a good outcome for our city what it leads to as hundreds of millions of dollars being spent on motorways connecting you know so in my Mac to our city enabling more development to happen on our very precious soils where actually we 've got huge issues in terms of the loss of those versatile soils and huge issues in terms of traffic coming into our central city like Cranford Street where we 're spending millions and millions of dollars completely contrary to what 's happening in our inner city so I can 't support this I would have really preferred to have a workshop on it I don 't believe that this governance structure gets the best outcome for everyone and as such I think it 's ludicrous that we 're spending time and resource on a document that seems to have more benefit for someone and why mate than ourselves deal I just wanted to speak briefly on why why I won 't be voting for support to support this as well mainly it 's around I just do not think that this think we 've just done a lot done the district plan that we 're locked into at the moment is a whole lot of other issues that we need to deal with in the city and I just do not see from reading it that this is a priority for the City Council at the moment and that 's just why I won 't be voting for it so countess I will be supporting it I think as we we know that under commander air current law in fact as a council we required to work collaboratively with the other territory authorities and we should do that future development strategy it 's part of what we have to do and I think we 've got an opportunity to do it well that this is really just asked asking for the initial scoping paper to be done around the extent of land and Christchurch which will be required for housing and like it as we know besides that coming back to our Council for ratification the scoping paper the whole thing will go out for consultation so we have it is to some of the the recent legislation we had for example around the loop where we as councils all of us were required to do the land-use pinning the way the way developed and I can understand the concerns around urban sprawl and what and what has happened and in the taking up of green space as against the intensification of as a greater Christchurch which in fact the the herb the urban development strategy was designed to do but I think we need to really work with this process and as Pauline has indicated it clearly needs to fit alongside the transport plan for glide across Greater Christchurch as well and that we have to make sure that that in fact that doesn 't remain a sticking point we know for example that most of the most of the people who are employed in Greater Christchurch come in to Christchurch City for their employment we have to make sure that in fact that transport planning works well alongside where air future housing will be Sara thank you it 's just really good to remember with us it is it make sure that the the draft comes back to Council again before it goes out the consultation we 've been through the UDS process we know that people understand that we can 't have unlimited growth on to our versatile soils my feeling is that this will come back simply affirming the position that we already have and our partner councils and Selma and Weimer cadet I do understand the big picture although they have their own local challenges and they are aware that they will need our Buy and to get through any changes that they want it will come back we will workshop it it is a legislative requirement we have to do it we need some changes to the feasibility test because I think it 's got about a 20% development profit sort of thing and here at the moment which a lot of developers in they 're not looking at that and different ways of doing developments organizations like ohoo and things aren 't taken into account through this this process at all we legally need to do this we need to make the best of breath just a very quick statement look I mean this is just another strategy planning document that the big problem the city has as many cities in New Zealand also have is how to build houses that is the problem and I think that 's what people should be focusing their energy on thank you I 'll put the motion then all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried so who opposed Yanni Aaron and Dylan thank you right now we move on to the metropolitan discretionary response fund is it right and we have the the three grants there now this did this go no it doesn 't go to a committee so would someone like to move the the grants Tim Sikandar by Glen right are there any questions the cottage emerging theatres trois we paid written staff costs and I just want to clarity because I know we 'd previously funded the great the deca mission to do the work I think I read that in the report we already funded through another fund so can you just help me understand that 2016 to help establish them in the art centers and it was a contribution towards the foot out of initial contribution to rent in wages and that was by the creative industries support fund and there 17 financial year but it 's not our funded we just administer is our son it is now it 's about creative communities is the one that okay the cabbie m30 know so you know it 's the 2016-17 financial yeah right okay and you know I would really like to give them the full amount because I think of Christchurch doesn 't really support this but they 've never asked for me before and it seems to be quite a significant project I 'm wondering why the available balance of the discretionary response and they could look at the creative communities scheme which is the one we administer on behalf of creative New Zealand yeah so they they do have the opportunity to come through that and they they know how to do this they know they 've been given a you know some guidance a bit he 's speaking in there great quite clear I 'm done clarify the response because in the report it doesn 't mention the funding history of this particular group and so it goes on to say that funding support was for staff wages and rent during the establishment suppose in the Art Center so sorry you 're going back to the other one yeah yeah sorry any had moved on from that so we 're going back to right you 're right to point that out that as an era so the skirt it isn 't the two productions theater company it 's a separate globe so two productions theater company see production house they also have the emerging leader trust as their charitable arm so the production company is who delivers the productions and events and holds the lease view in order for them to be able to come for funding to router creative museum andean council they also need a trust so hints the application under that name and we 've already funded them to be established so why is it saying that this is continuing second question why is it and the report 's it 's to support the ongoing establishment in the art center so they 've been there for a year and what we know is with a number of the arts organizations that we support that we 've is generally a degree of of hand-holding from funders for anywhere up to three years for those looking at a business model approach which is what this organization is looking at okay so it 's been moved and seconded I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much and I think going out up to the resolution to reduce it to exclude the public and we 've got Monica Maronna Romina nada to remain for 1922 that they want to deal with my to me 22 resilience view that we deal with the community resilience partnership fund paper and the open meeting if that 's a general view we 'll just take it out of the resolution and we 'll just go on to us we 're happy with it the end just as so long as staff have gone through yeah but I think people should just be careful in terms of questions breaking into privacy issues in future will workshop them before we come to birth to a public consideration so it 's just yeah it 's just been a process that has followed a pattern rather than being considered so it could we go to item 20 and the PX agenda it 's not going into the PX agenda but that 's where you 'll find it and it could staff come to the table for that one been told that Andrew and I need to take no part in their housing first why well I was a bit in nonplussed as well touched me why because why but so the social council we are we all conflicted no no no I think I think I mean as it 's probably the most controversial of the of the elements and it 's I just don 't think that there 's a conflict there okay okay Jim just people note that we have two councillors that on the board of the Oh Toto here Community Housing Trust _''_6083.28 issue in relation to the housing crease proposal which is a measure in relation to a funding allocation rather than something that has been sought so okay so I think that probably rather than going to move these on block I just want to establish that people ask the questions that they want to ask on the on the individual elements of it so that we can then ascertain how we might how we might do this and there are two questions in relation to the housing first proposal that I have the first one is what what was this was the Christchurch housing first collaboration I suppose I 'll call it today ask the council to make a financial contribution to it and the second does does the government 's announcement in relation to a significant amount of additional money for the housing first model enable us to reconsider the amount that we might contribute council two thunders and my understanding is also that and no they can 't are the government 's contribution is to add more to the government side of numbers of people that they will social connection the connection and also working with the people that are on the streets as well officer working on on this isn 't here so they can 't upset question but that 's our understanding no that 's fine that that clears that up for me I 'm Sarah thank you I 've got a I 'm a process question um and I think this has been raised before doesn 't need an answer to it so that and the committee resolution to seek community resilience partnership funding was on the 22nd of February in a week later the council resolved to ask staff to report to the committee on all oh sorry council resolution was on the 22nd of February which asked staff to report on all council and external funding sources and the report was already written that was going to the committee which was there on the 4th of April and it only referenced potential council sources of funding and it referenced an earlier committee resolution and didn 't rent preferrence the council resolution at all so here 's a council resolution to look at external doing this ahead of that work there 's been a conversation with the Roger foundation but there has not been any other station so the council resolution staff I requested to report to the committee on all council and external options to help fund the proposed initiatives and then a week later the committee decided on accounts of one without looking at external ones are we able to look at external before it comes back yes we could do that yeah well I believe instruct us to do that yeah I mean that was the council resolution at the 22nd of February sorry I 've kind of um and I 've seen an email through last night and I braised it in an informal a couple of weeks ago hibernates while you were away yeah Dion Andrew so Mike yeah so my questions around and we 're that with who 's actually getting the money for for their housing the first one in the in the report it says the mission the crust reach me Methodist mission will will be the lead contractor in the in the program the mission blah blah blah then it just full stopped if fatty roy matter has been working in inner city east for over 20 years to fatty dog matter so it what I don 't get what funny dog mutters doing because it says the missions getting the money don 't want is a partner 's initiative the fund holder for this grant if it 's successful will be the city mission because they will that 's where the workers will be based it just it just reads in here as though that that 's just being copied and pasted and stuck in there don 't don 't see any other reference to to what they 're specifically doing so I 'm just wanting to understand what their involvement will be what the missions of involvement will be and how to actually who 's actually doing what the mission will be the base in the employer of the manager in because theater and this I said they 're moving the fund holder I 'm not sure talk about the other partners that are involved in this just I just want to know if that sentence has just been hopeful properly answering your questions is something missing there super funny and Zonk page one out for for anybody that wants to look at it sorry oh it 's on page 184 of the report yeah certainly and Tiffany just ate them being involved in the champions group and part of the wider network of agencies and organizations involved in the housing first project that 's the core for organizations fault or that the lead organizations will be in touch yeah but I 'm still within this report I 'm just trying to understand it 's all it almost as if like the mission has been has been written dear and then all of a sudden if I did or matter has been replaced in the sentence structures with the mission well instead of the mission they 're not just I 'm just confused if it 's at the top of page one eight five if you know what if you read it you 'll sort of see what I mean I 'm just really confused because it 's not very clear who 's okay sure in terms of them I mean if we 're I 've had 300,000 this needs to be very clear sure sure no it 's most evenly through the the machinery is the lead organization involved in the house including Spanish upon so I can 't really comment on exactly why the sentence structures like that and the reporter thing that 's just to somehow elude or make reference that other organizations involved oh so we 're pretty closely Anna Street and East yeah I 'm still quite confused I mean I 'm just reading it and it says that the lead contractors the Methodist motion and that they will be the employer of the community development worker and peer support worker and provide supervision training and support but if voting and Roy Mata will be well able to provide day-to-day support and guidance for the workers so it seems to me that the way it 's structured us to identify that they 'll be working alongside to study much that 's not very clear at all no I agree that the sentence structure is not very good but 's about contextual yeah Andrew it 's across NGOs we 're one of the NGO hot is the fund holder for collaboration across a number of NGOs rather than trying to spread out the money across several months a front order but all the partners involved in the direction mention which of the weaker Russia funders and in a partnership like you missed you require one plant holder we often do as well yeah Andrew thank you so the funding that we 're providing and there 's coming from this fund that would provide for the employment of the full time Community Development worker to part-time peer workers peer working capacity building and so on as detailed on the report presumably that is designed to reflect our role as a partner in this program that 's what we 've agreed to contribute to the program yes that 's correct so I mean is the proposal notes it 's it 's working in the whole community development community community connections area to help sustain the tendencies so that 's the the the additional extra value that council can provide in addition the events overseas shows the more that you can work with with folks to reinforce develop and sustain those community connections within the neighborhood the better off the better chance of success in the long run you have just following on from that if additional funding were able to be sourced from another provider such as writer or some other funder that funding wouldn 't necessarily be applied to this aspect of the program my understanding is the more funding that 's available to the program and I think that 's what this was reflected in the answer around government funding the more funding supplied to the program as a whole the more homeless people can can benefit from the program it 's still 50 although I think there 's an argument to be made that you you would have a greater throughput or access if you can sustain people and their tendencies within the community so in other words the only lease long term support through the housing first partnership partnership work in perhaps Paul just might comment about what I 'm going to say is correct was just do in the beginning of April the report there looks at the funding sources as was requested in the at the different council funding sources and the decision of the committee was to support the community resilience partnership fund the there is reference in the report too though to saying there 's note with a known known sources of X knowing sources of external funding that council could have access to to support the program but the partnership could apply independent sources such as router foundations been mentioned so there was the committee were aware of possible sources but then what what the report really said I guess implied was that council wouldn 't usually apply for funding on behalf of other agencies I 'm just making their comment and who might be me out as to whether or not the report that I 'm reading is accurate I 'll need to defer to colleagues closely associate I think that it 's not an consistent what 's the point though that the series raised which is that that we were to look to external ones and so you 're saying 't no I 'm saying that there weren 't no sources of external funding that council could could access yes but I don 't know that that was the intention of the resolution on the 22nd of February I think the intention of the resolution of the 22nd of February was in the spirit of the collaboration of their actual housing first thing itself was to look for external sources of funding to support it and partnership with the council so but I 'm getting some advice on that Mike Mike the actual initial request was for I think six hundred thousand over three years but the funding for this fund was available for the two years so I split it over the two years with an option to extend it of if need be the two months before they 'll only use two hundred thousand and if we 'll keep a hundred thousand sort of the host three hundred thousand be used up in year one I don 't know sorry it does this fund allow therefore for that money to be carried over years um my I Vicki has 50 people without this and then at the end of the time of adding another three hundred thousand per annum we still has 50 people so in terms of the bigger biggest best use of housing first I would have thought it was housing people and we know that there is a key worker and other people who wrap around to provide the service that people need so I 'm struggling with three hundred thousand for effectively to full-time community workers which seems an extremely well paid community worker community workers I would much rather that we see it and I 'm very happy that we do everything we can about homeless because at the moment we 're dealing with it through them as well fear fund so so I 'm delighted that we do whatever but I 'm just wondering wouldn 't it be better if we just said well instead of housing 50 which doesn 't actually solve the problem per year we have 75 per year with the and a mat there but not worry about the fact that it 's going into what one full-time a bit more open about it because our aim is to house those people who are homeless but the community relationship thing like to community workers to full-time community workers for what will be effectively people who really have a wraparound service already have the support and then linking them to community organizations there 's 1 to 12 they 1 to 25 I 'm just wondering if there 's another way that we could put the money in achieve a better outcome for the big issue of homelessness that we thought or that we face sure I guess for you miss me you 've got time no no no no no that they 're just laughing because they know I hate met Amir you know so so I thought moves Mir was a sort of a kind of a step up from the answer if I may through me and I think my colleague Jeanne Huey from Sydney has some through the value around them however mannequins be spent in what other value can be added in terms of addressing some other related issues as well my point would be think counselor Buckelew so that in terms of the additional support services that are required to help them which is why we 're promoting here or putting the idea to you of the committee connections can be development work so it 's not just about putting a person on a house there 's all pile of other work related to day in terms of the 50 people through the program that 's what the hazard Parcher secured the funding for through the MSD contract so notwithstanding the additional funding that 's been made and this year 's budget that 's something for the future and it 's not specifically part of this partnership poisel the government has announced that part of the funding in the budget is for the evaluation and monitoring of the program so one imagines that they 'll want to see this in action for the 13 to 12 months before they continue it expand it and you here perhaps you need to answer that questions wealth I just wanted to maybe talk about a way in which we might go to add some extra value to broadly across the other collaborations that the council is involved in at the moment and as a number of counselors have been actively involved in both the housing first the sixth a street worker project and more as more relevantly the inner city street solutions project which is working around primarily people who are being in the inner city now that group has many of the same stakeholders and we 've been taught actively seeking funding from other sources through the people in the partnership who are the city mission not so much the Methodist mission I 'd be more on the periphery although they 've known what 's happening so we we we think there 's a real need before and connect really close connections between housing first and the inner city street solutions our project so as you know some people in the inner city who are beating our homeless in some are but they all have similar issues there has been approach it going on which is no longer funded working with the people who are directly in the streets and the partners to the inner city strong connection with housing first with these community development Lucas so we 're wondering if jewel role could be developed between the workers who could still be based in the housing first model but it could work directly on the inner city street solutions project and it has been some quite weekly discussion around that so maybe that 's a way forward yeah me um thanks um I 'll just a little bit unclear there was an announcement on the 4th of May a hundred million to tackle homelessness and it said that the government had boosted funding for ongoing services for more than nine hundred households in the housing first program in Auckland Prussia Tirana Hamilton right and Lower Hutt and that was twenty point five million the government then goes on I mean there 's a number of quotes around the importance of housing first and it says housing first provides housing with no readiness conditions it also provides wraparound support and services for as long as needed to help people stay in house and improved lives so two questions from that one are we aware of what given that so it was the very first question I asked and it was answered which is sorry clear what the answer was okay the answer well I 'm I heard the advice that we received which was that it was to extend the number of people that were what we 're able to be housed under the program that it wasn 't for then that 's not what this proposals for well they won 't have allocated yet will they it 's evolving so I understand an mes stay staff have been involved in the street feeding project and they 're telling us it 's an evolving situation but they still saying they support development workers working to build capacity with these people and especially won 't being directly involved with people who are begging who aren 't necessarily homeless so it 's an evolving situation so we 're in a meeting with the minister I don 't know what happened there there was there 's a new budget announcement for more money for housing first but we don 't know how many numbers we 're getting and you of the principles of it sure and to is we 've answered before what I mean that the existing contract is 450 people per year so it 's the existing contract that the housing first patch up here have for the government yes and budget 2018 states boost funding for existing services support nine hundred households in the housing first program Auckland Christchurch thought on the Wellington counterpart twenty million cut the Bucks point if we 're gonna agree to this funding today then can we actually go back to government and say it 's great you 've made this announcement we 're happy to contribute on the basis that you provide X amount more spaces given that you 've announced it so that we 've actually got the sort of partnership around extending the numbers that this will go to one of majors that we can make that point in the future of government yes we understand your budget through the funds we would like to see the service further rolled out here fifty Ryo isn 't dealing what with the total number there 's a higher demand so just wanted to UM see if you guys are aware of the job that 's currently advertised on the Christchurch City Council for the marginalized community liaison person for the Christchurch central library the libraries have been involved in industry so the job is it 's a full-time one in the library build relationships marginalized in homeless communities and the organization supporting them here 's a plug for the eighteen people watching YouTube if you want a job that you 've got till the end of the day to apply 50,000 to 60,000 salary which is fantastic but what what is this you know I just I just want to know that there 's not going to be any sort of double up of what we 're actually doing because I mean these homeless people imagine alized I don 't want them to be going over there and over there and over there and feel like they 've been pulled between Arthur and Martha you know they need a single point of entry where they 're actually going to be able to find what they need and then actually get or well as far as that like my conversations taking place with other staff involved in this we wouldn 't be doubling up the library service is about facilitating people the libraries and the programs making sure they 've got programs aligned to people who are in that particular community who would be serviced all their names I think thank you um my questions really is around the scope that Ministry of development will be funding just for clarity and you may have indicated this before but my understanding is that in fact the whole community connectivity part which which the report refers to and I guess that that Community Development part for that for people who are homeless who have virtually no other connections apart from their own group with homeless people that in fact that 's the part that in fact the report is asking for funding for from Council and it 's particularly because it 's not covered by the minister contract with with MST yeah answer the question journey and I 'll go through the check it 's about capacity building and looking after people and people we need to work with people from the bottom up with the people who are homeless and the people who are in the street and the people I 'm just going to just sound people out here because you know we 've got a very full agenda today and a number of other events that we have to attend to so what I would suggest is that we park this this proposal and deal with the rest of the paper if people are quite comfortable with that and we 'll get it through the report back on this item for the next meeting okay so on that basis is somebody prepared to move the the balance of the recommendations Sarah seconded by Mike so I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's carried and we 'll get a report back on that item so now I would like to move that we resolve to exclude the public for all of the reasons set out on the agenda that that the moniker Moroni and Meena nada be invited to remains for remain after the public room yep for items 27 and 28 so and a sick and ends that the resolution and includes the additional items set out on 84 to 88 of the agenda so seconded by Andrew I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's Carrie

22nd of February which asks staff to report on all council and external funding sources and the report was already written that was going to the committee which was there on the 4th of April and it only referenced potential council sources of funding and it referenced an earlier committee resolution and didn 't really preferrence the council resolution at all so here 's a council resolution to look at external sources of funding for this being fulfilled or are we doing this ahead of that work foundation so the council resolution with staff I requested to report to the Committee on all council and external options to help fund the proposed initiatives and then a week later the committee decided on a council one without looking at external ones are we able to look at external before it comes back yes we could do that yeah instruct us to do that yeah I mean that was the council resolution at the 22nd of February sorry oh yeah I 've kind of um I 've seen an email through last night and I braised days while you were away yeah Deon Andrew so Mike yeah so my question is around we 're that we who 's actually getting the money for for their housing the first one in the in the report it says the mission the crust rich meal Methodist mission will land will be the lead contractor in the in the program the mission will be the employer of the community development worker blah blah blah then it just full stop TIF patio door matter has been working in inner-city East for over 20 years to fethiye dog matter so it what I don 't get what Tiffany door mutters doing because it says the missions getting the money don 't want is a partner 's initiative the fund holder for this grant if it 's successful will be the city mission because they will that 's where the workers will be based it just it just reads in here as though that that 's just being copied and pasted and stuck in there and don 't don 't see any other reference to to what they 're specifically doing so I what the missions involvement will be and how to actually who 's actually doing what the mission will be the base in the employer of the manager in the two workers dinner and this so there will be the fund I 'm not sure talk about the other partners that are involved in this I just I just want to know if there Jamie can you shed any light on that if that sentence has just been hopeful properly answering your questions is something missing there super funny and Zonk page 104 for anybody that wants to look at it sorry it 's on page 184 of the report yep certainly and Tiffany just make them being involved in the champions group and part of the wider network of agencies and organizations involved in the housing first project that 's the core for organizations fault or that the lead organizations will be in touch with yeah but I 'm still within this report I 'm just trying to understand it 's all it almost as if like the mission has been has been written dear and then all of a the sentence structures with the mission well instead of the mission they 're not just I 'm just confusing if it 's at the top of page one eight five if you know what I read it you 'll sort of see what I mean I 'm just really confused because it 's not very clear who 's actually running what and what 's actually happening in terms of them I mean if we 're I 've had 300,000 this needs to be very clear sure sure no it 's most evenly through the the mission is the lead organization involved in housing for Spanish upon so I can 't really comment on exactly why the sentence structures like that report I think it 's just to somehow elude or make reference that other organizations involved oh so we 're pretty closely on the street and arrest yeah I mean I 'm just reading it and it says that the lead contractor is the Methodist mission and that they will be the employer of the community development worker and Pearson port worker and provide supervision training and support but if support and guidance for the workers so it seems to me that the way it 's structured us as identify that they 'll be working alongside to study without very clear at all no I agree that the sentence structure is not very good but it 's I think that 's what it means it 's about contextual yeah Andrew it 's across NGOs we 're one of the NGO hot is the fund holder for collaboration across a number of NGOs rather than trying to speed out the money across seek real months a fun talk about all the partners involved in the direction mentioned of the woodcut new she funders and when a partnership like you missed you require one plant holder we often do as well yeah Andrew thank you so the funding that we 're providing and there 's coming from this fund that would provide for the employment of the full-time Community Development worker to part-time peer workers peer working capacity building and so on as detailed on the report presumably that is designed to reflect our role as a partner in this program that yes that 's correct so I mean is the proposal notes it 's it 's working in the whole community development community community connections area to help sustain the tenancies so that 's the the the additional extra value that council can provide in addition to the core housing first proposal I mean simply the events oversee shows the more that you can work with with folks to reinforce develop and sustain those community connections within the neighborhood better off the better chance of success in the long run you have just following on from that if additional funding were able to be sourced from another provider such as rata or some other funder that funding wouldn 't necessarily be applied to this aspect of the program my understanding is the more funding that 's

report really said I guess implied was that council wouldn 't usually apply for funding on behalf of other agencies I 'm just making the a comment and who might be R me out as is accurate I 'll need to defer to Colleen closely associated with yeah I think I think that it 's not an consistent what 's the point though that the series raised which is that that we were to look to external ones and so you 're saying that external sources were looked for but that we couldn 't no I 'm saying that there weren 't no sources of external funding that counsel could could access yes but I don 't know that that was the intention of the resolution on the 22nd of February I think the intention of the resolution of the 22nd of February was in the spirit of the collaboration of their actual housing first thing itself was to look for external sources of funding to support it and partnership with the council so but I 'm getting some advice on that Mike Mike the actual initial request was for I think six hundred thousand over three years but the funding for this fund was available for the two years so I split it over the two years with an option to extend it if that before don 't only use two hundred thousand and if will keep a hundred thousand sort of the holes three hundred thousand been used up in year one I don 't know sorry in does this fund allow therefore for that money to be carried over years and if it does Percy someplace where they can apply to have it rolled forward um my a Vicki um I had a problem that that we has 50 people without this and then at the end of the time of adding another 300,000 per annum we still house 50 people so in terms of the bigger biggest best use of housing first I would have thought it was housing people and we know that there is a key worker and other people who wraparound to provide the service that people need so I 'm struggling with 300,000 for effectively to full-time community workers which seems an extremely well paid community worker community workers I would much rather that we see it and I 'm very happy that we do everything we can about homeless because at the moment we 're dealing 'm delighted that we do whatever but I 'm just wondering wouldn 't it be better if we just said well instead of housing 50 which doesn 't actually solve the problem per year we have 75 per year with the and a Matt there but not worry about the fact that it 's going into one full-time and two part-time community workers could we just be a bit more open about it because our aim is to house those people who are homeless but the community relationship thing like to community workers to full-time community workers for what will be effectively people who really have a wraparound service already have the support and then linking them to community organisations is 1 to 12 they 1 to 25 I 'm just wondering if there 's another way that we could put the money in achieve a better outcome for the big issue of homelessness that we thought or that we face sure well I guess I 'm that 's for you miss me I 've got time miss Mannis chair no no no no no that they 're just laughing so I thought Liz Mir was a sort of a kind of a step up from there to pad answer if I may through me and I think my colleague Jeanne Huey that certainly has some food of value around on how the mannequins be spent in what other prevail you can be added in terms of addressing some other related issues as well my point would be that I 'm housing first is not housing only and I think counselor Buckelew so that in terms of additional support services that are required to help them which is why we 're promoting here or putting the idea to you of the community connections can be development work so it 's not just about putting a person on the house this all pile of other words related to day in terms of the fifty people through the program that 's what the housing patcher secured the funding for through the MSD contract so notwithstanding the additional funding that 's been made and this year 's budget that 's something for the future and it 's not specifically part of this partnership is for the evaluation and monitoring at the program so one imagines that they 'll want to see this in action for the 13 to 12 months before they continue and expand it and for you as the oppressor genie to answer that question is wealth good morning everyone I just wanted to maybe talk about a language we might go to add some extra value to this approach this house in this project by looking more broadly across the other collaborations that the council is involved in at the moment and as a number of counselors have been actively involved in both the housing first the sixth a street worker project and more and more relevantly the inner city street solutions project which is working around primarily people who are begging in the inner city now that group has many of the same stakeholders and we 've been taught actively seeking funding from other sources through the people in the partnership who are the city mission not so much the Methodist mission and I 've been more on the periphery although going on what 's happening so we we connections between housing first and the inner city street solutions our project so as you know some people in the inner city who are beating our homeless in some are honest but they all have similar issues there has been a project going on which is no longer funded working with the people who are directly in the streets and the partners to the inner city solutions project would really like to see a really really strong arm connection with housing first with these community development Lucas so we 're wondering if at Jewel wall could be developed between the workers who could still be based in the housing first model but it could work directly on the inner city street solutions project and it has been some quite weekly discussion around there so maybe that 's a way forward yonni um thanks I 'll just a little bit unclear there was an announcement on the 4th of May a hundred million to tackle homelessness and it said that the government had boosted funding for ongoing services for more than nine hundred households in the housing first program in Auckland twenty point five million the government thing goes on I mean there 's a number of quotes around the importance of housing first and it says housing first provides housing with no readiness conditions it also provides wraparound support and services for as long as needed to help people stay in house and improved lives so two questions from that one are we aware of what the minister 's announcement means in terms of our program given that so that was the very first question I asked and it was answered which is sorry clear what the answer was okay the answer well I bet I heard the advice that we received which was that it was to extend the number of people that were what we 're able to be housed under the program that it wasn 't for then that 's not what this proposals for well they won 't have allocated you will they it 's evolving as I understand it Amyas stay staff has been involved in the street feeding project and they 're telling us it 's an evolving situation but they 're still saying capacity with these people and especially won 't being directly involved with people who are begging who aren 't necessarily homeless so it 's an evolving situation so we had a meeting with the minister I don 't know what happened there there was there 's a new budget announcement for more money for housing first but we don 't know how many numbers we 're getting and you were being asked to make a significant contribution to one of the principles of it sure and to is we 've answered before I mean that the existing contract is 450 people per year so it 's the existing contract that the housing first partial here have for the government yes and budget 2018 states boost funding for existing services support more than 900 households in the housing first program Auckland Christchurch thought on a Wellington apart so the allocation 20 million cuts the box point if we 're gonna agree to this funding today then can we actually go back to government and say it 's great you 've made this a nice phone we 're happy to contribute on that you 've announced it so that we 've actually got a sort of partnership around extending the numbers that this will go to one of majors that we can make that point and in the future of government yes we understand your budget through the funds we would like to see the service through the rolled out here 50 Ryo isn 't dealing what with the total number there 's a higher demand so these we of course we can continue at Dion I just wanted to see if you guys are aware of the job that 's currently advertised on the Christchurch City Council for the marginalized community liaison person for the Cross central library so the job is it 's a full-time one in the library build relationships marginalized in homeless communities and the organizations supporting them here 's a plug for the 18 people watching YouTube if you want a job did you 've got till the end of the day to apply 50,000 to 60,000 salary which is fantastic but what what is this you know I just I just want to know that there what we 're actually doing because I mean these homeless people imagine alized I don 't want them to be going over there and over there and over there and feel like they 've been pulled between Arthur and Martha you know they need a single point of entry where they 're actually going to be able to find what they need and then actually get the support they need well thank you my questions really is around the scope the Ministry of development will be funding just for clarity and you may have indicated this before but my understanding is that in fact the whole community connectivity part which which the report refers to and I guess that that Community Development part for that for people who are homeless who have virtually no other connections apart from their own group with homeless people that in fact that 's the part that in fact the report is asking for funding for from Council and it 's particularly because it 's not covered by the minister contract with with MST yeah answer the question Jenny and I 'll go through the people and assisting them to make connections the exactly same word that people we need to work with people from the bottom up with the people who are homeless and the people who are in the street and I 'm just going to just sound people out here because you know we 've got a very full agenda today and a number of other events that we have to attend to so what I would suggest is that we park this this proposal and deal with the rest of the paper if people are quite comfortable with that and we 'll get a further report back on this item for the next meeting okay so on that basis is somebody prepared to move the the balance of the recommendations Sarah seconded by Mike so I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and we 'll get a report back on that item so _"

    "text": "right now we 'll turn back to something that doesn 't quite go so smoothly and we are up to the debate now who wants to debate this it was glean Yanni and Dion but you don 't need to come back to the table if you don 't want to because we 're up to the debate the odd staff has tried to participate from time to time but I assure you you won 't want to infill all right clean Thank You me just a few notes here just over this obviously looking forward to the draft but just a wee story when the Preston 's development was included the two been outside the red line so it was included after the quakes after you know considerable housing unit loss it was touted in many quarters as being affordable and obviously prices in there will vary friends of ours paid 750 all up for land and housing so tell me how that 's affordable in my view we need intervention by way of tools if this is about land use while I do support obviously the note over which would or could be inclusionary zoning which takes in social housing obviously it takes an affordable housing social housing is a subset of that we need to do this we know from one of the advisors at least to the Housing Minister Shem you bill a cubed that New Zealand flatlined with its social housing building in 1991 and that flatlined in house construction total which would have resulted in a squeeze in terms of supply thereby forcing prices up over time so we need to look ahead as vicki has said we have a big baby boomer bubble coming through and we 're going to be caught out if we want Christchurch and Canterbury to be an attractive place to live work and play sometimes you have to do the boring stuff like housing and we need to ensure that housing will be affordable for for people to come here and settle so I I really hope that when we do get that draft we get a really good go this is a real opportunity to make some change but we can 't just talk about social housing otherwise you 're just hoping and it 's an arbitrary thing unless you impose some kind of at all in my view it 's not going to happen so I 'm looking forward to their opportunity when it comes our way thank you yeah II wanted to speak in support of council looming stone he may not be aware that in 2007 the Greater Christchurch Urban development 's trilogy had a top 20 priority actions action number 15 carry out the study of housing affordability options around inclusive zoning increasing the stock of social housing partnerships with developers and monitoring the supply and demand of affordable housing at local and regional levels so this stuff is not new this has been around for a number of years now but what we seem to keep doing is using this process to try and deal with bigger issues around housing which seems to be just the idea that we just free up more land more of our vs. tov soils more of our green fields for urban sprawl while at the same time not giving the development around policies in place to across our region so what we 're seeing is a whole desire free up land for as my council colleague is said for quite expensive housing choices for some but not for many and probably we don 't know but I would guess that we 've enabled fewer people that I more houses rather than enabling more people to own a house so we 've basically continued to I think through these strategies enable that rise of inequality and inequity in our society because it always seems that these business principles of bring up more land for development as good and what we see is that the social cost of that is borne by those who can least afford it so I 'm really concerned about this process I personally think a reflection on previous urban development strategy has been that it didn 't respond to what the community wanted because of the governance Arrangements the decision that were being asked to make today continues to enshrine those governance arrangements into a group that I doesn 't I don 't think gives us a good outcome for our city what spent on motorways connecting you know so in my mac to our city enabling more development to happen on our very precious soils where actually we 've got huge issues in terms of the loss of those versatile soils and huge issues in terms of traffic coming into our central city like Cranford street where we 're spending millions and millions of dollars completely contrary to what 's happening in our inner city so I can 't support this I would have really preferred to have a workshop on it I don 't believe that this governance structure gets the best outcome for everyone and as such I think it 's ludicrous that we 're spending time and resource on a document that seems to have more benefit for someone and waimate than ourselves deal I just wanted to speak briefly on wire with wire won 't_''_362.55 be voting for support to support this as well mainly it 's around I just do not think that this is actually necessary for us to do right now I think we 've just done a lot done the district plan that we of other issues that we need to deal with in the city and I just do not see from reading it that this is a priority for the City Council at the moment and that 's just why I won 't be voting for it so counts as I will be supporting it I think as we we know that under commander air current law in fact as a council we required to work collaboratively with the other territory authorities and we should do that future development strategy it 's part of what we have to do and I think we 've got an opportunity to do it well that this is really just asked asking for the initial scoping paper to be done around the extent of land and Christchurch which will be required for housing and like as we know besides they 're coming back to our Council for ratification the scoping paper the whole thing will go out for consultation so we have it is actually surrounded by a democratic process which is quite different to some of the the recent legislation we had for example around required to do the land-use pinning the way the way developed and I can understand the concerns around urban sprawl and what and what has happened and in the taking up of green space as against the intensification of as a greater Christchurch which in fact the the herb the urban development strategy was designed to do but I think we need to really work with this process and as Pauline has indicated it clearly needs to fit alongside the transport plan for growth across Greater Christchurch as well and that that we have to make sure that that in fact that doesn 't remain a sticking point we know for example that most of the most of the people who are employed in Greater Christchurch come in to Christchurch City for their employment we have to make sure that in fact that transport planning works well alongside where air future housing will be syrup thank you it 's just really good to remember with us it is paper it is designed in a way where we got changes to make sure that the the draft comes back to council through the UDS process we know that people understand that we can 't have unlimited growth on to our versatile soils my feeling is that this will come back simply affirming the position that we already have and our partner councils and Selman and Waimakariri do understand the big picture although they have their own local challenges and they are aware that they will need our by and to get through any changes that they want it will come back we will workshop it it is a legislative requirement we have to do it we need some changes to the feasibility test because I think it 's got about a 20 percent development profit sort of thing here at the moment which a lot of developers in they 're not looking at that in different ways of doing developments organizations like know who and things aren 't taken into account through this this process at all we legally need to do this we need to make the best of it and so let 's just get on with that a breath just a very quick statement look I mean this this city has as many cities in New Zealand also have is how to build houses that is the problem and I think that 's what people should be focusing their energy on right thank you I 'll put the motion then all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried so who oppose Yanni Aaron and deal thank you _"

    "text": "I just know that these are is a constraint in terms of some time right good afternoon now this has been through the innovation and sustainable development committee so I invite the chair of the committee to introduce the report so this has gone through a workshop and then to the committee and this is the result of what Scott and the whole thing was redrafted and I have to say it 's been redrafted I think extremely well by Christine 's ed and it 's it 's what we 've now arrived at is something that captures not just the logistics of of the Antarctic strategy in terms of the the economic impact that in tactical has on Christchurch but tried to capture some of the sort of the magic of the history of in tactic expiration in terms of the impact that it has on Christchurch people and if you look through everything in Christchurch there are so many aspects of Antarctica that are here and it 's almost in our DNA I mean it 's one of the was originally part of onto an island of course we 've covered the environmental the sustainability but also all of the practical issues of being a gateway city and some of the excitement that goes with that and tried to share some of that excitement with the people of Christchurch so this is a continent of course that 's got no government which is pretty excited exciting and itself it 's had no Wars it 's it 's an amazing place if you 've ever been near there the feeling as you fly back into Christchurch of the explosion of color having looked at white for a week is totally amazing and just incredible but Christchurch is one of the very few places where people can actually get there so the University of Canterbury for example do those amazing courses that enable people to go to in tactical just incredible and so what has been tried to be put together and I think quite very well here is the succinct sort of development of all of the aspects of Antarctica inherit feeds and to the economy the environment the sustainability the excitement the magic and the possibility that exists tried to do I think they 've done a very good job and it 's been through the committee and I think we 've arrived at something that 's cool has anyone got any questions first out yep of Christchurch in seat no no no it would be shame so you 'd like to second us so it 's been moved and seconded moot by folkies seconded by Tim yani Jimmy 's just one of what happens and years two and three and if there 's any reporting that dates for any of the actions that are in here to to Council so I 'm not quite clear how it reports back on a regular basis and um just for the sake I 'll just add the second question which is related as are we able to get the international relations working party having like a six monthly update or or reporting so that you know endorse what 's in here but I just want to understand how they govern say well as counselors wider international working relationship if I can systems of reference for Vicky 's Committee execs only committee came at least you counsel wished you know maybe could be doing me done but yeah and then the second thing was so in terms of like individual plans that get developed will they come back to Council or they 'll just set with crusher Shunzhi so they don 't come back to council if they head to that obviously be shared with stakeholders which obviously includes the council generally individual implementation plans would only come up to the food Council if if that amount of delegation or decision we do have the intention to incorporate aspects of strategy and a statement in to depend on a certain today and the first question was the years two and three if you go to your action plan it kind of fits great it 's got you want outcomes then it skips the year for a lot of detail on you well a lot of that detail is about developing plans into the future we wanted to reflect a clear indication of momentum and to that ten-year horizon but those plans of year one for example looking at the opportunities around will inform a detailed plan for years towards room and then term would be reflected back into the annual statement of intent the records are chemi Thank You Me At to patients first time we got into the page 30 the pair was sixth on the eighth I just want to know who are those that his strategy partners and stakeholders coalition accepted lost early agencies particular Hydra viewlet Exodus 33 Sula our priority one to party for their culture NZ CIA here this written for uni has some other agency also should be getting involved in Easter in tactical strategy so you 're asking Jimmy I think around who attended especially the paragraph six point eight refers to the workshop that was run by Costas indeed with 22 participants so you 'd like to know who those agencies with yes yeah so they have broad support and their kitchens in the in the strategy so in the back page of the strategy document itself refers to the stakeholders engaged with during the process if you like we could pick out their list now the numerous doing numerous stakeholders organizations on page 40 and 41 yet over cheerful yeah second question I follow the transfer you need your hands equation because this Antarctica kinda often regional should be the part of the white church international relationship connection and also a moment in Council we did have the international relations working group we have the cancerous we have eight key strategic partnership representatives so we provide a strategical oversight in the advice so my questions why these the entitled charity not a presenter Lisa walking cool to give the the strategical otherwise this migration so the terms of reference for the and sustainable development committee include the Antarctic related work so that 's what came through that committee I imagine going forward knowing that we 're looking to come up with a new international relations strategy in association with your working group and up to Council that anything Antarctic related would would be captured within there and obviously worked with Christ 's teachings even Becky 's committee can I just suggest Joe are you okay if we have a thing that suggests that you report back every six months to the that the members of no problem can be really useful dialogue just so I fully understand the purpose of the workshop would be to review levels of service just enough time and I think it 's more direct yeah so we could add that or we 'll just do that a moment in cultured City Council we did have existing international relations of policy but if we reveal this policy or establish in pou palace for the near future we are proceeding but exist in the international relation the palace still only lost fear to be the function this might be great yeah Sira um just quickly because the sort of a lot of the Civic international function will still sit within the City Council because of you know the status on the any meetings operationally how that works when you look at 5.19 with the budget do you need the entire because some of it function is still sitting within council does all of the office budget had to go to christchurch in seattle could some of its stay with the council for those functions so it 's officially gene lead the strategy has been drafted with the view that the lead agency would be Christ easy to capture all of the synergies the budget that we referred to in paragraph five point nineteen as the Antarctic office related budget which is is not every budget would like to be bigger so yes it is absolutely in teaching that Cermak international relations team in particular but all of Council work with Christ 's teachings Eve and M committing us so that synergies of our other operations in particularly Christine teeth would be used to the max in the civic and international relations team and their association with Emir in particular is a key part of that collaboration does that answer your question yeah yes although that was going to cost us stall the staff time and money and those are there involved anyway so so we if they 're not currently coming out of it coming out of normal counselor operations so that the involvement of us quite often events at co-hosted or involvement of things so there 's perfect active part other so therefore the costs are borne in the entire office if you like and a silicon international relations and penny on you 've in Rimini visits which include I just wonder whether it would be useful to actually and include a reference to the sand the second resolution so approved the responsibility for Antarctic office being transferred to christchurch NC together with accompanying funding effective at 1 July 2018 noting and this is taking it from the paper that that working closely with the council particularly the mayor 's office and the Civic own international relations team will be an important part of the ongoing relationship you can I did cover those at the committee as well but we 're in a much more public public forum here and the last time we passed a strategy that we enter questions it was the event strategy and that sort of receipt as it was and then within a couple of months you know you came back and said well this is all good but if you want us to do it properly we need more money is that going to happen here so we 've developed a the fiscal envelope developed with and the LTP thank you very much do we need to have a a reporting format included in the resolution because I mean often reporting doesn 't necessarily occur in this there 's a trigger for it so I just wonder if we if we have requests christchurch you can see to report on a six monthly basis we 're really comfortable to the innovation and sustainability committee who will invite the international relations we can group to be part of that workshop yeah is everyone happy okay now it 's been moved by Councillor bucks seconded by Councillor Scandrick is there any debate I will put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed oppose they know that is carried unanimously thank you well done good work _"

    "text": "now we 'll go back to the number eight number eight okay now um stuff do you want to just make a quick overview of the why why are we doing this and just a just a brief synopsis of the opera ' history and how we 've got to this this point in time and then I know councillors have got some questions for you okay so that this scope this is in response to resolution by the great question partnership there 's a great time to take this process in this manner is addressing the requirements of the national policy statement there 's requires us to develop a future development strategy in bits because we are one of the one of the partners of the great across and one of the high growth here the high growth area so this is a legal requirement and uncertainty yep thank you in terms of the history as familiar that we 've had a future development strategies because their development strategy in 2016 there was an update provided to that strategy to sort of bring it into today 's environment but the land use aspects and so it was recognized we needed to do that and this being done in conjunction with the obligation that we have to do it coming out of the national policy statement there 's also updating our population projections that happens every few years and so this will also be a direct response to of those and some suppose new detailed aspects that we have to come up through addressing any shortfalls and Pavelec capacity is looking not just at location which the Utes and their district plans tend to look at but also looking at Metis such as typology x '_''_127.44 and enterprise point so meeting the demand for particular price points in particular type apologies which we haven 't and the past had to go down to that detail so that 's quite important when you consider the huge demand for affordable housing into the future right okay so questions okay so given that it need to address the demand for affordable housing and the huge increase that there will be in the demand for social housing given the lack of ownership and given dramatically and there is a huge wave of people who will come to age 65 and not own a house and who will need social housing can this also address given that it 's mostly about so when I 'm WiMAX since our district scheme is done can it also address the need for the social infrastructure and so and so when and why mech so that those demands don 't all fall on just the city as they currently do the Greater Christchurch area the future development strategy so to be clear it does cover christchurch city and it does cover the required demand for affordable housing including social housing so that 's a component of it and yes it does include the demand that can be met and so how Selwyn and why Matt can come true as well meeting that tomorrow it 's us across if we said well that must cover this beyond so stupid mr. great Christchurch partnership in theory I think what there 's there 's some confusion that the proposed changes to the original policy statement almost you might consider it as an look at the site 's l1 and why make medium to him shortfall that 's what that is about so there is a proposal to consider or to undertake a section 32 analysis to look at a proposed change to the wreck Canterbury regional policy statement but that 's actually a secret mission yes I 've tried to explain in a very short paragraph that there are two tracks and it 's a separate process and actually we 've probably got a greater issue that we need to address in terms of the regional policy statement change and ensuring that it is focused on the length of term that it 's intended to be focused on and not ending up and the long term really yeah just to be very clear at the moment the demand for social infrastructure force on the city so when my met do not meet the any of the demand or a minor tiny amount of the demand so what I just want to be very clear on is that you 've talked about affordable housing which is great for those who can afford to they will have the ability to remain in their community when they need social housing and that it will be provided and that if we have the capacity in this to push for it that it is included specifically so just to be very clear yes so as part of that said another one of the outcomes we the city would be expecting that it 's my met through their proposed change to the Canterbury regional policy statement looking at the medium term that they provide that they provide for the range of housing typology such that would provide for more affordable housing and so that comes down to density affordable inverse rental event social housing now the kind of regional policy statement is not the mechanism to it depends how far you expect the Canterbury region a policy statement to go in terms of dealing directly to social housing and if the cantilever mean to do it 's it 's a LAN juice document it is only in juice so Len juice and yeah I mean it 's more about density than it has about you know with who or whether it 's as for social housing is a mechanism to address various apologies 30 persistent but this is a future development strategy we know the issue we know that all of the Selwyn and Womack issues come into the city at the moment what I 'm trying to ensure is that affordable for many people looking forward will be social housing sorry to say that but that is the reality so does it actually and can it specifically include that so I 'm sorry to assist with it but so the future too can be so it 's a direct response to the national policy statement that urban development capacity within that it is up to the grated cottage partnership how far it wishes to go into providing maybe actions or implementation as part of that that would address will look to begin to address the matter of professional yes so can we do we need to add to the recommendations such that when it goes back to the committee greater Christchurch partnership that it specifically addressed was the part of the feedback that would go into the could we have a noting recommendation noting another noting which says that notes that the the city would have an expectation that social housing will be will be a component of of of all three of the solutions of the three of the two districts as well as the city yep yep proponent of the two districts what the two districts yeah I know but the two districts are more yes oh no but but you trying to say we provide for the greater Christchurch area there are two districts that that are border Christchurch City here christchurch the city will have any expectation that will be a component of the two districts as well as crashes city okay Jonnie thank you so when we previously discuss this I thought we agreed to approach the minister all the ministers from the previous government when this came in around why we were being asked to do it given that we 've done a land-use recovery plan and we 've done a district plan with you can with Donna new ds3 Fraser update we did we did we actually the greater Christchurch we not meet these timeframes but I have to say that that the the there is no time left not to proceed so just so I 'm clear so that was the previous go on all my current one so the government still wants us to do this there 's been no change the timelines from the car yeah and have we got a process to to actually logically go back to them and say we 're concerned we 've just had all this work done in this area and we 're just having to do okay well it 's not a duplication because it is actually I mean as I say there 's a there 's a link to the other stream of work but it is a requirement to do it we 're in the high growth category and the high growth category is as significantly driven off Waimakariri and so and not christchurch no no no no we 're contributing start plan and the changes to the regional policy statement only dealt with growth to 2028 mmm we have to deal with worth to 2048 also to at the land use or the development capacity requirements to 2048 to support any joint position or land use in transport and a lot of that works already been done through the UTS you know and I think government have recognized that if the works been done then the job becomes that much smaller so we cover cloth accordingly but what we do is we ensure that the strategy brings through that wealth of work that 's been done to show we don 't need to do too much more so I 'm just trying to understand like the possible outcome of this doing it through greater Christchurch partnership does it have to be done through the Greater Christchurch partnership or could we just do this as a City Council it absolutely has to be at a greater Christchurch level because it has regional significance the the impact of growth and so on and why make end in providing for just what you mentioned before the huge challenge of affordable housing if it 's a greater crisis I 'm just trying to set with a legal requirement or whether it as a city we can but strongly strongly recommends we especially when we 've got an established udes which is looking at addresses the Greater criteria but it strongly advises that councils we 're there particularly is cross over boundary issues that they work together to address the urban growth issues in the impede but can I just say this is the scoping paper this is not the draft that 's going out for public consultation and getting at the problem you know and you know it was it was made very clear you know and I 'm you know acknowledge Sarah Templeton as the one of the representatives on the Greater Christchurch partnership absolutely crystal clear that it was to come back to us so the original staff recommendation that went to the urban devour Greater Christchurch partnership was that this council delegate the decision-making to the greater Christchurch partnership we 've said no and a case was made and that was accepted and so that draft will come back and what I 'm giving an undertaking to today is that we will root shop the draft in detail is the scoping paper but this is the start of this process and I believe once we agree to this and ratify it then it 's very hard to change some key elements of it now for some of us who have had history with the UTS and what we saw was the community wanted us not to go and spread out into the green fields that was overwhelming from the public submissions but because of the decision-making process on it it basically didn 't that wasn 't the outcome of what the outcome was was urban sprawl at the expense of more dense population in the in the central city and in the inner city and what we had as a result this huge motorway is being built and what we 've seen since ETS has come in a lack of focus on affordable and social housing there were actions around that in the in the UTS and they were never really given much effect oh it was about providing infrastructure to the turbines to support urban sprawl which led to the motorways being built and so what I is really if are we confident that the decision-making around us is going to give lead to the best outcomes for the city as opposed to neighboring territorial authorities who seem to have everything to gain from this and we seem to have the most to lose can I just say that it 's that there 's a parallel process that that we need to be briefed on and we need to work through a number of those issues this is not the forum this is not the place for that but you know I mean I I can 't persuade you around the council table and I think we just need to move on and accept that there 's no time for a workshop on this before we ratify it it 's the scoping I promise that there will be a workshop before we consider the drought and the second question was around the housing targets that are mentioned in this report have they been seized or when do they get and they again here to compare to council is there a kind of in this process over you parallel work components how we got a kind of understanding of the process for what agreeing certain things sorry how do you mean well like things like the minimum housing targets for example right it 's just not clear from from a from reading to us around how we actually make decisions around things like the minimum housing targets whether that 's the hearings panel that gets to do it no out of the woodshop out of the process and as part of the technical work that the staff are doing sorry I 'm trying to understand who makes the decisions well finally they come back oh they come yes so the future developers are here but you can 't swim in it we 'll hit with them at the minimum targets it 's to be fear it 's not actually clear which goes the minimum targets have to be put onto the Canterbury regional policy statement by December this year ideally the future development strategy gets signed off and the company 's part of that the minimum targets a settlement and then so that 's decided by each authority clean thank you thank you Sarah great to see the drill down to price points and typology and I 'm just wondering with what sits behind this discussion is it a principle which we pick up and Christchurch 's sorry crush it city 's own housing policy that being inclusionary zoning so obviously you know explicitly affordable housing development is provided for of which social housing itself as a subset so what would be if this is the scoping and it 's about land use is this the place to begin that conversation was that further on with the the actual workshop and Raj yes I think we need to do a workshop bringing options forward to you about also what document is best to take on what yeah what aspect of it some of it might be in the students future development strategy might be signaling for the work to be required it can 't solve everything but it certainly can sit out maybe a program of work or some initiatives by which to solve the problem or we look towards solving the problem and so I think that well being done to date what more needs to be done and what other options are there to take with it yeah if we had a discussion over eg 25% would be you know affordable and in our land use that yeah okay great do we need to note that today Mir or as well do you think sorry what was that just noting inclusionary zoning as a part of that conversation over social has Dionne thank you in the in the document is a little part around the the integration of other processes and it 's Central City and even auto cut well the Haven River corridor quite interesting to note that actually it says that the regeneration plan is likely to be released for consultation and August which is nice to know um I suppose it was it 's nice to find out in these reports but the thing I 'm worried about is does this type of thing overall supersede the work that 's actually already going to be done so let 's say there 's two years of work that that 's been going on for want any buildings to be built in there and then all of a sudden you get this thing going over top and so actually we think we need some growth in these areas and we 're going to sort of test the boundaries or something so just a clarification the there 's a public exhibition that begins this Saturday on no time within that there is theory at the extent of the work that 's been undertaken part of that is saying the fact that there 's very limited opportunity for residential development so really the outcome of that work is to say that whilst we can expect you know these opportunities to do some innovative new housing it won 't be of the scale that would probably put any a drop in the bucket of what to meet this demand that actually is required so this is just saying they 're not aligned to those other things yeah but what I 'm saying here is that we 're doing you know there 's an agency out there doing this this work over here in the regeneration strategy this is people who are doing this don 't agree with that strategy they can actually say something over top and actually sort of you know start developing with the team only on the attacker or even River so I 'm fully aware of what opportunities were available in that land and that has that 's actually part we actually work quite closely it 's not this one I suppose the future development strategy is looking for opportunities of where to house people that 's that 's one of the fundamental you know outcomes that seekers do so and what it looks to us to say well in that corridor is there any opportunity and the outcome of their work that 's been undertaken it 's not-it 's quite limited but it may present some as I see it some of those ideas for maybe a fort more affordable housing but it was not going to be at the scale when you look at the numbers again it will come back to a workshop on this but when you look at the numbers that we have to try and provide for it 's the challenge ahead that a future development strategy has to tackle Paul in sorry thank you my questions around transport and it 's also about integration so that we know that if we then it stated here that the strategic transport direction of city having these documents will provide an important contribution to these your statement however we know that in the GPS transponders been prioritized over land use in other words then do should occur around existing transport routes and for efficiencies in functionality so is that I mean it 's a chicken Milanese it 's not a particularly think that routing actually supports the priority of transport yeah yes I mean if that the part of the if you go back to the UTS strategic directions that 's that 's quite clearly stated that transport and land use have to be integrated that 's actually one of that 's part of the fisherman it 's part of the strategic goals it 's part of everybody 's strategic priorities and someone might make any ethnicity so beyond so use the same team that is working on the GPS yeah and so yes we having those very conversations within the team within our team structures that are developing this which one derives which and this certainly here 's looking as paddle again when I come back to what is the one of the salt outcomes of this is where do we house people where do we have people in the best location to support those public transport corridors and so forth so that that is actually at one of the key principles of developing that if DSP is very fun to Sarah thank you thank you just two quick things basically if the the later the last greta christchurch partnership meeting we asked again about the the the feasibility tests in the timeframes and whether we had formally written to get those potentially changed so the feasibility tests on how feasible the assessments see how feasible the developers and the timeframes be done there it we 've delayed right into the minister because we 've had some fruit discussions with officials until now we hadn 't so we wanted to the letter to be crafted in a way that we can report those separately in terms of what those positive discussions have led to a bit the next committee meeting but we think that there 's now a much better understanding between government and local government about what 's the pragmatic way of dealing with these issues to deal with yeah and the other one just quickly and would we feel to say they 're taking with a question at the beginning but it 'd be fair to say hey they the fact that all of the council 's need to ratify this at the very end of the process means that both Selwyn and Waimakariri need to also make sure that they do things in a way that will get our sign-off yes yeah very much Aaron yeah so mine 's just there 's just a double-barreled question and most of our reports we often have the financial implication so know how much it 's costing us doesn 't really say in here and so my questions around what is the cost of all of this and then what 's the measurable outcomes at the end so predominantly the staffing consultants picks up all the bail for the consultants because I notice in the the breakdown our if there is a 3.5 but others are just putting in point three with the exception of the Keene or just one so because this projects been dealt with collaboratively the budget that councils contribute to the partnership itself and the running the partnership will pay for the the costs associated with this project it 's primarily to write a document there has been some evidence-based work that 's occurred already but what you 've got in front view is is minimum cost its implications are huge but then they 're picked up through district plans and LTPS and that 's where you 're making the actual decisions on those costings okay oh sorry just one more question it 's not on housing and but it is um the fact that this goes through to 2048 by which time New Zealand and the Christchurch City have to be just about carbon neutral so how to and if you look at the latest Productivity Commission report there is a massive impact on that apart from coastal hazards factored into this I mean it 's one of the issues that 's raised and I suppose because this is fundamentally a land use and transport director document there are its whilst again it may refer to future programs of work or initiatives being there as focuses on land use and transport that would be where we 'd have to see some initiatives that are going towards carbon neutrality again that 's one of the strategic goals priorities I can 't remember directions of the UDS currently and the you know we expect that that it 's going to be carried through and therefore it will have to show an action plan towards this is this is the framework so can we add a note that that there is an expectation that the current strategic framework of the Utes including its focus on climate change as is carried through into the future development strategy it 's okay item thank you just on social housing you speak with regards to cell one and why make that going through the LTP as we are we know what because if this is a future document and we are a partnership no we take pride in our social housing we have issues and at the moment all I consider if they have none and they have none in their LTP there 's a ten-year document with with implications further on so do we know if they or can we look at that to see if what how long they 're going to be and how much they 're going to put in again if we 're an expectation now that we address that as part of the FTEs then we can we 'll ask be asking that of them I had raised that this issue with the minister about the lack of connection between the timeframes so we do an L deep LTP yeah and then we go into a regional transport plan and go into a public transport plan after the LTP in this process is another one after the LTP so I think that we wouldn 't have an expectation that that outcomes in relation to process in the that they 're going through a district plan that would carry on for quite some time it would be disappointing to see our partners and thus not having any vision over social housing because right but it hasn 't been raised with them but they but he 's good hasn 't been raised with them you know what I 'm saying is that we can 't look to the LTP what we can do is we can say that crush it city has an expectation that social housing will be a component of the two districts as well as crush it city we can talk that through with them and we can look at the about the LTP proposal to see and if there is nothing in there with regards to social house and we could ask them timing supervision I mean it 's the wrong way you know that 's what I keep saying they 're doing their LTP now yeah you know but I 'm saying if there is no forward version of them doing in responsible for social housing then we can ask in what their vision was so we have a better understanding of definitely the stuff that 's what we want to do seems to be falling off the wagon so to speak but it hasn 't been raised with them that 's what I 'm saying is you 're gonna need it 's important and with saying it 's so important Center prices yeah Jonnie just obviously housing issues come up quite a lot my understanding is that this supposed to go to crush each housing policy is that in place or will that be in place to inform this targets these targets and so is a priority action in the update it hasn 't been progressed as yet we 've kind of been focused on some of this immediate work there 's got statutory deadlines but it 's still a desire as expressed in their 2016 update and I think this the council 's housing policy forms a good platform to picking up on the point late you know obviously housing isn 't in be have got some interest in housing provision now as well we 've got an action to do something to govern a greater Christchurch housing policy it at targets without doing that policy could it be done as part of this so that we had that kind of common understanding across government and across the region as we were supposed to have done in the greater crush it update last from my side as Sarah said given that this has got a land use transport focus I think there 'll be elements that we can pick up in in that but then there 'll be other elements that are in the housing policy at a Christchurch level that works it easily in in the document would we 're in front of us but could be signaled as actions and programs of work to take forward it 's kind of that 's the way is it best press progress he 's saying I think that falls out of this document yes you 've heard the concerns like for some of us you know it 's going back to the start of the EDS so she want affordable housing always this seems to be the last cab off the rank we 're never seems to regress on that and developed we had an earthquake since then there have been changes made to it through the land use recovery plan and it had to be adapted as a result of those changes that were made not all of those changes were acceptable to the council but they were changes that were made under a framework that we had nothing to do with we have a statutory deadline to meet with this this is the scoping document can we please leave these bigger questions to when we actually address the draft that 's going to go out for public consultation if it ever does excellent review thank you sorry moved move by Sarah Sikandar by film is there any discussion I 'll pop them up okay we 're gonna have to move on to another item on the agenda because we 've got such a short time frame further if we 're gonna all debaters again after questions then can we I know that I 've million I 'm have moved and Sikandar but can we show you another ailee 's yes no another I just want to deal with the just until I order lean because clearly we go and have a workshop on this it made I don 't feel when you compelled to debate it today yeah but it did it doesn 't matter people are entitled to debate it so I 'm sorry team Kate can you hang around and can I invite the team together forward for the Antarctic strategy paper and we 'll move on Tibet _"

    "text": "okay so then moving to item 10 so I 'll bypass item 8 we 'll deal that when we deal with that when the mayor arrives so moving to item 10 the draft submission of the Christchurch City Council on the local government community well-being amendment bill item 10 on page 65 are there any questions for staff on this we 've invited any questions to be provided or any changes to be provided prior to the meeting and nothing was received so we have a resolution to approve the draft submission which I 'm happy to move do I have a second and Mike Davidson is there any debate on this Glen and fell Glen thank you very pleased to see the scope through at the time the full well-beings were removed from the LGA I think the entire local government sector opposed it they weren 't heard and for me the step today takes us a step forward in terms of central government listening to local we 've really come through quite in my view a shameful period over the treatment of local democracy this is if open instance but one where a minister stack up a lot of district plans behind him having a go at all the councils over land provision and housing and that did not go down well with local councils I also note that we considered this paper today and the context of the news of elections coming back for eekend which which is great to see he can was can as you know back in 2010 and so it 's been quite some time since we 've had democracy for our regional councils so I 'm thrilled that is going through I have heard it mentioned in one quarter that we explore the possibility of some kind of covenant or treaty between central and local government so that a great deal more respect is actually built into the the kind of framework between central and local I 've never seen so many attacks local government is I have and the last nine years so I 'm thrilled that this is going through today the for well beings and the DC dimension that goes with it as well enabling us to charge for 'll all valent payment Thank You Phil Thank You look I certainly endorse what clean has seen about supporting the staff but the staff have written I think it 's it 's a very good submission I certainly recall and most of you will when the fall well beings were taken out by a previous government was like a real assault on local government in terms of our well being and I 'm very pleased that the these this new bill will restore those well beings yeah in like an example to of where I think local government have missed out and have have had to pay a lot more was because that was a the narrowing of development contributions and how they might be able to be collected by our councils and so that in effect I think did do great harm in terms of adding to the costs of every council throughout New Zealand so I think Ian and the staff for this preparing a submission and I 'm very happy to support it thank you also it can counselors across the room I think it 's really when they were taken out in 2012 by the then national government it was aimed at trying to reign under this so-called overspend in by local governments to try and actually fill a lot of the need within community but I think what it really does show I guess is actually councils the funding we get through rates and other mechanisms is just not enough to provide what we need to provide to actually put in quality infrastructure and also support communities appropriately or properly so this is actually a really good step but it needs to go further in terms of actually the money we get the funding we get the revenue we get and how we therefore can distribute it properly across our communities and to our city to make sure that we meet all the needs yeah I largely agree with the reinstatement of the well bangs I just wanted to draw council 's attention to the changes to the development contributions and that is the reinstatement of the of a wider definition which i think is as well needed we lost out as a city particularly after the earthquake meaning that we actually lost out on millions of dollars going towards providing from the growth to set each other to the needs that we had to provide the infrastructure so really welcome that we just had a deputation the other day from the people and welcome and you know to think that a brand new development with many many houses goes in and tints of housing goes into that community without any ability to for that developer to pay and contribute to the plot the local playground being upgraded seems to me absolutely unfair and and you know that development contribution may have been going to other things out and halls well or for the north of the city but it doesn 't go back into that local community that 's bearing the impact of that development so you know I welcome the changes to the development contributions definition and also the other thing that we 're asking for in our submission which is again long overdue has been to have a much clearer infringement regime for councils rather than this ridiculous thing when we try go through a very complicated expensive prosecution like through the courts rather than have the ability to give out infringement and so you know I think the benefit of those twofold one it would enable us to have bylaws that we could enforce a lot easier a lot more cost-effective but also it doesn 't criminalize people for breaching our Bibles as well so you know I think there 's a real advantage to to having their infringement regime refined and I think it would be a lot a lot better for us in terms of how we how we run the city so I welcome the staff submission we support it today very good there anyone else we 're good I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried thank you _"

Charles sick so I beard in the hospital to come and make a submission plan you have our undivided attention right look I 'm the owner of people 's group who 've invested heavily into the CBD of Christchurch and we 've got three major projects underway at the moment at the farmers market in town we 've also got the death we Center beside Valentine 's which is 16 retail shops and also those store at Duncan 's buildings in High Street this is our biggest year yet and you might ask why I invested heavily I do quite often ask that question but you know I always sold the dream you know that the dream of that you know that beautiful video they played with the you know the Convention Center and in the city housing and the walkways and the sovereign lanes Edie you know in Derby Fiat you taking a bit longer than come to fruition but it is happening but the major major major project and I think the project that was most important and all the profits is the multi-purpose arena has taken me about the yearly to say that round stadium good evening I 've got it now so multi-purpose arena now that recovers at a very delicate stage you know we 've got some momentum you know we 've hit a lot of private developers you know the carnies and the Goths and who made these huge investments into the city and I 'm a follower not a leader with those guys those guys are the ones that that started started the reinvestment but we 're in a very delicate stage you know we were are they going to go on we 're going to kick on it 's gonna be successful a vibrant what 's not so they 're going to stagnate it 's gonna actually get worse now this is you know you guys set it set here for the last few days I 'm winning this a bit but I 'm days of weeks money for something I want you know this is about something we need and I hear people say you know if we want to multi-purpose arena leg be pay for it mentally the point is we got to have this really we 've got to have it you know the need for the covered arena is that you 've got to do it not only do we have to do it but we 've got to do it now you know time is their enemy it 's uncertainty at the moment you know without it there 's a very likelihood that businesses will fail you know we at the moment you 've got the terrace operating their data quantitative but that another business and Victoria the felt without the multi-purpose arena a lot of businesses will fail now these are the exit we will not get this year so these are the experts will not get it sheared sling here on green or mass cake Mariah Carey so that Shania Twain

his game and the other one received which every cheerleader Europe with was an economic boom for Dunedin you know it was just it was just but it was economic disaster for Christchurch now you know I read stuff all the time and you know this is strictly out of the paper so it 's not 21,000 vehicles leave Christchurch to go to that debate in for that weekend so you know we we possibly let 's do any to 35,000 about and we 're not talking we 're talking to people that go out and if I took it to go to restaurants that you know the movers and shakers people with money they live town and they would didn 't need it they are the first big consoles they have a John concert and they had 35,000 people and they did research on half of the people that were from out of town 34 percent of those questions the average speed was five hundred and fifty eight dollars per person so that was a massive mess of food for Davina now if we adopt you know just for inflation and things so so we adopt 650 dollars per person of those 35,000 people that winter to do they speak twenty two point eight million in Dunedin our locals two percent of our population pissed off for the weekend and spent twenty three million in demeanor and this is going to happen time and time again we can 't afford to lose these people every time these if it comes along you know the most common question we might I deal with international retailers all the time with the farmers market and retail console you know the question they ask me what are you tourist drivers where the people coming from we cannot rely on just your residents we need to know where the businesses 've got a cowboy conceived when he really Fievel I 've got nothing else to tell her you know we don 't have the big tourist drivers and we need them and the CBD has got to be successful all these all these things that we want it 's only going to be paid for by a successful CBD now the wrinkles in the prime and CBD at the moment if you 've got prime potential mortgage 1,200 bucks um you know it 's about the maximum you get now I 'm doing the Hugo Boss holding on the corner as you know the prime minster at 1200 Manor the market strong you get a six percent yield that probably will yield about 55,000 and rates per annum just a single lingual building but if the businesses start failing it 's very weak you could expect the rich to have a business that closing and because you 've got a rating differential where you pay seven thousand a million for commercial and five thousand a million for residential the difference is that if that same building has a half the not want it so therefore they thought it will only realize 22,000 you know it 's a massive massive difference even thing we want can be paid for by a successful CBD if we don 't have the high rates to the scene after the CBD that just reverts to residential a recent week of Robin Williams concert in Auckland and my partner booked a hotel with the cheapest one I could get was six hundred eighty dollars you know you can get a hotel to crush its five-star for 180 this is the impact new that bits Park Arena has for the last three or four years there 's 60 to 70 events a year there 's 12,000 people right in the CBD now I 'm spoken to be the guys that manage that you know getting a mentor place and that telling me that most of those concerts they can get to Christchurch in that location with a covered stadium and the construction cost you know we 're in Wellington the book we spec stadium in the year 2036 thousand one hundred and thirty million the Dunedin Stadium got charged 20 million and interest I still can 't they don 't they 're given the money but anyway 220 million for them to even stay in when they are talking what 450 500 million less than that yeah it 's very cool so the time is animate if we wait another two years it 'll be 600 motion we cannot business case this is its builder this guy time is an enemy look I 've talked to my kids you know that tune in 14 15 16 the oldest ones going to stay here and I started talking about the multi-purpose arena selling that Katy Perry and echo more than some other revenue you know but suddenly they became excited you know in imagine having a multi-person Rena you know it 's 200 meters from little high and in the in the language and major going through the little high and the landlines back through the Reaper rebuilt soul squared back into the terrace you know right on the CBD if we have something exciting environment the hospice just telling to establish with this arena we don 't the country people will put Christ agendas number one or their events I heard a bit of dunedin city councillor that didn 't support the stadium who was a property owner in town his tenants told him after the other John concept the attorney over in the weekend of the Octagon concert was more than the whole previous month that 's the impact that these concerts can have on the CBD but it 's not just a hospital in that everyone assert that the accommodation is that uber drivers taxi drivers is Dmytro matters it 's even one you know we know here people to say oh well it cost by people because a guy that drives a taxi driving amendments that guy that and the diría that sells a moment supply it 's everybody you know if we 've got the opportunity the best multi-purpose arena and you know I 'm gonna say Australasia I mean I don 't know anywhere it 's so close and so connected you know we 've got that opportunity you 've been offered the lens free there on top of you 253 with it yeah she 's funny that I said these builders you 've got ten seconds but I wanted to ask you a secret question what just nothing to do with what your submission is about yeah but it 's to do with the tramway because we 've had a couple of submissions on this and there is a view that rather than going up the high street at all we should just do the loop around poplar lane and I 've spoken to you guys about open it 's all been resolved it wasn 't you yeah and the thing is the only reason for doing hurt was actually so that it wasn 't dug up again yeah so the question is is the question we 've got to consider as whether we actually just are satisfied with the with the loop and that 's the end of it and I think that that 's one that we will consider Shido the train stopped there it 'd be brilliant cuz I mean it 's literally across the road diagonal where it would have stopped okay all right well he had accessible city can one just talk about that no no no it 's just row books exhaustion we 've had pretty strong feedback from the public in terms of their feeling about road weeks and I 'm so glad I 'm a big supporter of cycle lane to actually take photographs of cycle Angela go on holiday but I hate your design yeah yeah you made the point in your submission thank you very much thank you thank you and our five _"

    "text": "Vince I Colts welcome good afternoon my name is Vince I Colts and let 's distinguish lady here it is isn 't my mother know we 're here today to to string the N Cape for the speedy completion of the cycleways Network and to speak against its postponement in the long term plan many have already spoken about in regard to the positive aspects of completing the individual cycle ways and the network as a whole especially in regard to cost effectiveness safety speed ease of travel increased use of local amenities and businesses as well as the healthy exercise and simple enjoyment of it as a social and leisure activity we completely agree and because any debate in most cases I am however concern that there are certain aspects which appear to being undervalued when it comes to considering the cycle network that being its part in the overall vision of the for the future of the city and also in regard to the current and future needs of certain groups of the disabled as you can see and the person as well now my co-presenter represents both survived the difficulties associated with wars in Europe and came coming from Holland in the 1950s and she chose New Zealand over Canada as it happens which was the family favorite at the time she initially came to Wellington City apparently in Christchurch now she has a hearing issues but having survived 290 that suggests that she has a suit of good jeans and has no son I 'm kind of hoping that 's the case now it could also cause be her habit of cycling every winter she came originally from Holland she used to cycle everywhere no not as many cars in those days cars and fewer everything was a bit safer she 's also a rate payer and has been since the 50s I guess she 's contributed a fair amount in that regard she also shared an idea back in 2011 and they 're still waiting for the resulting vision of the city to be fulfilled and regard to that overall vision of the city the Sheeran idea which is now six years old made it clear that the desire of the majority was put an that I believe gives the council effectively a mandate to work with and for and should form the baseline or a default that future planning should be considered against as submitters it can be frustrating to have to resubmit the same general information repeatedly for each new section or each new submission to cycleways the share an idea accessible city message should really have been banked people are often genuinely surprised that there is a need to reinforce this purpose point with each new submission when you talk to people about when you 're doing submissions etc and why they 're kind of wondering why it keeps cropping up again most of us tend to get a problem that we stab lenders to sort of describe as submitter fatigue takes a lot of energy and preparation to to submit each time additionally there needs to be greater awareness that the future usage of the cycleways network can continue to grow I don 't think that 's in debate and one of the biggest groups that 's just starting to respond to that is the retired senior sector now this portion some for some time to come and I think we all know this and we can all clearly see it and the Democratic says we walk around the streets now our society wants our older people to remain active and retirement exercise more live long live longer at home and we 're possible give them a reason to spend their money locally this is what we all want this is what they want hence the increased uptake in cycling the reduced cost of physical and mental healthcare is I think quite obvious as well the retired group also as a as individuals submitted to the sheer an idea six years ago but many don 't have the luxury of waiting for it to be completed especially another ten years my mother 's currently 19 and she 's waited six seven years already they need it completed as soon as possible and there are the practical types and modes of transport are also changing mobility scooters as you can see here and simile here there isn 't really a parking spot for mobility scooters pedestrians cyclists end should there be in in the first photograph showed tricycles various different forms electric bikes it 's a big one they 're going to grow exponentially not because people are lazy it 's just that it gives us an opportunity to go against the head wound with a little bit less effort a little faster it 's just easier and especially if you 've got other injuries or you 're not you 're feeling a little bit weaker in general the pressure and the obstacles on footpaths in the shared pathways is also increasing for a variety of things parked cars narrowed lanes which you find in various different places if you 've got three more slits it 's nice to go you we 've come to the end of the five minutes so if we could just okay yes three make your final point okay all right I just want to just flick through this is a scheme and in mark some of you may be familiar with to take out people from retired areas not all of them need to be senior I guess there 's meat mmm there 's nature yep it up on Facebook the corner of Cranford and Ennis Road yep she moved originally from address Street which was also scheduled to hear motivate to move to Cranford Street how many years ago now but now he hasn 't escaped to motorway no we haven 't escaped either like this given the fact that most vehicles traveling on this new routes are going to be transiting the area through suburban areas this is the best transit transport available yep that 's a very good note to finish on thank you alternatively or please please consider tread these cycle ways for the future this is true thank you very much thank you for your time and thank you for bringing your mother and as well as a co-presenter it 's just been taste oh thank you thank you very much _"

    "text": "jyllian if you 'd like to stay there and move on to your personal submission okay so my other submission is in relation to transport in the major cycle routes and I 've got a couple of different hats really so one is that I two years ago I finished my PhD and my topic was about adolescent cycling to school in Christchurch and then I have Elliot which is my because I 'm the mother of two two teenage boys who potentially could cycle to school but don 't one is just finished yet so you something that no two sacraments and I 've got quite a few selected but I 'm going to miss just about all of them and just talk about this one in terms of my PhD that is so I I think one of the most important things I four things I think it 's most important is about equity when it comes to cycling and provision for cycling and I 'm sure your food lots of all that benefits of cycling and I 've been thinking about them from a personal from a some people miss out and this people who are young in old females also miss out because there 's a lot less of them cycling and where there 's an environment that 's not particularly friendly to cycling which is common throughout the world in places like and also people of low economic stasis I think miss out they cycle a lot less than people home with height with wealthier and also if muscle becomes in the air I didn 't look as part of my research but definitely I think there 's some differences there 's some groups that Mercer and I would say in Christchurch it 's probably Marine Pacific that cycle a lot least then packing our people so I think there 's some equity issues to address but yes I 'm gonna skip through all eight and now just talk about mine and to lose my family perspective so this is a picture of my partner and two boys who keep growing and we 've done a lot of cycling trips over the is a lot of a cycle touring trips mostly not in New Zealand they 're babies but in terms of these kind of four types of cyclists I would say we 're down their end of the strong and fearless pretty much but despite that as I said at the beginning I they don 't haven 't cycled to school my other son he 's second one one day with me because I in the meantime was cycling all that time between well I would suffer from her power to the University of Canterbury back and forth all the time so he was talking with me one day we 've got about 200 metres down the road and a couple of things happened during that time someone backed up someone else did something else you said you were trying to kill us I said yep and so we carried on I mean you 've got to be really aware but yes so despite my all my work in my PhD I still haven 't let my children cycle to school and I think it 's most thing because I 'm I 'm worried about the safety so this this in particular this good interested in because it affects me the most because I come from Littleton and this has been my cycle well it 's even fear than oh yeah the universe I came to because further to it than that but this is generally my commute and you can see I 've tried to draw in there it 's like an expressway down on the right-hand side there so it would help me in particularly where it would help me as a relation to this part of the road and this is a serious photo I think and it 's from Centaurus right to the roadway over bridge we and speed limits just been increased to 16 last week so was 50 but this is the bit of the road I have despite the fact there 's a psychopath on the road that I find most daunting because of the big trucks that are right there so I avoid that because I can 't because I can 't back through the tunnels I have to get through somehow and so I even have to put my bike on the bus it will I 'm taking the car through the tunnel it 's a bit of the road and so consequently I don 't support any proposals to delay the establishment of the especially those 15 expressway but other other major stories as well there is some absolutely spot-on perfect timing but look one second yep [Music] I managed to find a copy in my father 's trunk because he died trees cycling and crushed it it 's produced by the traffic and transportation division in 1979 and it got some amazingly beautiful photos in it of and interesting photos you of 1979 in Christchurch but just two sentences I read at the end of it that 's it the ball is now rolling if the city is ever to have a fully integrated cycle meet with the impetus must be maintained there is no point waiting we need to get a hit of demand and act now so that 's eight years ago yep which is when I would have been sneaking to university yeah look thank you very much for your submission and it was fairly Balter to get that additional better thank you _"

    "text": "miss Gillian freighter here yes please come forward first of all the Littleton Tennis Club submission thank you welcome thank you correcto my name is Jillian Frazier and this is Christie Kona and we 're here for the Aleutians club but I 'm sorry I think for the people of Livington because the tennis courts in Littleton are open to the public so we don 't have exclusive use of them by any means and we 're a pretty tiny club and in case you don 't know where we are and even a lot of people who looks and don 't know who yes it 's terrible we a little turn of course but round if you have a ton of your to rights and it 's only going to cover this babe and you you veer off to the right there 's a small spectacle Chrissy Terrace and we 're up there so on the met it 's a little green log ground to the left which is labeled as Chrissy house well crazy house is writing Smith 's that 's why that 's there so they do aerial view so you 've got Chrissy Terrace can winding around up above and the all the green roof here is all creasing class which is just a big building these days and then two tennis courts are Mia so this is what the courts look like is just two of them and so that 's looking towards Chrissy Terrace sloping up to the back there and the wall at the back I 'll meet them there but again later because there is a wall that 's now I 've got another fence in front of it so because I think some engineers have seen thinness I needs to be replaced so who 's that there this is what the club rooms look like in 2011 so there 's a small little building there and and we thought organized in ended some fundraising it 's the back it was left a bit and we got some funding from Vodafone we 've got about 40,000 and so we 've got cracking and to save them what we saw is in has start voting so this is what it looks like now council contributed to the exterior painting and also to some of the plumbing associated with it so there 's been a bit of money invested around and in the area in the past that 's well I 'm one of my messages really that was our little opening I think council chair made a big mess oh yeah perhaps many pictures and we so we 've got a bit of a community basically all we do though we 're tiny we 're not Elmwood we 're not by Mary anywhere we 're not we 're tiny little Tina 's pub and most of what we do is around coaching for children 's so a few of the parents in and the children and chip in with working bees we also kind of monitor what 's happening with profession and things like that around the site and we get help from council was we had quite a bit of damage after the earthquakes so that was just on the lower area which is senior Terrace so that was what happened to me it 's quite it 's being fixed up so 's been problem so this is on the back wall they 7 War of the ports goes up towards some neighbors up above and that 's what it looked like down on the ground so not great for tennis because the but that 's the baseline near that we 're looking at so you kind of did this two years ago I think it was um I think it cost upwards of 200,000 for that so it was a big big undertaking so quite a bit of money invested beer and it 's just so many other graffiti but the thing is that they caught super still isn 't hidden e there 's been no change I 've been an intern for 27 years there 's been no change assured since then and this is what we have to deal with when we go down there in the afternoon on when those lessons are on and someone like me was to sweep this puddle which takes about half an hour and quite hard going and you kind of sweep and we 're at half the work I 'm switching back quite a little water sitting around on the court so that 's the current situation and and there 's also a few quite a few holes and the coolest ones off to the side back after 19 's you run off the court to the ball and this is on the other side so that 's with and that 's one of the lines The Devil 's lime so that 's within the port that 's it from the other angle so you don 't really want to run into those homes it 's a committed and this is the back room which is next to Chris of Terrace and we the the stairs were fenced off in fact they were fenced off but on the day when the building work was when the Builder was coming to work on the building and I got a call from one of the council staff in business you know we 're going to fence off the steps and I stopped because I bet I couldn 't get out fit but the Builder board built some different spheres a bit further along which but then just last year this other fence we tuck right next to the wall which is a little bit uneffective and balls go under there under that fence and then we just walk around behind the fence to pick them up so I don 't think well I going back money so it 's sitting there at the moment in its I guess pending some potential work in the future so I it looked like it would be it 's a massive job but the wall that 's been there for a long long time and nothing it hasn 't well it 's been there for the 30 years that I remove anyway so that 's the situation out there and my other point was is there in Littleton there 's not that much flatland so the things like tennis courts are quite valuable I know that just recently there 's been a move to make part of the grass just above the the arms wrinkle and on Oxford Karis available for the public all year round where is at the moment you can only go there if you scarcity of the flat flat land around there and I think that was part of the mass which is why it is yeah so I guess overall we we we 've been talking to counts of stuff for about the last seven years about this and we were just like if possible for some progress that we made in for it to be recognized is something that might get some priority in terms of the long term plan excellent oh did you want to add to it I know totally support everything to means it is we live alone save you tear so we see it being used by the public fili Kili in summer so it is very good all right any questions Phil so I 'm just wondering if it 's part of the funding and because you counsel our support you before if you 're aware of the community loan scheme so that of course that would have to be paid back it wasn 't like a grant that 's a good right Johnny oh sorry Andrew so are you aware of the Sports Network plan that 's can be broken every tennis I always get it rather have they talked to you about the priorities for tennis I can follow my council staff we 're working through the body for the cards like you know for that 's mainland football for 1000 it became incentive argument and they were getting a list of playing services fields that were a priority perhaps we could follow that up with what they 're sporting code Andrew thank you I 'm aware of the frustrations that you 've had as a group for some time I mean this obviously has been going on since the earthquakes and you know I was there at the celebration when the pavilion was reopened and you know it had always been my hope we would have had some of these things fixed before now but clearly this is quite a large project that involves some of some major works on the road reserve as well have you been any indication by our staff as to when those works on the road reserve and the retaining wall are likely to occur we keep asking but so first step would be to follow that up and then make sure that any works on the tennis courts follow but obviously to get this sped up and expedited as quickly as possible I 'm not sure if there 's a mean if there 's been any agreement to resurface the courts well that we have had some verbal agreements but you know officially whether this going to heaven or not I know that is the sounds like this probably going to have them but we we don 't have much information thank you very much for your submission but Gillian a few _"

    "text": "and Apollo power yokohama said margo welcome back afternoon right apollo power yoga limited has asked you to stop tilting the playing field so far in favor of suburban businesses and in doing that we 've asked you to go further than what you 're proposing and give two hours free parking off street and one Street for the benefit of people trying to come in and patronize city counts central city businesses right now the playing field is tilted very much in favor of suburban businesses it is really difficult to run a business in the Central City there 's it 's there 's still roadworks everywhere and I 'm gonna get back to that later it makes it very difficult to get to the businesses once they get here it 's difficult to find a park if they want to park on street I appreciate that now we 've got off street parking but a lot of people still want to park on the street if they 're just popping into a shop they don 't want to go to the trouble of driving up into a parking the process there 's still big gaps in between the buildings that are can make it quite intimidating to walk around the Central City and now we 've got homeless people sleeping in front of our businesses as well so it 's really hard anyway and then you charge for parking in the central city on the Central City on the city council own streets but you don 't do that in the suburbs so you give suburban businesses the benefit of having free parking right outside their businesses on the streets and you don 't give the same benefit to Central City businesses and it does make a difference it seems like a trivial thing but it make a difference so I 'm gonna tell you from the point of view of a central city business and also I 'm going to talk to you about the point of view of a central city customer what kind of difference that makes we ran the studio in Herefords Street in the ground floor of the others hotel for four years and because Amos my husband she set up the business set up Apollo a lot of people knew him they they knew he was a good teacher and they followed us into the central city and came to our yoga studio and when they stopped coming I would always chase them up and I would say well what 's going on you were coming to our studio no you 're not and they 'd say it 's just too tough getting past the roadblocks it stresses me out I 'm trying to go to yoga to de-stress and it 's forcing me out to get to your studio and I get there and it 's hard to find a park and it 's expensive it can have another six dollars onto the cost of an 18 class which makes it a really expensive class and so even though I don 't like the studio out in return or the wine out in tannery as much as your studio I give up I 'm going to them and when we moved Apollo out to Victoria Street in July last year they all came back we did 50 percent more business after a difference to Central City businesses because they can get to us they weren 't aren 't yet road blocks out in Victoria Street you can park around there really easily and the parking is only two dollars an hour and it made a huge difference a fifty percent difference to our business and that 's the story of every Central City business they 're getting that sort of dampening effect on who will come to them and is instead going out to suburban businesses instead of Central City businesses it 's that big a difference from the point of view of a customer I just recently I 've got contacted by a little dance wear studio that set up in your region Street and they said look we also have yoga clothing can you tell all your yoga students about our business and I said yeah that 's fine I better come over there and check you out first so I thought I 'd stop in on my way into the studio when I left myself so two twenty minutes to pop in and check to these people and drove round and round in circles not able to forget and you not able to find a park not able to get near and finally finally actually when I did and it was just because of all the detours it wasn 't_''_260.47 that I was trying to get close it was just the detours seemed to leave me further and further away from where I was trying to get when I finally got into the city council car park that 's in Manchester Street on the corner of Manchester and Gloucester that would be so it 's just a a gravel pit the way the rest of the parts but not as bad as some of them and there was one hour free parking there at that time and it just as a customer it really made me feel because I didn 't feeling up until then they just don 't want me here and you get there and I thought yeah maybe they do maybe they do and it 's you know it 's only a dollar or two dollars but it makes a difference to customers it makes city that they are wanted it makes a difference on the point of you know how much money do any of you know how much money the City Council gets from central city car parking on street parking and then the fines that result when people haven 't paid and after any of you know ten million ten million ten million dollars ten million dollars and that 's all coming out of the pockets of Central City customers so and I said it can be the difference between you know someone 's coming in and they 've got to pay six dollars to park and do their yoga class are they thinking and now I 'm gonna pop into that cafe and have a coffee know they 're thinking I 've already spent enough money and they don 't you know it so it 's all money that City Council 's getting and then you know you 're not you begrudgingly maybe possibly giving some back to the Central City Business Association nothing back otherwise to attract people into the central city you 're just milking the central city like that 's not right yes yep okay well I mean I just had one question is there a neat figure I mean does that include the cost of the wardens that go and issue the tickets and I don 't know I made an official Information Act request and they said the revenue from yeah it was about half and half revenue from actual people paying their parking fees and then their fines and it all added up to yeah close to ten million well there was one point five million dollar surplus last time we had a report yeah I 'm just gonna follow that one up because as it 's a quite important point Jamie did you would you be interested because obviously somewhere nothing is either free would you be open to council exploring if it was of a mind to continue this potential funding sources from the commercial raising differential and I guess the irony around that would be that it would mean that the West fields and Northlands and showplaces would be helping pay for symptom City parking which I actually quite like well in isn 't it because you 're providing all the suburban businesses with free parking on the streets in front of them they 've got the benefit of your streets for their customers and Central City businesses don 't so there 's actually a subsidy going in the other direction currently isn 't there this is I 'm just I 'm just asking from a funding source it is a submitter and business owner who 's in support of the free parking initiative is a funding source from that the commercial rating different through development contributions because that 's careful expenditure for the infrastructure this is an optics course but rights for instance is operational expenditure from the money going from right so if you put it on to the commercial raising differential that would mean that businesses such Westfield Northlands don 't hate it I get there but I 'm okay with you well I think you just need to make it fair I suppose you know if you were going to apply that you would have to apply it both Central City and suburban businesses it 's really all it 's you know setting up parking meters all up and down the suburban business streets in the same way as you do in the central city or whether you use rates as long as it 's fair to all the businesses is all that I 'm asking yeah appreciate it thank you it 's great today did anyone else have a question what no thank you very much Margaux great thank you _"

    "text": "next is Paul Lonsdale crash at Central City Business Association hi Brendan thank you again the Central City Business Association actually supports the extinction of the first hour free car parking concession from 33rd room through until the 31st of October 2018 so later this year this would get us through the colder months of autumn winter and spring which historically had a period of trading for retailers in the Central City we believe that awareness amongst Christchurch 's suburban population of off street car parking options in the CBD is not well developed at this time and that this is reflected in the low occupancy rates of the car park buildings continuation of the first hour free carpeting concession on 31 October will be a helpful tool to increase their awareness in grow use in buildings we assume that the Litchfield Street carpet building has been built for a 50 year minimum life and in that the Art Gallery basement car park is in the regenerating Central City environment that is to be expected that achieving a higher level of occupancy will take some time that use and patronage we believe that both the costs associated with building up their patronage overtime in the benefit to the business community of the first hour free car park and concession at this time should be viewed within the context of the 50 plus year life of the assets beyond 31 October this year is more important that the pricing is set to continue to build the patronage and use of filial Street Capac building in the art gallery basement car park rather than match pricing of competitor car park buildings when there is clear evidence that councils carpet buildings are achieving higher occupancy rates and then that would be the appropriate time to review pricing finding the optimal price equilibrium with demand and supply setting a price that produces a constantly low level of occupancy it 's not in the best interest of the Greater Christchurch community nor the Central City business community also Council could consider special pricing in it and initiatives when there are events on in the central city again this would be with the expressed purposes of attracting more people into the Central City events and at are open safe affordable and easy to use packing facilities it might also be a good time to review or consider the using the Litchfield streetcar parking building for hospital parking as an interim measure that we 've spoken about there previously so we 're not telling you what to do and respect of privately owned car park buildings we 're only submitting on the use of your ACS great Sarah thanks one of the things we 're a lot of the comments we 've had in the submissions are around helping support with businesses in the Central City and it 's what they tend to be framed as for doing it that way and a lot of the comments are at around you know more parkings free and we all know that 's not true and that the mall parking is actually covered by the rents at the shops pay to the to the landlord 's and and so the businesses in the Central City if they 're wanting people to live in free parking in the same way that malls do do you see us moving to a fashion we 're through a targeted rate or a bird or something like that where the businesses like they 're doing the malls end up paying flat first a free look perhaps but in the current environment that would be too great a burden to add onto the businesses that are trading in the Central City there 's certainly not booming and some of them are struggling so they 're edit cost I think you 'd find it have to find support and so because it 's effectively sort of a subsidy and in some ways into the CCPA are also asking for funding for the for the CCPA itself to help with those business enhance money typically yeah I guess we 'd see that that is two completely different issues I know council staff commented about the cost of the first air free and and even translated that into a an equivalent rates rise the hips it 's not quite the right way to look at those parking revenues the hips and the environment we have they just need to be redistributed a lot of on streetcar parkings gone needed to fill that gap the meantime but the parking is there like there 's enough supply that 's off straight beside markets gonna open up the end of this year yeah listening to is you central crisis is a regeneration project we 've lost eighty percent of our buildings in the inner city we 're only just really getting back to some level of normality we want a vibrant city and the only way you 're gonna get a vibrant city is try to change some of the habits of the people of change the episode of about seven years and so now they are doing something out of central and not coming in so we 're just trying to we want to see the council support giving these people to come in user facilities understood Central City and to do that we just see this as one of those could do it may encourage suspicion of these wanted man put it up so short yeah absolutely and what 's the cost of leaving them empty the car parks I mean is it really you know it 's you the air anyway why not have it full or at an optimal level of occupancy we 're not so interested in the cars to be honest we 're interested in the people that pop out of them and then walk around and do business and everything else in the Central City we 're not theater it 's not really about the cars your remains together people right no thanks I agree you know we 're probably still two years away in the Central City full recovery and if we spent billions of dollars in this area if we 're not careful that money 's gonna be wasted and I think we need to see it in that bigger context in terms of the parking charges I mean clearly the idea that this will cost money doesn 't make sense as people might not turn up so you actually don 't know who 's gonna come in but a specific question have you looked at you sort of alluded to it about variable pricing are there any systems in place where the pricing can actually change throughout the day depending on not it 's your car parking building 's full that 's one way of doing it but I don 't know if there 's any systems out there that you 've got a pretty smart system that 's being built in Dubai quite technology advanced this particular car pack so I 'm sure that with that technology there must be a way you can plug something in to attract early Packers attract people at certain times of the day to come in and shop yeah and maybe this phase off-peak times when you know this three o 'clock so obviously those times with DES are picking up the kids for school so maybe a time away from those other high traffic types yes I mean in a way that the three hours quite a blunt instrument it is but we actually had a system we said okay between these hours parkings fifty cents a day and great so and then mark at this time I think spinning and pork and I just asked you like car parking buildings like the one I 'm just wondering it like it 's a parking so is that how you see it in terms of like the range of modes that we are wanting to support and like including cycles walking and public transport and people being able to park their car is that I mean you want to give people the choice of how they want to move around the city with the soccer program bus lane of instructors input in and obviously slowing the traffic down on the central city so it 's more pedestrian finland friendly but we have to remember that parking is still an important aspect and we know with the crossing car park the the the decision around their car parks back just under three hundred million dollars of the reinvestment straight off the back of that decision we can 't forget that so that 's that 's the things that the businesses and the retailer 's look for when they 're actually making a decision on where they going to a co-located business thank you thank you very much for your presentation today that 's um it 's fine thank you very much thank you Mary system _"

    "text": "generation zero Francesca friendly good afternoon and welcome I 'm gonna make this very brief we are speaking today on again extending the one out free car parking our view is that we are thoroughly confused we understand that the aim of this trial was to encourage more people to come into the Central City so we can completely support that and post-quake Christchurch we can support that as a temporary measure but now it 's been proposed that this be extended so this is directly detrimental to your other efforts that you 're making of encouraging people to explore other transport options and enable that transport behavioral shift that I city needs we need to do this to reduce congestion which we we will inevitably get to and also a low-carbon future then to throw a spanner in the works the data that 's been collected by council staff actually shows that the trial hasn 't been successful so we really cannot understand why the house was considering extending this in our submission we copied verbatim watch the the staffs research findings were and that is that none of the parking supply and demand survey of the Central City late last year showed that the supply of parking in the central city exceeded the demand second point was according to the research the people that were interviewed expected to pay for this central city parking and they were concerned that this would undermine that general acceptance that car park should be paid for by the users and then lastly that the council just don 't have the money if they plan to extend this it will be a four hundred thousand dollar reduction in revenue so our last final point that we would like to make which you probably wouldn 't assume is that we actually do support the service that is provided by these parking buildings and it 's the private providers that are actually beneficial to our city and reducing the demand for on street parking and that way they 're actually freeing up the space were more active in public transport options so our concern is that by council offering this incentive it 's actually competing directly with private car park owners and operators and as 's all we 've got thank you very much is there anyone who 's got any questions I think it 's pretty crisp Oh deal yes do you um do you support people having they want to choose to be in a car that 's got emissions but they may have congestion but they 've got that heater and they 've got the music and stuff like that do you support them having those choices if they want to have those choices yeah yeah and but absolutely taking into consideration that we do need to improve our public transport and our active transport as well definitely I just think that the service has already been provided by the private businesses that are very they are providing a service that is not even at capacity I mean I know we 're that when the trial was happening that most of the roads around the carpark were closed and it made a big impact to actually be now to give to the place in the first instance yes but there was also this that actually there 's all the other places as wean like how long is this I mean if it is to encourage more people to come back into the city is this a year-long plan or are we going to keep on saying the regeneration it 's just failing because if we 're if we 're saying this because people can 't get a car park there 's something wrong with that rebuilding yesterday Yanni just to Christians was interested in the final comment he just made around how long given the comment that 's been made like the children Durham Street intersections been a complete disaster for about probably two or three years would you say I know you don 't support the principle of this but in terms of doing it for a continue it for a year is that something that you would support given that we 've been good see the network hopefully operating as it 's supposed to rather than all the road yeah I would I would say a year maximum we knew we want to say I said a at full capacity what is the long-term plan but also can we guarantee today the other question I had was we 've heard previous some of us talk about hospital car parking and we 've also had a lot of horror stories around people using private car parking you talked a lot about leaving it to the private operators for the off stream yeah are you aware of the kind of concerns that the community have raised in terms of the quality in the pricing and the expense that that has for people that you know when they do come in and use that operators compared to the public I probably can 't speak to that from my personal experience which doesn 't very validated the price that we 're paying for parking in Christchurch is nothing compared to any of the other cities in New Zealand I yeah it should be a deterrent and it isn 't at the moment and it does seem and so it is still enabling a lot of people to depend on driving into the city and not exploring those other options that should be used for people that cannot explore those other options yeah okay I explore other options are the ones that are hardest by the private yeah and yeah sorry I counts NATO from my experience yes no Sara I think so they um if we were to try something different would you support something along the lines of non is very free first out but at lower cost of street parking but doing other things to encourage people to get off street rather than being on straight yeah I think I think there would be there would be a good option but I 'm sure that will provide would be popular with the private providers that if it was you know encouraging but maybe a lower rate as an educational sort of practice to encourage people to get used to if you 're going into town don 't expect to get in on on the street car park you need to go directly to the building yeah yeah yeah we could support that yep Dion just another line of would you support validated parking so people that come into the city centre they utilize services or have a look around and they show do that and other centers hmm all right look thank you very much for your time and trouble much appreciated _"

    "text": "Oh Connie Christensen welcome different location now but good afternoon thank you very much for since you speak again about the the plane that has been put out for submission on extending the one hour free parking tax boom first of all I 'll say this I struggled to see how the suggestion fits urn with the council also planning to be carbon neutral by 2030 I understand this various different theories behind trying to get more people in in cars and offering free car parts but I don 't see how that in any way shape or form really fits in with some of your other plans so that is a mystery to me and I 'm obviously not in favor of you extending this and it seems that the vast majority of the cars that I see driving around our single occupancy cars so offering more people to untried to entice more people to come in and cars to me really just increases congestion it increases noise pollution and the danger for other people such trying to get around I thought that the council was actually trying to the very clear statement that the people of Christchurch came up with in share an idea where they would really like a much more sustainable green friendly and saintly to all modes of transport for everyone to be able to get around Christchurch and the city centre specifically they wanted more green space they wanted a better walking facilities to be able to walk around and for businesses to thrive so that you can walk past it or buy anything if you drive past a business you buy stuff when you go past slowly and that goes fool no matter whether you 're coming in the car and a bus or on a bike or whether they walk the whole way in everyone has to walk to the shop and into the shop so the number one is that it needs to be nice experience and inconvenient and safe for people to look around in Christchurch I 'm as strong as suggest that you you look at instead of providing free car parking which only really will benefit those who actually want to drive on that maybe you put extra that was free before the earthquake and they really seem to do a very good job put that in and spend some extra money and make it really really good and really frequent if you need to have two routes of those going around because that will actually benefit everyone you could even implement it to try and help out the the hospitals that are struggling so that people could possibly use your car parks to to gate and again access to outpatients at the hospital but also the bus exchange and the other car parks to need work with that shop with us I think that would actually benefit a lot more people so yeah that 's my main points I think the money should really be used putting in the shuttle bus instead way bid I mean thank you any questions I think you 've made your point very clearly thank you very much _"

    "text": "the multi-purpose arena trust Barry Meister I thank you mayor for the chance to to again present and I admire your collective stamina for the for the task that you are undergoing I first of all just acknowledge Brian Vassili and Natalie Sain and Malcolm Hudson who are part of our trustees and will help this morning first of all I 'd like to acknowledge that we have made some progress in recent times the government commitment to an infrastructure fund has been helpful and I 'd also like to acknowledge the work that your staff have done with us we 've found a very collaborative relationship with your staff who have done a lot of work behind the scenes and been very helpful to us and I also acknowledge merely in your clear public support for a stet multi-purpose stadium as a priority for the city we welcome that support we welcome that leadership and we thank you for it there are just five points that I want to make today the first one is just a comment on our trust group our multi-purpose trust we have been submitting since the earthquakes we are a non partial group we are non-political group we are a group of cantab ratepayers who are passionate about this project we have been consistent in our view about the multi-purpose nosov this project that has been consistent a project which has the potential to be utilized 365 days a year that has been a consistent view we 've had and we 've responded to every twist and turn and the development when Minister woods recently indicated that she wanted to look at combining the Metro Center with the multi-purpose arena our trust produced plans to indicate how that could work at our expense we have been flexible we have tried to respond to the twists and turns of which I 'm sure there will be some more we are fully committed to seeing this project through second point we believe there is a real groundswell of support in the city and we say that because we get out and about and we have engaged with a lot of community groups and we can now say that we 've got a whole lot of groups Kennedy University in the University Students Association the hospitality sector and Bryan 's going to speak to that in just a moment the committee for Canterbury numerous community groups the type of you three a Rotary groups that we 've been out and about around the Selwyn district council city developers I think Richard Peebles making a presentation himself later this afternoon he 's part of our trust large city professional organizations that we 've spoken to and of course the sports sector at large I think we could probably add ed Sheeran to that list because he seems to be quite in favor of covered stadia to come and do his thing so I think the the common view is that we need certainty we need direction but the notion of let 's do it seems to be a popular cry today and I think we could say that from the groups that have supporting the third point I want to make a comment about is about major events my work involves working for major events New Zealand and I 've just come back recently from the major events events people get together it 's an amazing conference and it 's a wheeling and dealing type of thing where major events get put up and propositioned and there was something like 68 cities there which Auckland was one of them what it reminded me is that multi event facilities are the best tool you can have in your toolkit when you 're talking to major event organisers they want certainty they want to know what they 're coming to and that 's why we need certainty I appreciate that the multi-purpose arena is only one part of Christchurch 's multi event strategy but it 's an important part what we need is certainty so that we can do the wheeling and dealing and talking about bringing events here with certainty about times and dates the fourth point I want to make is about the basis of our submission is to urge you to bring forward and appropriate the funding which has already earmarked in the long term plan that is clearly what we 're not asking for more money we 're asking for an appropriation of the money which is that each year we know that the cost of this facility will increase the cost of maintaining the temporary stadium will increase and the opportunities the delay in realizing the economic benefits to the city will also accumulate so we believe that the timing is important hints we 're asking for thus bringing this forward we also hope that the business case can be motivating be activated pretty quickly we are aware that there 's been a lot of consultation a lot of reports and I think the last thing we need now is another tier of consultants and consulting because there should be enough work being done for the business case to be properly put in place and I hope it 's pursued rapidly final comment is about a possible role for our trust going forward this is not about our trust we don 't have egos we don 't care who gets the credit or the blame it is about us as a trust wanting to keep the project moving forward in a coordinated fashion and if there is a role for us going forward we can in that and we might make a submission to you all of this is about the strong belief that this project can add to the spirit and the pride and Christchurch that 's what it 's about the spirit and pride of Christchurch has been knocked around and we believe that bringing the city this into the city of central city activates pride and spirit and that 's really the most important that we have to offer and submit you no pause there just ask for Brian to make some comments from the hospitality sector thank you thank you mirror and counselors it 's certainly a pleasure to make some comments on behalf of the hospitality sector I think you 're pretty aware the the sector 's under pressure the hotel rooms that we had at the time of the earthquake were around 3,700 we 're down to one to two and the occupancy and their their rates are well behind Auckland Wellington and Christchurch and what was the reason why it 's happening why is it happening is the delay in getting Christchurch back up and running at the convention business in New Zealand that delivered a hundred million dollars an economic benefit that 's gone we 're punching well above our weight the lion 's test here we we hosted a midweek game we got five thousand two hundred and sixty nine domestic visitors and there was an economic benefit than 19-hundred international event visitors they 've been an economic benefit of 8.3 million look at Wellington they had a hurricane 's game on the Saturday second test on the following Saturday 16,000 and international visitors 21,000 an economic benefit of 30 million Auckland got around about 70 million and there 's still a lot in the community that figure and still talk about the stadium being a rugby stadium it 's not a rugby stadium it 's rugby is important yes we want to get back to a great test we want a good place to support our great Crusaders team but there has been a change in mindset you know the entertainment today there 's a key driver of domestic tourist activity so you know we 've got a we 've got to participate and we _''_485.93 get any any chunk of that is through a multi-purpose roofed well-thought-through stadium talking to the airport guys they say the their busiest days are when there 's a major event or made events outside the city surely as shareholders in the airport do you want to see that Airport busy when people are coming to this town Malcolm Jones tells me that a visitor to an event in Christchurch spends six times more than the local resident going to that that that event and I know that the greatest he also says the the greatest patronage going to Forsyth Barr comes from Canterbury people now there 's no doubt a vibrant hospitality sector there 's important for the well-being of the city I think you 're all aware of that our members are proud can tabs you know we want to see our city succeed and we 've only got a ring reading the paper we 've got to learn from Auckland 's conservative decision in terms of when they revamped Eden Park and what are they doing now wanting a major covered stadium I want to back a three-year plan we urge you to work well with government and and make the right decision because remember this decision is going to affect this city for 50 years together let 's make Christchurch New Zealand happening City Stadium brings that really good feel-good factor to a city and generates money in the local economy when the in the business cases are done I mean the hospitality hospitality industry are weighing up the things do you take into account the fact that the 253 million dollars which is the ratepayers share if you like it 's money that first has to come out of ratepayers pockets if you like to test interest over time and so you 're taking 253 million dollars out of the economy to start with so to make up for that over time you need to bring an external funding you could certainly view or deny in a very sort of insular way like that but if you look at all the businesses that are struggling and paying right I 'm sure that 's going to offset it you know the generation you just think of people come to the test with 60,000 yeah you 're taking the money out to make yeah well a lot of isms based and investing serious there 's money in this city look thank you very much for your submission it 's much appreciated and but we 've come to the end of the time so thank you very very much _"

    "text": "Delta Community Support trustee and Boone can you give me yes welcome thank you thank you for your time today I realize it 's very precious you 've heard a lot of people speak my name is Ian burn I 'm the CEO of Delta Community Support Trust just briefly we 're a Christian social service and Community Development Agency in Richmond in Northeast classic we work with about two and a half thousand and marginalized low income older adults and intellectually disabled people a year and we provide about twenty five thousand instances of services I 'm here to address the proposal a long-term plan to reduce community funding by a million dollars please ask you not to do that for two reasons firstly what I would like to say though is you 're gonna hear a lot of people saying things aren 't good enough today what I would like to really commend you on is the work that 's going on with the library but sports facilities and I was in the art gallery recently they 're just all there 's it 's a really good space with though is that they will not make a lot of use of those facilities because some of them can 't read very well in case the library because art really isn 't in this scope at that level on the whole because and they don 't come into town a lot because everything when we get here costs money to do so that 's well I 'm just like to identify here this is a whole strata of Christ to society which well all the things that are being done a wonderful doesn 't particularly benefit them and I 'd like that to be recognized when you consider your funding options around this thing these projects have got hundreds of millions of dollars going into them I recognize a lot of those earthquake money I just asked you not to take a million dollars out of the social services funding because it 's a whole sector of Christchurch which still really needs it after the earthquake just to clarify on that Christchurch still has really high mental health stats particularly for children and young people in low-income disadvantaged groups facing have been moved around a lot and had the parents have had to fight EQC and insurance battles as well as the effects of the earthquake as health so we 're beginning to see a lot of more disturbing behaviors coming through in that group as well that 's not our focus but there are a lot of people in agencies who will be affected if you cut the funding situation we focused more on middle-aged and older adults but even for them the earthquakes and some of the EQC related issues have put them over the line from just coping to know I 'm not coping anymore and while I recognize the mental health is not specifically a CCC function the funding that you are providing in normal text is so keeping the city sane in the solution works because of supporting people and giving them places just to come and be and be listened to and heard and respected and giving them opportunities to move on and grow as and when they already so the CDHP tends to focus on the three percent of the population girls 17 percent that doesn 't and often what we 're doing is when people get pointed within these CDHP services that going in they 're coming out they 're coming to organizations like us and we are being the community and support for them as that happens and we get no mental health funding for that because that 's not what cd8 response so yeah that 's what I really want to say thank you very much for your time today all the best enjoy deliberations thank you very much and thank you for what you do I mean we 've all been to the Delta and you know know what a valuable support that you provide the city I just wondered if you were aware date the million dollars that we took from that fund was so that we could attract another million dollars from central government so two million dollars was placed into the and to the community well-being and resilience fund the partnership fund in it yes so it 's actually increased the amount that 's available to organizations in order to to grow the community 's for themselves so it 's a it 's more of a capacity-building approach to the community working with the council and not yeah trying to build build capacity so there been a number of grants that have been made to it already so I mean be happy to supply that to you if you want to get a a general impression of where we 've gone with it just signaled that that wasn 't clear to me reading the LTP okay you 're saying that but it 's beautiful all these lovely facilities in the central city yep anything we can do about it through this process I think I don 't know I mean I 'm just aware that because it 's a central city if you go in and you want me all you need to buy it here we run a group called explore which we take groups of people into other parts of the city and try and get them to feel comfortable in utilizing those spaces that often we find that people haven 't_''_373.68 been to different places around the city just because it 's I don 't even tell you the answer I 'm reading a stat that a school in Hornby at one stage 20 percent of people have never been to a question beach because it was just not within the way they operated to think I 'll getting a personal go down there that 's a really good question but um yeah I think also though it 's about tone of the facilities that we 're dealing with and if they 're if buildings are designed and activities are designed largely by people from well-off educated middle class backgrounds then that 's who they 're going to attract and at that kind of policy planning stage need to think clean thank you thank you for your submission in will you see it 's people irate in the city so we you know someone at a new stadium others in many you 've talked about today at the other end of the kind of needs spectrum wanting those basic needs met so what 's your overall sense of whether cities it I think we 're moving forward and it is great to there is a whole semi forgotten part sorry it happened it was there before the earthquake that some other things have been exacerbated by the situations one of our workers one of our workers is heavily involved in working with homeless people in Latin squares well that 's not actually indicted but she does an amazing work and there 's that whole cross-section of society that 's happening I think I don 't have these figures but I suspect that that that pop it sector of the population is growing and there are people working several jobs and if they 're not unemployed they are now working poor and those are things which you need people who need to be kept in mind as decisions are made thank you no look thank you very much for your submission as a corporation thank you very much thank you _"

    "text": "um Monica Beaumont good afternoon how do you do nice I see you hopefully this will work because I hear you 'd be having trouble so this is a difficult sort of presentation for me because I 've been involved with here just cause us after the earthquake and it 's something that I feel very strongly about and sometimes I feel like I 'm a little bit too so I 've put this helping presentation together so hopefully it 's a little bit more concise then potentially what I could be so here it is funding why it 's so important here 's an example of someone reinventing themselves this is a photo of my friend Dave who owns galaxy Records like me after the earthquake we were all forced into such a restaurant into situations of reinventing ourselves and following our patients and like me we 're very much High Street people and I realize once the thing had been body managed that the High Street was really in jeopardy so I 've pretty much dedicated all the post quick time to try to help present these buildings first came to Christchurch I really thought this was a satellite so then I had no real sense of place and so when high street ones body bags I really felt like I had no connection to the city and I realized I was I 've said the voice so a lot of other people that felt the same way a city has changed forever we 're not going to get back we 've lost around 250 listed heritage buildings since the first earthquake I think one of the hardest things for me was that most of these buildings were actually repairable and this is why I think it 's so important that we keep the funding the way it is because there 's so very few actual buildings left and we need to trigger those that are left particularly the illness that he wants which you know very commercially viable so examples of buildings that you know had benefited from grants that we all enjoy I recently which was sale its the moles house and the lived here and it was just a wonderful experience I walked in there me around and talked to me about the huge the building it was just a wonderful experience and you just don 't get that kind of connection with new buildings and so that that 's in my local community to which you know is lovely and also the theater at night speaks for itself Cafe Roma also known as the middle and building this is another 16th counseling council founded success stories and I 've just put a quote and I think I really serve she has sentiment to I think that these buildings have good bones and I think with council funding that makes it a viable prospect to owners to actually kind of get these buildings up and running again so this if I wrote me now with Midland building and it 's part of the interior cafe I wanted to get a couple of quotes from proper developers and I thought probably one of the best ones would be shortstop okay he 's someone who 's them pretty much passionate about it security buildings and particularly in the High Street area and for me I think like business and reflect cultural and aesthetic values of such enterprises without proper funding these developments but most likely though he had not go ahead and his personal response to that statement was funding is often the difference between saving or not saving heritage building owners and potential owners of heritage buildings need councils financial support for us to make it happen I wanted the opportunity before I finish to talk about the Holly building obviously there 's the proposed hotel and subsequently the building 's demolition and I just think this that this is a really kind of disappointing outcome probably because we 're losing we don 't have so many of these commercial buildings of the scale left and I think when you look at 69 Wooster Street building the scale is attractive the scale is friendly pedestrian friendly and the styles were in keeping and I think also in the area that is a cultural and heritage area so another reason I spoke to Chris cherry from workshop he 's been a long-term client and he 's sort of been asking me for a long time after the suitable for his situation Monica that 's also come to the end of the five minutes so did you want to show any other pictures before you wrap up okay not to speak to them honestly we have to move on and that that the the the slides will go onto the hub so that all of the counselors will have access to them but to Beefeater other submitters that have been all given the same amount of time I have to wind it up I 'm sorry thank you very much thank you _"

    "text": "again with Michael Duhamel welcome they want to counselors to imagine for a moment how could they have won a prize and they 've been given a two-week cruise on the Pacific Canadian Coast and they have flown out through Auckland big airport may we all prepare to fly through crushed it they transfer to a smaller flight to Vancouver and go down to a big earth and join get onboard a large cruise ship and it sits off and they spend a night or two finding out how it all works and where the casino is and what character what cafes to avoid and discovering whether they feel seasick or not and it calls into another port which has a container crane hanging over the birth and bus is sitting on the concrete they are waiting to take them to the local town and they do and they go and they have a cup of coffee which wasn 't very good and they get back on the ship and the next day the ship calls in to a charming little X fishing port with a little ball and it so they had to get onto the ship 's lifeboats to come ashore and you get ferry or onto a wharf and there is an idyllic little town with nice coffee available and souvenir shops so they can buy something for auntie and that 's actually a Poirot it is the ideal little of Rose port people love coming to recover people even even Christchurch people love going there but if you 're on a cruise ship it 's very special and acara has it probably no one the accolade of being the best destination in Australasia this last year it beats Cannes and it will beat our wrong and beat New Plymouth 's and all the others around and that 's partly why this year there are 91 cruise ships due to visit a Corral that 's a huge number what 's more if you 're the cruise ship operator you only even if it got quite a big ship you only have to pay about 15,000 to berth in the harbor and get your people there there 's about 10,000 to the city council figures of the wharf over the edge and it 's also if you 're traveling for in Wellington and Dunedin it 's a relatively straightforward trip in from Akron from Dunedin up from the sauce date or slightly as you day as you go around the peninsula and onto Wellington or back the other way this year there are I think 14 ships do to call into Littleton ships even the present ones according to wrecker are quite free to call it a little too loose enough depth there there 's a big wolf there it 's got container ten cranes hanging over it there 's nothing stopping them doing that but they choose to call into Aurora the ship 's engines if they 're coming into a Corral and they have to run it had to run about two hours three hours less than they would if they 're going around the peninsula and calling into Littleton that 's what eight or ten tonnes extra fuel oil at how many thousand dollars a tonne I don 't know the accountants must love calling it a wrecker it 's so much cheaper and if and use of the tigress and the pilot bird and everything else required mean that if they call into Littleton they 'll get charged something in the order of a hundred thousand dollars on the port company 's current charges if there 's a new birth in Littleton and that person is going to get paid off and it 's cost sixty million and sixty ships to visit a year or something it 's going to add another hundred thousand dollars to their cost of visiting Littleton so they 're going to be paying out towards two hundred to visit Littleton and still only 15,000 to visit her karora now in a Corral there is a problem there 's a real health and safety problem with the surface of the Agoura wolf I don 't know if you 've been done it recently but there are holes if you 're wearing high heels you 're certainly a trip there are no handrails there 's no shelter from the South earlier there 's no shelter from the nor 'westers and their shelter from the Sun there 's not even a sign panel chat at the end of the wharf that 's the information office there is a lot of Road cones which is your bus depot it 's not well organized and yet as I said 91 cruise ships is here it is urgent that something be done at the same time the concerns have not all been processed yet for the crews ability Middleton there 's still a bit of bridging consent required before the port company can even think of starting to build it or finish designing it that means that there is 50 to 60 million that isn 't being spent at the moment where the interest on that money is not required at the moment I don 't know how that is being financed I haven 't_''_310.69 been able to find out I think it 's the City Council underwriting or saying that it can 't they will accept lower dividends from the port company and effectively but it means that there may be more dividends available for another year from that 60 million dollars investment either or money that doesn 't need to be borrowed there forgone interest if you like on what would be spent on a little converse so this is a project where there is money available unlike many other ones that you 've heard about actually I think that the council could probably cancel the cruise berth in Littleton and save itself 50 or 60 million dollars I think I might just in things the air not because of the content of the submission but we 've come to the end of the five minutes well know we 've we 've we 've come to the investment I 'm sorry um you know these these processes are what they are but we have to move on to the next matter it 's only fear that then thank you thank you very much Michael I mean I think you 've made your point very powerfully anyway my _"

    "text": "afternoon yata good afternoon mere councillors my name is stylish and I live just across the road from you Art Center there since the beginning of the 1980s and I am most apologetic that despite my long personal experience in local government I have not managed to put up the slide for you to look at however I do have some extra copies from the five copies that I supplied to Lee have you got this with an email copy right but but when you have just email it through and they 'll put it on the hub true okay I know that you 're rid of my submission so you know that I 'm very much for public transport I am actually concerned that we do have a fuel tax which will actually reduce rates and serve to increase public transport I actually support a number of things that are in the long-term plan but I 'd like to focus in this five minutes on the Heritage Area which is just across the street from you and I have been a member of ikon since the beginning it was concern people had been that a very precious area of public and private buildings into architecture were being lost to what was convene specified departures and in the planning documents since this areas had special provisions that exactly predicted it and it has continued through the district plans to try and protect this particular area which is actually set if you go from Billy Avenue South to Cambridge south from Billy Avenue to south to Cambridge Terrace it 's bounded by Victoria and Durham Street and even the open river to the east and Rolston Avenue and Park Terrace to the west now it has been acknowledged by many people including leading heritage experts that this area contains quite extraordinary examples of residential domestic architecture as well as public buildings public architecture and the built characteristics come from the Victorian and Edwardian architectural elements in those residential buildings and an identification of social and cultural history in the surroundings and as I say these have been acknowledged in the past now I would just note that I was delegated by our home the inner city West Neighborhood Association icon which on the Christchurch replacement district plan outlining provisions to retain and manage the character and heritage areas of the residential area of in the vicinity of the Arts Centre and surroundings and we actually we had a glitch there because the area has been decimated by a earthquakes people were very shaken and the person within icon delegated to make a submission and the original plan misunderstood the context the and what was required and I technical details the submission which I was thinking to call to put forward later didn 't hold because we hadn 't made that original submission with the technical details of exactly where rules might be changed or the area might be covered it was a very general solution and so although there was a great sympathy from the city council representation there and the staff knowing the value of the area and the expert witnesses that were happened to be around and there still is great sympathy in the heritage unit for the value of this area it has not been adequately protected and consequently I 'd really like you to consider sentence and have to do by it a planned change and I 'd like to see the city really consider a plan change to be in it to be led by the city to retain this very important area and I have actually a map of the area see buildings clustered around Gloucester Street north and south Worcester Street the Art Center is obviously included comes down as far as the north side of Castle Street with just a few buildings on the south side I would really recommend that you consider that and incentives of support that can sustain the interim period in tulip plan change can be achieved and those incentives and support could include advice and promotion of heritage especially domestic architecture and heritage can carrot in character areas funding to support heritage retention I think this is really really important and I have already mentioned ethnicity plan in the submission I made waiving our refund of resource consent charges as it 's done in other cities design guidelines and active encouragement and and engagement for heritage and finally the council LED plan change to achieve what we called in encompassing a heritage character area and I 've actually listed in this mission some of the ways that this could be achieved I might say that in the attempts to actually come in rather late in the plan as I 've mentioned when I was called in I did go around and talk to a number of landowners and God quite amazing amount of sympathy from people who are in buildings that are in the process of being the earthquake repaired or could be bowled over and replaced with new buildings and even speaking to some of the Clifford family who actually are very sympathetic and own still quite a lot within the area I think that you know we need to draw in Christ college and we need to draw in other people but I didn 't really get this I felt really excellent support from some people that this from landowners that this could be something that if it was really you know pulling the city council and the leadership pull together and and indicated strong support for doing this sort of thing we could retain this visitors to the city it is there 's no interpretation to explain why no Diana we have a number of challenges with their district play and capacity to make changes to it as you know and I 'm also going to suggest that you you have this conversation with regenerant christchurch because there is a regeneration planning process that is available to the city at the moment which may in fact encompass what you 're proposing and a far more and aged way then then a RMA process which would involve appeals and various other things so look thank you very much for your submission I know that there 's a lot of support around the table for what you 're talking about so we 'll have a good look at that but if you could email through I will be additional information that would be great and thank you I really appreciate your activity and I 'm sure you 'll do what you can do you think there are limitations thank you okay so we 're now adjourned until 30 that would be great so _"

oh just quickly spin through that that 's now pictures of spins apart and order I 'm Barry Robison actually a member of the structure of the committee that between back for waiting it 's just his skateboard I have initially started morons can I go on she 's called penis yep they 're still Pina graves they should come under B Robertson should be soon that 's what you still under penis so everything that we have received is just she said shouldn 't rather what 's happening to the river how it 's been neglected and left natural I think this is a cheaper option than actually spending the money to actually get it back to its service or life this the Styx River was running fine but back in the sort of mid-90s they did the north of subdivision and under the northward subdivision they put approximately about a metre council engineers decided to put a pond in lake endure in the actual upper catchment of the sticks Mill Road now when they did that actually notified them and said I think you 're running a hell of a risk putting it there because that is where all year Springs come up but they assured me they knew what they 're doing but it turned out they didn 't and they dug into the aquifers they dug and isn 't so much that actually dropped the whole pressure for the whole of Northwood and Belfast and because they dropped the pressure of that what actually happened is a lot of the streams around Belfast went dry so what secure that problem they put a well in there to feed into these streams this is pure artesian water I would just go back to the first one the water that 's coming out of that mining area that they 've actually dug up is actually there 's what 's increased originally increased the flower of the Styx River and it 's the it 's pure artesian water and it 's the New Zealand and flowing straight into the Styx River and straight out to sea and flooding it keep flooding people downstream because of the when they put that in the drop the aircraft pressures and what they 've done to compensate for that is because the streams running dry they put another well in and Belfast and they pump pump this water not a lot of pure artesian water they pump it into some of the stranger Belfast they pumped in 24 hours a day even when the sticks is in flood even the rivers of flood and just that one small well alone which is a token of the other there 's enough pure artesian drinking water to feed the Holy Spirit in require with drinking water there if you put the two combined it is actually billions of multi millions or billions of dollars worth of artesian drinking water that that 's flowing into the sticks and flowing out to sea it seems to total waste and with the combination of that and the combination of all the silk that 's been put in there which was acknowledged the flow the actual increase in flow has met by Neera but it 's also been hidden by the engineers again by changing the metering point which used to be on my son 's robe they changed the metering point of the Styx River back to Red Cliff Road and that doesn 't include the Kappa Tony River so so by that but still even with that in mind the results still show the huge increase in would a flow that 's been going on with all the subdivisions and the acknowledgment of all this salt that 's coming out through the subdivisions they actually started to dredge around the loop of the radio tell Thea now that work was started and it started just before winter and because of the winter and driving their trucks out there it was proposed to leave it off for a couple of months it was put on hold for a couple of months and then has never been completed since the mid 90s to the stake that the money for that was taken over by the beautification which XE run the river near a river they want it to flood because it 's in their interest because they are buying up all the land that 's flooded at a cheap rate for the source to the sea now that 's fine if they want to do that but it 's still what 's happening is because of all this flooding the engineers have come back thinking oh we 've got some liability here so what they 've done is have changed all the farmland around the area to floodplain and flood management to compensate for all the money made by the sub dividers upstream we are actually paying for that and integration of our land now if you want to have the river you either have it as a drain for subdivisions or you have it as a as a river now the only way I can see you can doing that is to put a rowing lake that runs from from the two K stretch from the end of where the rubber meets the road again from the plantation down to spits or the secure case straight the land is actually for of the river with the natural geology of the land to flow there and it can be done at very cheap price and it 's a lot cheaper option than been spinning 50 or 100 million what they trained to dredge the whole River Dam it would also cut down on the we did accost the maintain its cost and the beautification people can have their river flooding at that part we 're sitting there and it won 't affect other people 's land with it flooding yep we 've come to the end of the time that 's been allocated and I 've reset the alarm I 've reset the clock when your slides weren 't working so yeah what I was looking for is even even a some development money for investigating this option well I 'm gonna sort of defer to the process that we 're in at the moment so yeah we will consider all of the options that are presented to us before we make any any decisions yeah thank you very much for your time thank you _"

    "text": "Penelope Hargreaves hi you listening to me welcome many I 'm not sure how I will call this watch watches I don 't just have to sit back here at home but I then I think have to push a few battles and have a push the right ones um I 'm pretty high priestess you know and I 've got a property which was a small farm out of those sticks Road which has about least 2,000 meters of the lowest of the sticks river running around it I moved to this property in 1992 immediately after the drainage board had actually changed over to for the rubbers looking after bad counsel the last time the river was dredged at my property was 1994 until 1997 and the council were doing a very good job clearing out all the trees making sure the river was dredged and the river was fully free flowing and suddenly in 1988 the whole policy has actually changed we have been battling for so many years now for the counts and engineers to walk to talk and nothing has happened nothing at all the contributes to the problems for the well heads that these rivers are flooding I 've got a small video stick video which is actually being put in today which actually shows the river from Marshalls Road down to Brooklyn and it shows with well headers there is no way that wellhead can be made pure water to be sure as it stays pure force principle Brooklands and k anger because it 's right with the water floods the ground has dropped in the 2012 report that mr. Harrington put out he he said ground to drop there and it 's croc dropped so much that the waters actually not reaching for gates now the counts are completely dependent on crypt information presented to them by the council experts and that recently talked on the radio when there were abusing the council and the mayor for these problems with the chlorination you can only act on what the experts information is given to you and the moment we are actually looking at a situation where the engineers have to be transparent and they have to be accountable for their actions because sticks location I 've put together a photographic then just to try and explain to you what the situation is out in the six catchment which is actually disaster waiting to happen and the disaster waiting to happen is the contribution of the Waimakariri which is known as the most dangerous River in New Zealand and has flooded christchurch many times if you look at sorry I 'm doing the wrong way which way don 't we go the backwards if you 're not number one you will actually see that that is the flood gates now the flood gates a lot of the sticks and Brooklyns and they 're really important because they well the importance of them is is that they actually act as a planning intersects with up because when the one material tide is high '_''_204.04 the gates closed by the weights and so therefore normally they 're closed for two hours each side of high tide total of six hours a day but when the wayne act is higher the tides are high they close for three hours each side of high tide and if closed literally most today so if you have a flood and crash trips you 've got all the water coming down sticks where does the water go it cannot accept so all it does is back up and we 've got such a huge increase in in water being put in from subdivisions into the sticks it 's actually flooding when we don 't even have any rain and it 's flooding right up as far as masters Road which the other people have actually explained to marina Wireless I think she showed you some photographs of that so I won 't going to do that the next picture Alex you put up here is from Macpherson 's map this is an ek map that was given to me and show the purple lining is the double stop thinking of the Waimakariri 400 kilometers now that was put up because of the way my career flooding through Christchurch if you look at the cross I 've marked up there that 's the stock Bank sets and the flood gates that 's the location flood gates so the river comes down other side of the stop things then you suddenly see we 've got the Brooklands lagoon which goes down to the right the Brooklands lagoon does not have any stop banks at all and immediately to the right of it is the waymaker really month so when you actually have a very high tide of which we get in continual tides 2.7 times we 've got three predicted world three times they 're going to happen June July August the river cannot exit the mouth when the tide is 2.7 and it has nowhere to go except on the Brooklands lagoon recently it flooded the photograph section and it 's actually very interesting looking at there the next one push the wrapping and dust to say um eh this was taken off a Nikken map and it actually shows the Brooklands lagoon I couldn 't raise it up to be bigger but it actually shows the Brooklands were doing was an history here here you can see it 's in history the use of the proving ground they 're coming around their curves around their still then in 1840 the of these areas here where the ymax had wandered all over the place including through carp we planning to acquire from flooding through christchurch and if then went straight and this became a lagoon this is an 18 I think this is a 1987 map it 's the last one they did then in in May 2017 the this is where the lagoon because it had 2.7 tired the first 2.7 tired we 've had actually overflowed done to earn the street that 's all flooding down from the lagoon straight down in the street and the council pumped there for about five days then our art painting you 've come to the end of the five minutes and and I 'm actually just wondering whether I mean it 's quite a substantial submission that you 've got here I 'm just well I 'm trying to I know it 's a submission it 's a very scary submission he so knows that the LTP process as of five minutes of mission okay when I don 't know where the story is to do we take it to camera or flooding because we 're very aware of the risks that we have I don 't care aware of what 's actually happening out there with the waymaker eerie if you have there 's another in can is responsible for the wire my career he 's responsible for the Stokes River and I understand that the the complexity of this environment but I was actually going to suggest that maybe the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee could take the submission and and perhaps even just have a you know I 'm looking to you Pauline for some guidance here in terms of maybe getting a small group together because that you have a relationship with he can on some of these catchment issues I mean it 's such a multi-faceted area with so many issues with this fearing looking for an answer here but it might be worth referring into the working group there is a quite distinct we see there are issues that transpose between the ek and the city as he can on your working party well would it be worthwhile having getting a group I 'm just trying process isn 't going to come to a conclusion so issues that he can have control over as well there is a need for us to recognize issues with the sticks in a bit of fashion and for a joint consideration of issues where the Waimakariri is concerned particularly with exposure to flooding in the Spencer Park camping ground and and potentially I 'm gonna find a solution for how we progress this penny but I think what we 'll try and do is to get David 's committee to take a bit of a leadership role peps connecting and with without a Z Committee and then bringing Akeem into the picture because it 's not a it 's not a it 's not a matter that 's sitting in front of councilors for five minutes that 's not going to be resolved so I 'd much rather find a mechanism for resolution and there have been a number of submissions on the sticks River and I think we 're just going to have to take those to a different environment to actually get some work done on them and come and give us as well yeah but I 'm just thinking the Styx River might need to be it 's that working group might need to be involved as well but look we 'll find a mechanism and we 'll let you know what the mechanism is penny so I have actually through this you will actually see that and a sinking very rapid spin spinning convening this the submission process is not the right process for you to progress that issue so it 's a mistake yes it 's not the right process for you to be progressing there so it 's not going to we 're not going to sit around the table and resolve any of the issues today or as part of the long-term plan process on the budget Arrangements we actually do need to have some something a lot more detailed that 's that is enabling of us to consider what is the right approach to take so and that does require it can to be at the table as well so I 'm just going to bring things to an end here penny that you 've put into the submission presumably we had the full submission but but what you presented today we didn 't have as part of the submission we now have the fact that the customs that the horse will render for the steps are all different ways a lot of information we didn 't have your submission you have now provided it yeah and you provided the submission I 'm just saying the submission that you put up on the screen is the first time that we 've seen it you net we now have it and the staff will make sure that it 's put on our hub so that we can actually read through it but we will find a mechanism for the way the forward from here I think thank you no I 'm sorry penny it 's it 's not fear on other submitters who have come to make their submission Thank You Julie _"

    "text": "you know beacon of Neighborhood Association good morning how are you Peter you haven 't been well here you come much better thank you and my wife 's much better too she had a hip replacement operation and she 's doing fabulously excellent very welcome it 's just the mic yes all live that 's ready to go thank you thank you very much I 've been involved in in consultations about city council plans for something like 20 years and your introduction came across as refreshingly different from the usual piece of well-crafted bureaucratic boilerplate and we hope maybe that 's because I wrote it myself and we hope that the very positive note you struck and your appeal for dialog and for meaningful partnership will meet with a positive response as we indicated in our original submission we see the serious conversation that you sought as something that will need to be ongoing and not just limited to annual or long-term plan consultations we 're all in this together it 's a very excellent theme but if it 's to have real meaning then we all need to I 'll have a bit more to say about that later on Finance we hope that now that the government 's made good on its election campaign promises of a 300 million dollar capital fund for Christchurch the degree of constraint would have been eased to some extent though obviously the need for a balancing act will continue we would like to reiterate our broad support for the the kind of balance that the council has sought to strike in the plan that being said we 'd like to clarify our position as far as the proposed spending on attracting events to Christchurch is concerned we 're not categorically opposed to the council seeking to do this which maybe have been an impression you got from our original submission but we would urge particular caution against what may be perceived as opportunistic impulse buying or as a bid to distract public attention from critical civic civic issues it 's an area where the sums involved may be relatively small but the optical impact can be huge and you may recall that it was the purchase of ellis lee flash that as regards the idea of a future fuel tax we would observe that fuel prices are and will foreseeably remain a particularly sensitive issue so when the Christchurch when the council is looking for a more creative approach to two sources of finance it will be worth giving the auckland experience with fuel tax very careful study to see what if any unforeseen problems and unintended consequences may eventuate turning to water in our Beckenham suburb we have five overflow outlets in our loop of the Heathcott River and our neighbourhood is very susceptible to flooding and to the polluting effects of emergency overflows in heavy rainfall events we want to emphasise the reservations we have regarding the idea of a shift from incidence based to effects based emergency overflow consent conditions which was raised in discussions last year last year discounting clearly measurable overflow incidents as a basis for consent conditions in favor of more debatable ecological considerations can look like a device to render prosecution for consent infringement more problematical and in in effect enabled the council to get away with more pollution than it would otherwise be the main motive for it but it seems like part of it for residents whose homes are threatened with inundation by polluted water at times of flooding the frequency of overflows is a most immediate concern rather than more general and comparatively remote considerations of environmental impact so we would urge the council to stick with incidents pasted based criteria as the principal yardstick for any future applications for overflow consent we very much welcomed your commitment to make chlorination of our hitherto pristine water supply temporary but we do hope that the degree of chlorination can be improved to achieve more palatable results we are concerned that the current Emperor the chlorination however temporary may be seized on politically by those who have an interest in doing so as a reason as a grounds for a lacks a more lacks enforcement of agricultural pollution restrictions turning to parks and heritage we 're still mystified as to why a certain amount of funding has been put in for the mid Heathcott linear park master plan for the next few years but nothing beyond 20 21 20 22 to 21 and 're sorry that the council has is proposing to defer repair of the Canterbury provincial council buildings until 10 but we can understand why that is in the meantime please please make sure that the fabric of those buildings is properly protected because we 've seen a dreadful example of what happens to a building if it 's not properly protected in the Cathedral where supportive of the proposed expenditure on repairs and improvements to the roading Network but again we would like to be confident that road repairs are real road repairs and address any issues and in the the roadbed are not just sort of superficial tarmac sticking plasters we are very supportive of the council 's encouragement for use of Road track of public transport and cycling and as we 've said to each end already we think public transport will be better coordinated if it were the sole responsibility of the City Council we 're more confident in the city council 's readiness to be responsive to public community needs than we are in that of eating again looking at the South Christchurch library service center to defer expenditure on repairs for a few more years but again we would hope that the council will monitor the the state of the building regularly and frequently and be ready to intervene if anything happens that requires intervention last almost lastly we 're pleased to see the stated aim of in of achieving improvement in participation in democratic processes and also the the goal of active participation in civic life which was part of the community outcomes part of the plan we see that as expressing a goal that extends beyond the confines of formal democratic processes and it links back to what you said in your introduction about you know conversation with with residents and and dialogue the figures given in the LTP suggests that quite a lot more needs to be done in this whole area and it can happen at the grassroots as well and in that regard we 'd like to single out the efforts of our sprayed and Kashmir community board and of its predecessor the spreadin hazard Community Board thanks to very much to councillors clear water and Scandrick which frequently puts to participate in discussing community and civic issues more broadly we hope that when the time comes the City Council will play a part in determining the composition of the future democratic environment Canterbury if the the pre 2010 procedures for determining that are followed in conclusion we 're very welcoming of the the spirit of dialogue and partnership that you expressed in your introduction it seems to us to strike a new note in the relationship between council and frustrates residents we welcome your invitation to a serious conversation about what the council prioritizes and we stand ready to do our bit as a participant and partner in what we trust will be ongoing dialogue and the fresh approach shown by the new rebuild minister further encourages us in the expectation that council and government will work together in a more harmonious and fruitful partnership than was possible under the previous regime so broadly we think the draft LTP strikes of a reasonable balance as the basis for addressing the many challenges that lie ahead thank you madam mayor Qin mo I 'm thank you very much for your behalf of the speaking of Neighborhood Association so thank you very much for presenting to us today thank you _"

    "text": "banks furniture Community Development Group welcome Marcus opportunity I 'm gonna read from some notes it 's perfectly acceptable as long as it 's not the submission you 've already seen it was we 've read it and now it 's over to you okay yeah no don 't apologize or anything so picture of being initially just in case you need reminding we are part of the city and so Christchurch is a city opportunity for all open to new ideas new people new ways of doing things the city where anything is possible sound familiar yep so without further and prompting thanks for this opportunity and and I hope you 'll be interested in what I 'm going to cover for a start or haven 't come asking for money I 'm here to suggest simple ways the council can save money on the peninsula we 're not talking about the peninsula I 'm referring to a Corolla Akane 's Bay Laban 's Little River so that out of peninsular not the Littleton basin which is a little bit more populated so on try and use their council particular the sustainable use of resources they are energy is used efficiently with a greater proportion of renewable sources water is used efficiently each person in organizations which towards zero waste and we transition to be a low-carbon City will been championed the following ideas for years but with little traction so here agog in let us manage ourselves and use locally based business and groups to carry out council tasks we do not need city care Delta or downer to emptier bins clean our toilets and mow our lawns or prune roses and the memorial gardens or to monitor freedom camping issue we 're a resourceful Bunch and they have skills to manage a lot of the council 's smaller contracts you see my little button here so I 'm I 'm a small business owner from like you devalue Little River I represent Banks Peninsula Community Development Group and would like to suggest simple ways in which the council can save money I apologize that we don 't have laws or flesh to flesh PowerPoint presentations anything like that projects we 're developing include locally based counsel contractors Highway 75 and hope to trial composting lose and the remote Bay 's of the peninsula we 've asked for strengthening community funding to look at feasibility funding for that we also run a boutique music events on the peninsula over 1,000 supporters signed a petition to lower the speed through Little River 250 kilometres the community board endorsed this but had to stand down under NZTA advice or was it bullying did you know the ins ETA do not take community 's wishes into account when speed limits are set they asked the police trucking unions in the ia but not the residents of the community so we had over a thousand people saw in asking for 50k and has been dropped to 60 we would still like to see it dropped to 50 totally worth here on this one we 've been lobbying the NZTA for signs and passing lanes on highway 75 fatal crashes have been from frustrated drivers making risky decisions I don 't know if any of you go out try to get out to the peninsula on a weekend those camper vans and guys the accident I believe have been occurring so we know I spoke to nzt about NZTA about the traffic behind you please pull over signs their immediate response was they don 't work and this is they 're all over the country now so I believe that with what I would like is can the council put some pressure on NZTA to do something about safety on Highway 75 can I just interrupt and just say you must submit off is it too late to submit on the but the the the new national policy statement has prioritized safety so there is going to be a huge change in terms of NZTA priorities from here on earth yeah because I think safety is about the fourth priority but it 's number one now that 's gross it 's change it 's a new government and a new gr GPS yeah MPs Council could look into this because we 've submitted honor we 've simply totally agree that that priority is right yeah great yep okay thank you very much so this is another net of the peninsula sorry about the on file so I don 't know if you so this is relates to the sustainable use of resources you say a growing population will put strain on our natural resources as as vital that we ensure resources are used efficiently and sustainably for future generations a sustainability focus will allow us to begin transitioning Christchurch to a low-carbon City if you want to be carbon neutral by 2030 there is a lot to do so did you know echo is a round trip of at least three hours and 160 K I 've done well guest that at a minimum for council staff this is 20 an hour and ten cents okay so to just get to the Little River at the very least is 75 and that could be to change a light bulb or move the sign or something like that so it 's only a few more kilometers to Ashburton into an active community member counted over 30 counts of related vehicles passing through Little River and a day it is almost a hundred kilometers to Laban 's Bay Beach so that 's a long way a rubbish bin when these people in those areas that could do it for you so what we would like is some support advice and guidance giving us support advice and guidance will be valued but we would also think that our group members can offer the council support advice and guidance to placing community at the heart of council activity hoping that is not just a feel-good slogan we ask you to be a member of a working group that is looking at options for having likely based people look after some of the small manageable contracts the council has given to large city based contractors her expensive so as the council being fleeced by these corporates freedom campaign monitoring in 2016 costs eighty thousand dollars for a 20-hour in three month contract that works out to over two hundred dollars an hour it 's three hours to get to a Corolla or Laban 's Bay to check someone to see if their freedom can be informed I 'm a guard to do that so if you have locals that are taking on these these jobs that 's going year Folden Hogan made a hundred and seventy six million dollars profit to Shane that 's not City Kia and it has been our rates that have helped them make these huge pop it 's good for some but not for most emptying the bins cleaning the loos at the crafts station and Little River could be contracted to the railway station trust saving the counts of money and giving much-needed funds to a local group right so we 're one of the jewels in the crown I know that the Botanic Gardens is the most sort of ticked or most popular on TripAdvisor destination bents peninsula is the second so there is a lot to do out there in regards to visitors to banks Mitchell er a Corral could have been said to save the tourist economy by hosting the cruise ships money needs to be spent on the wharf and surrounding areas as you have been asked if it was carried out by locals the savings should be substantial with travel likely to be more expensive than unsustainable new transport options need to be considered if the council 'll need to think about as you can have not included the peninsula and their transport strategy currently there is no public transport to the out of peninsular rebus visits a crow every day bringing mostly tourists and yet there is no discount for locals it costs over 25 one-way empty seats could be filled in council business supported so this is magnet Bay one of the the remote days are over in the area I 'm talking about you will have heard from several peninsular groups and their grads to the gypsy camp and air koroa but the council need to understand the issue of freedom camping is not only in the town you need to talk to more than your compliance officers for advice please engage with stakeholders with experience knowledge to discuss how to manage tourists over the next 10 years because it 's only going to get worse and at the moment a lot of locals get frustrated potentially by them being on the road parking in front of their buildings I won 't go too much into it but to the I 'm suggesting to or pray for freedom camping sites with locals being able to still freedom camp in those areas without a charge wise that the rental companies take all the fees but take none of the responsibility I suggest different rules apply to beit 's Peninsula as the council 's jewel in the crown the law states that restrictions to camping can be made for protecting an area and banks furniture than these protection from fire waste and overcrowding protecting the health and safety of people who may visit the area and protecting access to the area so this relates to the water used efficiently the southern bays are some of the most remote but popular hidden bays none of them have toilets and we 'd like to trial a composting toilet and tumbledown day then magnet the council has budgeted over a hundred and thirty thousand for a new toilet unit Airport levy with no guarantee it will be fit for purpose the one in pigeon Bay they had to turn the water off because campers were using it to wash clothes the cichlid tank filled up had to be emptied thousand dollar Lu if not more so what I 'm suggesting is you could save 150-gram by scraping their toilet over there or you could build a new unit and speed a fraction of the cost by developing something that is sustainable cheap and innovative I 'm talking about composting toilets it has not been even considered in yet we have one of the country 's best wastewater engineers Andrew Dacres based here who does this sort of stuff all over the Pacific Islands and that so that 's something that I think beat the cheap solution it 's in relation to that report that got done with the Peninsular toilets where all of them won 't have to speak and had to be closed or massive amounts be brought up to speak so this is a trial and then if that works it 's going to be something that the peninsula could be known for not the best I can to Facebook no you haven 't_''_734.67 got any time here this is one of the boutique events that we do on the peninsula the drunk festival and this is yeah for our future generations there is a lake that this is one point I do need to make this 200,000 the council has committed to pay for the bridge over buidlings flat the money there is going to be used for that has actually been tagged in an endowment fund that is for drainage of the lake not access so if that was used there 's been a people in buildings flat that have questioned the council about this and being shut down through professional privilege so there Heather look into it 2,000 was in a fund for drainage this isn 't drainage and the guy that has been pursuing this has had no traction at all it 's taken it to the Ombudsman and they 've gone the council 's professional privilege has shuttin down so these two that 200,000 the Adept shouldn 't be used for this and that and like a deli and they want to be wearing a nice photo though they do much for you time think thank you very much Marcus it 's much appreciated thank you it 's always a headache to follow but Peter tuffly _"

    "text": "the Art Center Aaron Jackson and Jane perfect welcome back Jay Ducote oh good morning hearing that counselors we 've also got obviously Jane here and Olivia Edgerton who 's our programs and partnerships manager for the at center and it 's a privilege to be here today on behalf of the Arts Center Trust Board it 's been wonderful to see so many of you over the past couple years as we 've opened buildings and that 's a privilege to be here today so as you all know we are an independent Charitable Trusts instead of in 1978 for the people of Christchurch and Canterbury in order to facilitate promote foster interest and involvement in arts culture in education and our vision is to be a hub for creative entrepreneurs as you know that we 've got 23 buildings on site and we are over halfway in terms of the restoration program we 've opened 11 we 've got two more opening this year and we 've still got 10 more buildings to go so we 're very much just over that halfway point but so a bit as a Heritage Site we are a whole city block and we 're really conscious in the environment that we 're talking about Christchurch has lost close to 50 percent of its heritage buildings within the central city which means that out of the retained here today brick in the central city we 're about 15 percent Evette so we 're talking about a large site and I guess our ask to us councillors is to really make sure that we 're continuing to support heritage across the city because we see it is incredibly important not just for the value of that heritage fabric because whatever it allows us to do as the city in as a community and we can see that from what we 've done within the restoration that we 're seeing on the Art Centre at the moment so in terms of it whole city blight and block the 23 buildings we 're at the point where we 're looking at the fact that we 've got all of these amazing videos we thought we 'd do some pictures for you because we know that of submissions but to look at some of the progress that we 've made but then also to look at some of the work that has to go so there 's some of the work that you 're seeing on the slides today as the work that 's one you know national and international awards and recognition for that work that 's been done which is the largest neo-gothic collection of buildings of the kind in the country and one of the largest stone masonry projects restoration projects in the world so in terms of how we 're going and where we 're at at the moment we 're really proud of the fact that last year and 2017 we had more than 500,000 people through the site which when you think about the fact that 's still only half the site we think is pretty great last month we have 40,000 people through the boys hide building alone so people are coming back they 're engaging they 're loving what they 're doing and they 're loving to see our tenants and engaging with the site as well as included some of the the great activities and we 've seen you at events but there 's lots of amazing things happening on the site itself but then we sit back and we look at what 's actually I guess the wider picture or not that 's obviously the long-term plan and what we 're seeing for the city we would say that heritage is absolutely essential and when we look at the number of 697 thousand dollars proposed in terms of heritage generally we would ask you to reconsider that and to look at how we can support the activation of more heritage sites because we don 't think this is a zero-sum game this is about all of us that have the ownership or the guardianship of heritage to look to how we can activate and restore these sites given that we have lost so much so we see that you know we contribute to all of you desired community outcomes in terms of livable cities strong communities you know prosperous economy the things that we 're supporting and activating within where we are and we see as now but when we look to the long-term future and when we look to the future and it you know most of you came through the Great Hall opening in 2016 you know the emotion was palpable as people who had set exams who had got married who had you know this is that 's the level of ownership that the community feels over the site that we 're talking about and we want to find a way to make sure that we can do the best possible job during this for the future and delivering on those community outcomes and that we see as being so important and so in line with what with what you 're looking to do so at the moment on current investment the Christchurch City Council supports it works out to be 4 40 per year per rate payer so less than 20% per rate payer per building and what we really want to emphasize is for us this is a really big job and the sense that every dollar that you give us which we 're so grateful for and we know it other doors but we have to find 50 for every dollar that you support so we 're at the point where we were able to obviously take a cash settlement and get on with the job which has enabled us to be where we are today which is exceptional but we 've still got a long way to go and we 're asking for your support to help us get there so for us from our perspective if we had more support which looks at that yet the value of 6 29 per ratepayer rate paper yeah and person per week here we go but in terms of what that means for us in terms of increasing that amount to the 500,000 a year rather than 350 that spread across ten years would be absolutely phenomenal for the app Center to be able to finish the job and move forward from where we are today we 're currently at the position where we 've been quietly getting on and restoring the site which is that entire city block but we really would love the support of the crash if City get on and finish the job thank you thank you Yani thank you very much Aaron because I think your presentations really timely my air concern about the the Heritage funding is that that figure doesn 't include money for the landmark phone which we had previously tuned so it is pertinent I just want to ask you I clearly and what the Art Center you 've done at building by building and step by step and it 's admirable and there 's a lot of use happening now would you like to tell us preps though about your what you 'd like to happen for example with the planned observatory absolutely so we 've got obviously some really exciting projects that are coming on and I guess for us today is an opportunity to talk about there versus the more semantics but the exciting things about the work that 's happening with that the observatory is going to be preserved we 're working with a very good project but we 're on the way to signing with on that and then we 've got the and just in terms will be kicking off in the next couple of months it 's a ten million dollar campaign and at the moment we 're working hard to see how we can secure some serious funders behind that we 've done quite a large feasibility study that we 're closing off at the moment that 's interviewed a number of key stakeholders and the city the country and internationally in terms of where the appetite us for finding that 10 million dollars so that will include two large educational spaces and of course the telescope which has been worked on as we speak Jonnie enough this time Dion a lot of people have come to us during the LTP and said that we should consider getting Selwyn and why met in the region supporting like the stadium when I think of the old Canterbury University thing the Art Center have you approached other territorial authorities to contribute or thought about maybe having a regional rate about like the museum levy that would I guess give you an ongoing kind of mechanism for funding across a wider group of people there 's a could look like and in that specific ideas hasn 't_''_554.81 been in the mix I will take your idea important thank you very much thinking of the presentation this is more I just want to say something that around the towns in telescope you know it 's really great that the Art Center 's bring in a lot of people who are passionate about you know heritage and what was the city and I just wanted to say that Graham crucial who was who 's done a lot of work with the telescope suddenly passed away 24 hours ago so I just wanted to say you know thank you to the workmen he has done and recognized work that he 's done and hopefully there 's legacy on what he 's been trying to achieve will continue so when winds that did give a timeframe for it to be reopened you know the the telescope to be available for use it 's within the next couple of years hopefully among the rest of the year and early into next year will secure enough funding to the fundraising plans and move in terms of sort of tuning off that you know the stone so ideally and we 'll be peddling quite hard in the next six months to get there yeah well our resident social media expert here to my right well we 'll post accordingly on Facebook and that may assist you in your fundraising campaign thank you very much thank you _"

    "text": "one could be councilors take these seats thank you and could I invite Kieran Sutherland sudden them quarter to come forward thank you good morning should be on green thanks for your time I 've met a few of you around the table I 'm Kieran I 'm the chairperson of the Sydenham quarter for those that don 't know for the Sydenham quarter are we we represent community and business interests within obviously the community of Sydney and I 've just got a couple of quick points really today that we wanted to present on and our submission wasn 't too long hopefully not too tedious to read through so just skipping on to the next slide do I control it here or yeah cool so the two things that we wanted to talk about was just buck and pack for those that don 't know buck and Park is a small park which is just a block off Colombo Street I believe a few years ago there was a land swap deal that was talked about and never progressed because of a couple of them building owners within forward and just want to talk about the funding of that and the timing of it and secondly just around four for one Colombo Street which is currently it 's just a little small transitional Park next to a new commercial building on Colombo Street and it 's just seeing if we can get that converted into being a permanent park and becoming part of that sort of maintenance structure that the council normally runs so last week I just popped in to buck and Pat those berries are clear enough and just took a couple quick photos as you see there 's a swing set there with no swings on it and one merry-go-round so not not much of a playground at the moment it 's looking a bit bigger than what it was it was used to be feel the overgrown and things but it seems we 've being maintained now which is great it 's basically used by the community at this stage people go there and eat lunch and sit there and you know on the landscapers it 's not a lot of green space and in November we did a neighborhood week barbecue on Colombo Street with a bit of funding obviously through the neighborhood scheme and and we face the greatest survey with people in the community just we 're there we 're of back in park and there was actually some a lot of people that weren 't so potentially some more signage around that might be part of the whole process of development and also just those that did respond it was having a proper playground more seating there 's not a lot of seating in the park either and they were sort of the two key things that came came through there so the key things are there in the last long-term plan there was about two hundred and ten thousand dollars of funding which was scheduled for this financial year or 2019 financial year that 's been pushed out to 2021 year and it 's up to two hundred and sixty one thousand now completely understand I read an article with the unquoted on the working that most people come here wanting more money and wanting more money now um 's there for funding it as well to sixty one thousand for quite a small park seems like a lot of money and we 'd like to go through a process actually understand how that was comprised I suppose but also look at me can we can we bring that back a bit and create a park on a much tighter budget than there it 's sink turn I can completely understand why there 's pushed out because 261,000 for a small park seems like a lot of money to me this is something that we 're particularly suggesting is that we could run a project as a community organization with just a little bit of seed funding that either something through with the design students at ARA or engaging with the landscape architect or a combination of the both there 's probably a likely outcome and running a small-scale sort of shear an idea scheme to see what what we could create and then be able to get that priced up and things and see whether we can cut that budget back significantly and get some movement on the 's whether we can get a small amount of funding to be able to run that scheme and then potentially putting something in for the following year we 're you know whether that 's that 's managing it all through council but we look to do the renovations to the part but hopefully on a much smaller scale than two hundred and sixty one thousand and obviously I don 't have any numbers around next we need the process to be done and and just on the path obviously is the community as it stands now he 's also the community as it 's going to be probably in 12 months time with those flexures apartments that are going in on the corner of Colombo and ROM there 's gonna be a lot of community new residents really there 's not a lot of residents to start a comic strip but there will be a bunch more and you know my understanding with those apartments we had marked all along to a function we had last month because they are sort of targeting some of those young families and that like a nice green space crabs go hang out and so that 's just something to add to why we want to get back in Park done and then lastly just on portal 1 Colombo so it 's currently just a transitional Park so we 're just requesting that if we can move that into sort of the permanent part sort of structure so that it 's just maintained and looked after as it as it should be as opposed to being part of the transitional scheme so that 's a no funding or anything be for that one apart from the usual maintenance of being a part yeah my questions were do we own the four-for-one Colombo it 's a council right okay and my second question is could you run share an idea for wolf and park as well at the same time it 's a good way to get stuff done yeah give the community interest into an economy well we hit a semester just before from the Community College there and they sort of said that they would be really happy to work with you know lions or something like that so there 's no reason why why you know a good idea and I love the idea of engaging the ARA landscape students and the process so but anyway this Phil will you hit a question Kieran thank you very much and also for the work that the pseudonym court are doing and contributing to the the business area and I just wondered if in terms of especially say for for one but also back in park if a group like for example get fuller we 're also to be involved if there could be a partnership with council in yourselves there may be some other groups and get in pretty good flow yeah I mean sure we would look at anything really like I think anything to Connor correct a core outcome in the community would be great yeah and get fellow have been proven to do that and the CBD so there 's no reason why I said in the project couldn 't be a good thing for them to make yeah that 's a good idea thinking of item I 'm just 've got the great big gum yeah the wall on the left yeah I would lose someone 's to get that and sculptures and and one still at 41 it would just be so amazing if you know when we do does the street at yeah it jumped out at me exactly yeah exactly your book jumped away when I was in the park the other day you know would be finding out it 's the RICO building but whoever owns it and just getting their permission to be able to do something on the side of their yeah I mean it 's just a big concrete wall it would look great with some artwork on yeah yeah like that I mean that could be some cool stuff that could come up through the sort of process of engaging someone or a group of students and sort of show them that blank canvas and say well what can we do with this yeah yeah they 'll be great very good well thank you very much and it 's it 's really great that you 've put so much effort into two areas where we could make a relatively large difference with the relatively small contributions they thank you very much yeah _"

    "text": "even 11 o 'clock so butter here which is the quail island ecological restoration trust so in McLennan would you like to come forward now thank you and then we 'll have a break just following on from ladies supporting the wall from the playground there 's a special suburb we had the privilege of having children from school last year and it 's the inspirational teacher it 's just wonderful to see that quality of some of these teachers and lower decile schools and it was a real eye-opener for me in that school less than 10 kilometers away from Littleton these kids have been through the tunnel just seeing a facility like Ryland being accessible to children like that just it 's just wonderful and our trust will be continuing in the future to emphasize the education aspect of the island as those please start to grow people see it people come and so 2018 there 's quite a special year for the trust it 's 20 years since we started planting on the island and eradicating the pearsons so you would have all heard about predator-free 2050 we 've got rid of all the mammalian Pierce all the animals will eat the insects and the boutiques and that 's if there 's a islands like territory martini and a lot of publicity about being predatory but we 'd like to raise the profile that we 've got a equivalent in lyttelton harbour and so we 're very successful and very very proud of what we 've achieved and I 'd like to quote dr. David Bergen who came to the island on behalf of trees that count to some planting that we have before them and he said that this would be one of the best native forestry restoration programs I aversives in terms of weed control post planting maintenance with well organised community input and realistic expectations so one of the problems we have with that success is that a lot of the funding out there is for history education and weed eradication so we 've already been through that process so trying to get funding to maintain the pest free status of the island is a bit of a battle for us so we have fantastic thing to have because it gives us a guaranteed 8,000 grant every year and the LTP process is the mechanism for coming to the council to get that revised if possible and the benefits of that of a pest free Island it means that we 've got food self colonizing and an increased by died biodiversity even six and lizards now one of the important birds we hear there 's the white flipper penguin these birds are endemic to banks crunch other and these fewer than four thousand left in the wild and their colony because of the piers relocation has grown from zero to a peak of 41 nests in 2007 so 41 nests is equivalent to around 160 birds and on quail island are safe from pests also safe from dogs and they 're safe from cars now we also have some nationally endangered plants growing on the island notably cooks scurvy grants so as I said territory martini is cited as an example of what quail island could become and it 's one of Auckland 's top tourist attractions and potentially quail island in the future to Christchurch it 's a long term process for only 20 years into it but it 's going to be probably 200 years before the forest reaches a simile of what was there originally it 's noted in our submission we 're in position and that we 're operating on land on a dock recreation Reserve but we are doing work otherwise not be doing so we think this is a this project is a big asset to Christchurch and we hope that the City Council will continue to support us thank you thank you know which which penguin were you talking about because it 's not in your submission are you breathing theme um on the island no they are naturally occurring because we are providing the printer printer to free Island what percentage of that 4,000 population would be based at Clara Island we peaked in 2007 with around 160 birds but the numbers have been slowly decreasing since then as they have been Jonnie thank you and thank you for the wonderful work that you 're doing um I just noted that doc wasn 't really mentioned you talked about that a little bit because yeah they don 't give you any funding obviously there 's been a change of government and it probably increased to their budget yes how that relationship but we also have an MoU with conservation and so anything we do on the island they maintain the trix maintain the sewage system and they give us use of bike on the tractor but apart from that we don 't get in terms of the planting in maintaining the pistil education okay thank you very much for your submission I found it fascinating and I just wondered if there was anything out I 've been writing it up on Facebook while you 've been telling I just wondered if there was anything else you want to share about quiet island so we could do a complete edit for it the history side of the island most people may know that it was used as a quarantine island for animals in the early years 20th century Shackleton Scott also used quail Island is a quarantine ponies and mules and dogs that they took so it colony and quarantine so it was initially set up as a quarantine station for the sailing ships coming from the northern hemisphere ship came into the harbor if there was disease on board the yellow flag would come out and 4 in the infectious diseases in Christ change yes there 's a leadership Rick 's graveyard next winner an old sailing ship had reached the end of its useful life I 've seen lucky a link to the white flip of penguin which is epic yeah no no it 's it 's it 's regarded as the only only it 's considered to be the one and only indigenous creature unique to Canterbury [Music] recognize the name because you use the Maori name and I don 't_''_613.81 I wasn 't familiar with it so yeah thank you think he 's so much for your submission and I love quail I 'll enjoy used to go out to it quite a lot for we used to go out there on there 's a public holiday I can 't remember once a year a whole group of us used to go out so it 's just a fantastic location and the usual response we get from visitors to the Islanders I haven 't been here since I was at school yeah it has changed dramatically from a riveting festival Dust Bowl to it 's coming I think you 've encouraged a few of us to come out and have another look so thank you very much thank you alright everyone so our next submission has time for Levantine so that 's _"

so that they don 't run out onto the busy wellthen Road because there 's absolutely no fencing there and the building 's hide number two we 've got this is the park equipment it 's um it 's very artificial playground more natural material for play equipment would be more suitable some it is unsafe without fencing playground is suitable for younger children five and under older children call it boring children don 't have flats wheelchair X playground doesn 't have a flat surface for wheelchair access there 's no climbing for children over five or so as you can see there 's my little grandchildren there through lack of wanting to climb have climbed onto the play equipment and that 's because I told them to get down from timing on the walls of the taller so there 's no climbing the children there 's a quote there for quote from an eight year old saying at twelve and park I didn 't want to play there as soon as I tuned for because there 's not much to do the playground is boring and page 3 we have parked that Parkin the been hidden from welcome Road no natural shorter and open space was no shade at all only one picnic table and been overflowing with beer bottles after a Saturday night that was taken on Sunday that 's last Sunday no drinking fountain and then we go to for younger children mattresses needles and bottles have been found in the bowl older children sit in the bowl or bold to do whatever older children do and cannot be seen from the road teenagers length language can be so bad that parents have been known to cover their children 's ears and and Ian a quote from a child who uses the park Regulus is once I got hit by people being silly on scooters some kids try to climb up the walls and slip and hurt themselves it 's a very steep one child actually asked if it was a swoon empties wrinkle so now in then there 's five this is a number of children got together and put their ideas on paper about what they would like to see at the park looks pretty cool to me so many families and well with them do not have cars so this is their main go to park many families have moved into the area since the quake 2 new housing complex with very small Gardens the wealth and park does not meet the needs of the local and to have a safe Park they can walk to suitable for all ages a park where they can take their lunch and have a family outing or even a birthday party if there 's more suitable benches and shadings in the open space then older adults parents might be encouraged to meet at the park the asset of a good community Park would enhance recreation connectivity integration opportunity and ultimately social capital together I would like we are quite happy to help with the fundraising for this park for the committee that we 're formed and we don 't expect the council to it at all to do it all we would be very happy if it was brought forward and done within the next couple of years because it 's really quite urgent it 's just not fit for purpose and I love the I love the imagery that the kids have come up with we had a lot of kids important to some of the design of some of our children 's you know more children 's oriented facilities and this is what you get out of whether you 've thought of partnering with you know like rotary and different service clubs yeah I think this is this is the sort of thing that they 're always looking for is the kind of thing that they can get really hands-on and deliver so thank you Yani I was struck by your submission talking about the intensive development and then the facilities no longer being necessary and it I just wanted to ask really you think there 's a get with how we 're doing our planning that we can enable such high intensification without the facilities that go for people living in a community yeah I 've been a community worker Wilson for 22 years now and yeah it doesn 't seem to be enough because a lot of the people on low incomes renting houses don 't have cars well them as they go to place they can 't they can 't get out of the area easily they 're financially and so we got the pool which is fantastic but that 's a summertime thing so to have a park which was would be more to do you know a lot of things after-school programs and things for the children and I think there is a youth group sort of boys for gay girls Brigade at the local church there I don 't think I know there is and we collaborate all together we have yeah a little bit yeah it 's a great suburb it 's but it has the highest as I say it in the submission it 's got the highest percentage of single parents and it is changing of course since the quake with people coming in and being able to afford the first time saving tip Tim then in thank you first it to the work you guys does it 's an outstanding and it does a fantastic Sabbath no question about their Christian I hear that the the development of the in a straight which has true wealth um is it really called Martin 's new agents idea of geography it was for selling purposes I myself findell to means [Laughter] the effect was that was quite funny right next door to welcome school you 've got some Martin and heath care community board at the time with Paul McMann and I did see intamin email say what the hey you know how can this happen however it did was involved thinking about how we can make city more child-friendly and one of the ideas they here people came up with thank you very much for coming and thank you for making yeah powerful submission on behalf of the children of the area thank you very much thank you thank you um _"

    "text": "right Rob Donald thanks Blanche the trust good morning good morning coffee much you mean I recommend if you haven 't had the time to read our sibling page submission plane it 's a good read the trust is proud of what it has achieved it looks forward to what it can achieve in the future it 's looking very much the feature in that submission I assure you as I said it 's worth read Maureen McCoy trust Deputy Chair will mainly profess in the submission and so it 's supported by silky Thompson operate the slides away the trust seeks to build on what it has achieved the trust wants to strengthen its relationship with counsel through working together on a set of shared projects over the next three years and we want to extend over the ten-year period of the long-term plan the trust supports the community outcomes identified in the long-term plan and it 's just they be strengthened by recognizing firstly the outdoor recreation is a key contributor to the crisis identity a livable city high quality of life in the role that banks plan biodiversity gain and carbon sequestration on Banks Peninsula particularly want to draw to your attention it 's a treasure for the benefit of all of us in their wider cross search area as an incredible location as I 'm sure you all know creation and relaxation so I 'll just start by talking about our parks and tricks we ask you to prioritize the quality of the existing banks peninsula tracks that are there already and you have already allocated funding for this in particular we 're thinking about the period open tracks design and installation and maintenance talking about a Kurama diamonds harbor in littleton we ask you to focus on the mountain surveillance being very well used and there are parts of that particularly in women 's galley that are in very poor condition the entire app Arctica a trick that runs along the crest of thanks furniture and particularly we ask you to focus on the your the council diction which is Gibby 's past pickles hat and the there are underlying and formed legal roads focus on in relation to the heat head walk way the work that we 're doing and a collective manner we 're working on access with the new sections that are being worked on there this is the walkway that is going to eventually run from Godley we also us when you 're making landing at questions that they are strategic and that they do have multiple outcomes for access recreation as well as biodiversity speaking of biodiversity the what we really want to draw your attention to as to the support Pease free banks peninsula we can group this is a collective collaborative approach in relation to peace free we are starting with the goats and we were asking that you okay thirty five thousand in your budget which would match our investment [Music] eradication this is enough point a coming financial year but of course peace free banks furniture is not a one-year task it is long running and we before recommending that you allocate budget every year to support this in relation to visitor management we 're asking you to develop a visitor management plan for exponentially I 've just was reflecting on what was just it before need to sustainably manage a president 's on things financially we specifically are asking that you install a simple low-cost toilet in tumbledown Bay this is an area that is getting a lot of usage there is no toilet for many many kilometers it is a sensitive area and there is nothing we see that was laboratory community project solve a significant issue there was some comment just before about freedom camping we also believe the greater management is required and in our view temping should be permitted and managed campgrounds only the fourth point to make is around policy and we ask you to develop policy on the following areas and we 're happy to engage with you of course on us the management of unformed legal roads there are many meaning recycling and we would also ask for an ability restriction of motorized vehicles we 're particularly interested in walking in cycling and we would like clarity around access we support the concept of roads of natural significance there are many roads on beats furniture that yes they were there for vehicles but in fact they there is recreation and those remote roads to be supported that way more about that in our sub machine we 're aware that the Toyota and Misty Peaks reserves Council is comprised of the regional parts on the peninsula but we have not seen a resume management plan for either of those reserves so we recommend the de management plan be developed in budget be allocated access onto both of those areas as relatively restricted and so a management plan would be extremely useful there and finally our last point in relation to this is that we ask you to manage all of the parks and the tricks and the reserves on banks peninsula with a strengthened regional parks team at the moment some of it is done by the urban parks teams some of it is done by the regional team it 's actually inefficient we believe in you could gain much greater efficiency and our experience at all being done by the regional parks and with an enhanced team because there has been a proposal for some time they dedicated to exponential AB a stranger B be engaged em we the various stakeholders the trust has operated very effectively with mr use for once organization and with other NGOs in this field as well as we think it 's a a great way to do business a great way to get effective outcomes by having relationships structures such as that we we 're basically seeking a similar situation with Council we have the statement of intent as we know as you know but we think that it 's not an effective vehicle for getting cooperation between counsel and the NCC oh the the trust so we 're seeking we were willing to hold discussions at a governance the senior management level on collaborative projects that can be worked over the coming years and anymore you can assist in that respect the trusts have also like to discuss its role and work over the next 10 years apply for the LTP we had anticipated lasting only probably another five years but we think it 's more important that the work of the trust continue beyond that and develop shared projects inclusion and the next LTP getting ahead of ourselves basically the of working with Council it 's on a collaborative basis great shared goals we see the trust playing a significant role for the next three years and beyond we think we 're the if the long haul not suddenly for the period that the funding lasts thank you thank you very much I was particularly interested in the unformed legal roads not forming part of the regional infrastructure so it 's something I 've taken a note off so thank you for raising me does anyone have any questions though thank you very much for your very full submission you put it point out some of the contradictions too when the targets and the service pains fortrex and end also what what that there 's no further funding proposed just wonder if you might comment on it I 've got another little question I think one of the things that when we 've been thinking about all this is that the collaborative approach is something that would really help the council to achieve that aim of increasing the quantity we 're just gonna come around and give you all a and also the tower pot likker brochure so what we 've done in the book is we 've pulled together all the tracks that are on banks parents you know regardless of what agency actually owns the underlying land and you will see that actually there 's a lot of resource out there both in terms of reserves and in terms of tracks and telepathic areas as our collaboration with Department of Conservation so we 've done a joint brochure together here and we think maybe the way forward to help you achieve those excellent targets that you 've got in the long-term plan is to work with the trust as a sort of middleman as it were to bring collaboration between all the different groups and then start counting the whole resource because from a user perspective it doesn 't really matter whether it 's the council that owns a piece of track or darfur up a public reserve or some other sort we think that 's probably the way forward Brittany the dark seasons is a very important relationship with trust and we see someone wrong with trust that some and thank you for the booklet I think you 'll find a number of councillors encouraged to get out and explore some of the environment as a result of that so thank you very much for your season this morning one of the staff members will come in and and do that for you thank you _"

    "text": "oh please come forward I just have some jottings for myself just to add to the written submission that we made and firstly that because the complex waste disposal problems that are ongoing we see safe disposal of wastewater you know that 's not a nice to have and the Friends of banks provincial is concerned at the original budget of thirty five million dollars for a new treatment plant in Harbor discharge it has not been adjusted to reflect the options are now being explored with the volume of wastewater and now known to be twice as much as originally planned for two options remain on the table deep bore objection injection as yet the feasibility of that is not known although the costs or piping to the outer coastal area for land disposal neither option would leave any funds for establishing non potable reuse known as public pipe and arkarow this was promoted by the friends in strongly supported by the community and last year 's consultation process and our town water supply is another ongoing difficulty for Corral and increasingly vulnerable to the effects of climate change conservation encouragement and measures is really vital for the long-term sustainability and resilience of our own and we would really like to see low-tech solutions to this problem rather than increasingly high-tech in risky ones and also the burgeoning costs those so safe disposal of wastewater is actually a problem for communities across banks peninsula and funds that also needed for equally pressing problems elsewhere so we want to see the wisest possible yes there 's a lot of money for seemingly a very small rate payer base but on any given day this really brings me to our next point which is the provision of public toilets in rural areas and the council has commissioned a report about those existing facilities and they 've been found the disposal systems that many of these are failing or or a practically non-existent so there 's another huge huge cost and huge problem that we 're facing we 've got ever-increasing visitor numbers and in great public concern at the proliferation of human waste and toilet paper from public and private property now as I spoke to an official capacity last year situation those toilets been reopened a couple of months ago but since then did has two very obvious parts of toilet paper behind those toilets but it 's it 's just a huge they 've been there for several weeks now I believe the contractor comes weekly at least to service the toilets but that toilet paper has not been picked up also the contractor doesn 't all I don 't have any rubbish that 's lying around either probably not in their contract yeah that 's right and and it really ought to be because it just encourages is more of it so we just need to be but a lot more clever about how we we 've got and the topic was really it 's an associate 101 I guess of freedom campaign and we just really wanted to say that with the uncertainty and that and the high cost of both water supply and wastewater disposal and a try and the surrounding areas we we really can 't afford to be providing free use of our facilities for outside campus and a freedom campuses would be provided pay fairly for the facilities that they use and that 's the water supply the waste disposed of the rubbish disposal and also waste dumps for camp events I mean self-contained camping is not you know the way to go it still brings a lot of problems and my mother lives in a karahi neighbor has on three occasions now he 'd camp event waste Duncan who we 'd really them so this is this this is what the reality of what we 're we 're facing over here with waste disposal and you know the idea that we 're we 're some sort of demanding community that 's that that wants to gobble up lots of Christchurch 's money I mean these are not nice to haves their services that we we need to have especially adversities are going to continue to come to the area and numbers that they are so just the friends just wanted to take this opportunity to let you all turn to these very real problems that we have open about roading and thank you very this is a priority for thanks from a have lodged an application with the tourism and infrastructure fund for toilet Public Works for a Corral so specifically to cater to that demand the problem is not so much and in the town itself we there is a reticulated sea forget about what sitting at the other end of it it 's nicer earlier is we 're actually providing the disposal is extremely costly and if you 're on it close to the coast actually I 'm very difficult to do so I of course and closely looking at what 's happening at French farm since the toilets have been really yeah ok thank you um Phil thank you for your submission can I just ask you about the the corral wastewater scheme and just with reference to the Working Party so if for example future technical reports showed that in fact more than one option is required so that in fact some sort of combination of say that the deep borders within fusion and also the irrigation and storage if a combination was required is that something that the working party is open to as well I 'm friends is not I mean obviously these discussions are ongoing I think that if you have a range of systems in the cost keeps going up and also if you have a really high cost in capital for the reuse option which is it 's probably the only sustainable and I think the point of your submission as the state we haven 't budgeted sufficiently for the options that we are advocating and the plan and it doesn 't contain the reference to the potable non potable reuse option and also I guess it was also expressing concern that if all the money gets spent on a Corral what about the rest of also need money as well yeah yeah a gleam quick question here 's a public waste dumping facility and then we 'll of the town they used saying you don 't have anything at all like that for and are self-contained the I believe kuroh they have to go to the camping ground okay the one on Chevy it 's outside the camper ground so there can be used by we can check that Glen in terms course if someone 's camping over and one of the remote base for a few days yeah but we can 't have them everywhere I mean it 's just it 's we have camp event agree with you so no but we do need to we do need to think about capacity and availability of dumping facilities at strategic places so but we 'll we 'll check up on where the existing services are and whether they 're under pressure I think this is all the questions look thank you very much for coming and that is always valuable that people do come so thank you very much for raising these issues _"

    "text": "kashmir technical Football Club Caroline Mason good morning morning thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today my name is Caroline Mason I 'm the secretary of colleagues and mr. young who is the operations manager so we 'll just quickly run through how I just do I get it to change slides Oh we 'll get someone to to be here but I think you just need to press the forward thing on the yeah the arrow on there so Lucy we just we would like to acknowledge the support of counsel in various ways to our table through the strengthening communities fund and through the discretionary fund we just found out yesterday that we 'd had a grant from the spread in Kashmir and discretionary fund so we 're very grateful for the support of counsel and we do recognize that council has a range of priorities around spending our rate payers money and that we 're one of many groups that is looking for support but there are a few things that we just thought was worth bringing to your attention today so just by 're formed in 2012 through the merger of two long-standing clubs Kashmir Wanderers and Christchurch technical also known as walleston Tech we started a dialogue of merging together before the earthquakes and obviously the earthquakes did have an effect on our major process our club catchment if you like extends from right round two Linwood and Wilson and also includes Governors Bay diamond Harbor and the health suburbs we have an active plane membership of around 1400 and we have around 112 teams and that ranges in ages four to six through two over 65s we have our senior men 's and women 's team compete in the mainland Premier League 's and both in both competitions and are currently I 'm setting top of the table for the men and close to the top for the woman we have two full-time employees and Lisa is our operations manager so this next slide just illustrates our what we consider a sort of catchment area the key activities that the club is involved in pre-season we run a range of activities for our junior players mainly skill centers elite training camps and seniors and trials for Team section now those skill centers and fun camps and holiday programs are available to non-members so they 're open to the community during the season we run a player development Academy and Erin heads that and that 's about providing a pathway for our sort of keen and and competitive young players we obviously run the Saturday teams playing the mainland competitions in this midwinter training for all of those junior teams and social events price given his fundraising functions and other social events so a key as well as obviously promoting the game of football our club does provide a very important social function for our members and for the wider community the issues that we have around funding obviously were very large club but our subs don 't cover our costs so we very much appreciate that and we rely on that sort of funding to enable us to employ people like Lisa to help us run our club and one of the things that we 've highlighted in this submission is just requesting that council consider ensuring that that fund is level of support for these sorts of community-based organizations one of our key issues as facilities and grounds and this won 't be news to you but obviously in our particular part of Christchurch there is a limit to green space we are key council grounds that we use which at the moment to sent in your summer field Beckenham Barrington Hills bro all suffer from poor drainage and said of the facilities and so one of the things that we would like council to consider is just improving those grounds and facilities working with us as a club to improve those facilities for our members and for the wider community partly because of that limitation and green space we do rely heavily on privately owned grounds at Garrett Park and Whittington Avenue and we 've been responsible for raising over half a million dollars to rehabilitate both of those grounds because they fell out of the council 's sort of area because there are no council grounds that are suitable for the level of competition that we 're playing in we do rely on those grounds in order to run our player development Academy so one of the things that were asking council to look at is to work with us and those private landowners the Muslim Club in the case of Garrett Park and our probably technique in the case of mudding Tanana to work with those organizations and ourselves in terms of providing a partnership going forward to help contribute to the cost of maintaining those grounds bearing in mind that if those grants weren 't available in you know the green space one of the sort of unfortunate consequences of the earthquake was the loss of Lowood life feels to us as a playing ground obviously that 's now been acquired by the Council for stormwater retention services which is obviously a function that is incredibly important but an unfortunate consequence of that was that we lost the infrastructure that was established at that ground including flood lights and also use of the pavilion for storage purposes and unfortunately just the way that that process panned out sort of happened without any input from us so I don 't think council was even aware that we those storage facilities at our own cost by installing containers at Whittington Ave and the flood lighting infrastructure is basically lost to us at the moment so we 'd like to think we could work with Council towards finding some solutions to that recover some of that and finally I think just in terms of the future of the green space and our part of the catchment it is limited and the grounds that are there are because of the nature of a part of town poorly drained and the facilities aren 't that flash we know that mr. park is coming up consideration in terms of future use depending on the on the stadium development and we 'd like to see again that council would give some consideration to towards the future use of that ground and making it available for use for football pictures including flood lighting in changing facilities so that 's basically a rundown of and I guess the opportunity now for you to answer to ask questions it 's um term and infill thank you just recently Phil undermines the community board which just gave it the condition in the state of our parks and sporting parks in our area so part of that could be that we also include you so we give our council staff feedback but also your feedback so we get a 360-degree over not a want of a better term a true picture would it be well voice of participation survey last year and one of the key feedbacks for our club was that generally members are very satisfied with the service but the key issue was the grounds in the state of the grounds I did be open to this constructive feedback before my just a quick second one you earned the lights at the Woolston that whether the the retention basins to do you actually own those floodlights so you 've paid to put the moon etc and now you can 't use them all of the services to provide Linwood colleges changing rooms and facilities but we contributed heavily to help not just keep those up to date but we also help them with their green space as well because we in there in that part of thank you thank you thank you very much why not be quiet um so basically you 're really saying Linkous to park long term there 's something that would really help but also that short term you really want to be able have a conversation with their park staff and they especially really difficult to drain areas like the 2-pack summer field in Centennial on the City Council own green space and that 's and we understand Dean Graham 's saying let 's do a good job of maybe a couple and then we can thank you thank you very much for coming in and thank you very much for your time it does make a difference when people you know presentin and are able to answer questions so thank you very much thank you Friends of banks peninsula so if you Thompson _"

    "text": "and so could I invite CC ins it Jeremy Dixon Ford thank you we 've read all of the submissions and about all of the ones that we 're hearing today I haven 't read all of the ones not wanting to be heard yet but I will and so please just speak to your main point you 've got 10 minutes so thank you very much thanks very much Mia depending Mirren councils for hearings forgive me for reading this first we 'll get a few points across the phone original submission I 'm speaking on behalf of CC NZ where we are an industry body who stated vision is to promote a healthy civil construction sector healthy is where skilled and qualified clients clients such as a crush at City Council consultants and contractors produce outcomes that deliver value for money for all participants we achieve this through investment of people sound planning encouraging fair and consistent procurement strategies promoting a healthy healthy competition and growth opportunities for those willing to be able to take another challenge so as per a written submission the future health care industry raises for us specifically in regard to the proposed spend on infrastructure been either high medium or low as that on in the plan our industry which focuses largely on horizontal structure as well as a large employer in the canopy region estimations from in bie places around 30,000 employed for horizontal structure and over 70,000 for the wider construction industry and Canterbury this represents a significant portion of the working market in Canterbury and the majority of these in the Christchurch City propose beamed firm instruction the LTP is a significant portion of the projected future spend in the region especially for civil construction so it really worries us as per our submission CC NZ has strongly abdicates for the high level spent and I see use of had the medium level spend as Europe as you 're likely outcome not only in its interest to promote and grow a healthy civil infrastructure sector as a spend and lower median levels we have major impacts on an already tightening industry but also in the interests of spending money now to save money in the long term and operational and is effectively the city 's most important and highest value asset and that is stated in your plan hello and to a lesser extent a medium spend combined with the reduce spin from central government by NZTA effectively that is program for the Canterbury region would be catastrophic Canterbury region for the near future will be catastrophic for their industry health and o be catastrophic for the people employed within it this will mean they 'll be potentially significant negative and economic impacts for the wider community the council was faced with making decisions that unpackaged people both now and for future generations that 's what you guys are tasked with we see cnz fully understand that there is a drive to keep rates rate increases to a minimum and spare money where it is most needed and where it will provide the best bang for buck so to speak we are also aware that does not councils responsibility to keep the construction industry strong however it needs to be noted that many of the people employed in this industry and the are many our citizens of the city any families within the city we can 't ask you spend high amounts of money the height the high level without trying to understand how we can save money I mean is only so much in this part so regarding how to save costs for the right person there 's only so much to go around it 's very very hard to quantify reform if the high speed is employed is the best option it will cost more money up front however they will never be a cheaper time to construct them now as a competition expertise following the earthquakes and the mess of influx of people and skills into the region expert expertise exists whithin is sitting now to achieve the best bang for buck for the city and that 's what it 's about it 's about achieving bang for buck for the monies the dollars we got now investment now will also significantly reduced lifetime operational costs and maintenance costs as outlined in your report I think we have to resist throwing good money after bad money some of our assets also the city will have infrastructure that zealand city what aspect is only base level currently the mid and low levels spend options do not return assets to even pre youth quite levels and I think this cannot be valued in dollar terms but it must be significant increasing rates increasing debt or selling assets may be the only way to achieve the high level spend now but longer-term the costs are not many lists to do the work in the future at some point the work does need to be done it 's just a case of when and how much is willing to be wasted on maintaining inferior assets over that time the whole of life costs need to be seriously considered money should not be wasted on maintaining a furious it 's ongoing so that 's that sums it up for us thank you for hearing a submission and I 'm open to any questions yeah no thank you that 's a it 's a really good submission I 'm and I read it and but you know you 've made a really powerful point which is that there is a cost to the it is it could be in the sense that there is there are costs that come with that decision and and are you suggesting that we should look to some of our asset base and and free up some capital from there in order to just get on and get it done in a faster time frame there any questions Aaron so just on your comment that it 's never cheaper than now to build the people they have to sit around making decisions on wind things get though shouldn 't we build the new C cities now and the nice to him because we 're in a building boom isn 't that the wrong time to build shouldn 't you build during you do your big infrastructure projects during a building slam because it 's cheaper to get everything I think we are in a competitive time now I don 't think we are honor and a boom as such that the industry 's been training down for the last 12 to 18 months it 's very competitive there 's a lot of people in this working in the city NZTA spending less money the City Council 's spending this money there 's less development has been so there 's a natural writing of the market I suppose but it is very competitive out there at the moment and you are you 've been nice to haves we 're not asking for nice-to-haves this is to get the city 's level up to what 's pretty least some previous quick levels so these are our eyes and the cities and we haven 't asked for nice-to-haves let 's just get it to the city level so ya agree not nice to have should be part for what I think that the public generally had an expectation that the cost-sharing agreement on horizontal infrastructure would return us to pre-earthquake levels right across the board and of course that hasn 't been the case and thus LTP has really opened that up for public scrutiny in a way that hasn 't been clear before so yeah I 'm cookie when you said there were 30,000 people employed and horizontal infrastructure was that in Canterbury Canterbury so MBIA I 've got a so this I think it was training to about 72,000 as what they have as in the Canterbury infrastructure a silver structure market that 's vertical horizontal you know yep that would include all those consultants I 'm use but it 's also Kokoda the you know the state highway the railway you know all of their every being yeah Christchurch but brush which is a mess significant part of that region it 's a lot of families a lot of people yep well look thank you very much for your submission it 's much appreciated thank you

    "text": "um Ellis dear Hutchison welcome and I 'm here as a private citizen long time resident of and a long too long to free and really of the even death Cottage Street and the southern for short and particular I was a foundation member of the Christchurch History Association of 1971 and that association I was a foundation remember that even he 's got history who do I trust and I was on the board of the eastery trust until the coastal pathway came along and I strategically decided to move over to the pathway when the opportunity was there with the earthquake repairs to actually do something to get the pathway underway I 'd like to thank you all very much for the huge amount of time you spent on the on the 10-year planets that 's that 's incredible and I really appreciate that as a private citizen I 'd like to thank councillor Templeton in particular for their beasts efforts to get funding into the 10-year plan for more funding for the pathway my first point and I 'll just add to the points I 've made to be as direct as I can and I will continue to do that and if I look up it 's not for inspiration but to watch the clock please provide sufficient funding in the ten year plan to complete the pathway my point is that if it 's your intention for the pathway to be progressed and that 's last section within the next ten years it should be funding in the plan I 've heard an argument from staff that because we don 't have the exact exact figures for the monks by section or we couldn 't then we 'll ask for the money in three years time but that doesn 't seem to mean this with the purpose of a 10-year plan I believe even if the money has slowed down through the ten years through necessity or something that family should be allocated in the ten year period if it 's your intention to finish finish it it is a Scots either does account it is a it is a council Assiut that was initiated by a private group certainly remind you as in an money up which was quite unusual I think it was seen as a it was a post is quite recovery project and it was sold and seen and accepted I think in that light I think the money 's been very carefully spent to date not only by people by the staff who have worked on the pathway they 've been very careful to try and keep the money for the pathway and not have it used by other bits of the writing and drainage and things like that we things have come unstuck is actually quite recently and you will be aware of the protection huge port protection road port road protection project which is ETA funded much of and that was done under the specially earthquake legislation and as a result of that there was no opportunity for public submissions or comment until after the resource conceits were applied for well I was on the executive summary since Association and we put in a submission and the plans are all finalized we put in a submission and said hey you 've forgotten about the path will reinstate the do that if you just move the Agora bun back away but that 's probably given up you 've got it four metres no trouble but the problem was though to reapply for the consent there was no way that could be stopped or slowed down so I 'm just saying to you that the seawall that you 're now that you 've now just got consent for which which will but which doesn 't take me at it 's very expensive it 's the first ocean seawall the council has tried to build it 53 and it 's not to be underestimated the tide high tide is lapping against the old seagull now it 's not an easy thing about how much it 's going to cost what I 'm saying is it wasn 't here made in the rush of feeding these big projects and the sort of tunnel vision of these is quite projects and the poor thing the government wasn 't going to pay for a part say the council forgot to put one in having taken the path on the cliff side it was just probably now paying three million dollars for a seawall that shouldn 't have had to pay for we need till you do the shore protection works and ten years time for some during the road it wasn 't there was easily enough room for four meters on the seaward side so it 's not one that the coastal pathway can sort of publicly speak about but as is officially right submission for the some of the residents Association I can speak about it peace it 's just a shame that the last of the big chunk of money a few people said University gave to the pathway a large chunk of it was actually going to be thought through major engineering project which wasn 't really necessary it 's just one of those things and the money I think is probably my main point if you can 't do it straight you know if you if you need to spread it over time I understand that we do need something to stop people falling into the eastery between sharecropping the rowing club because there are three meter drops about 12 that we can look back and understand errors that were made but they are what they are and we have to do what with what we 've got what we have to do so thank you very much for your submission it 's much appreciated thank you and John _"

    "text": "christchurch coastal pathways got Bebbington good afternoon submission so I 'm Scott Benton I 'm the chair of the Christchurch coastal pathway which is your where is cooperation with the crisis it accounts from building a six and a half bath way from a bridge out to and including the Sumner s Barnard and we have a memorandum of understanding and to that effect now this is a 30 million dollar project the council very kindly and generously funded that to tune of nine point nine million five years ago which actually accrued some interest up to eleven point four but we have about five point eight million of their left in the upcoming peacock 's section 2 memorial walkway so that 's the area that goes from record near corner past on the zoo 's Club and joins up with the some news but note it some them so we 're seeking 10 to 12 million dollars on the long term plan to complete what we call the gap the gap is around monks Bay 's so if you 're familiar with the area goes from tram stop which pasture just been constructive roaring shed to repin you a corner and this is the last section to complete the pathway however without the section really it makes the rest of the pathway at least useful because we have two ends I 'm sure that the new in that 's just we have to be built from Peacocks corners going to be well used but really the benefits going to come when the whole thing is completed they 've benefits at the moment there was a big safety risk you will have seen that in both the priests and the bay have a news about the rest of the dish tunes and other users of the pathway going past the monks bays section that section facing west if you can imagine just pass the rowing club here that 's currently being built it 's very narrow had each to the pathway which is at risk in different areas and I 'm surprised that someone hasn 't fallen I 'm into the history sadly you will be a way of two accidents at that here one of which had a tragic area hit record knowing corner to prevent something similar happening again other benefits of the pathway really its benefit to locals I think it gives pace for locals to get out to teach the kids how to cycle safely to walk and avoid the environment to the visitors for those locals and both international visitors were seen more and more particularly Asian and visitors coming out and enjoying this area so I really think it has a lot of visitor attractions with being partnering with questions Eid with regard and I think that this has the benefit to complement and be equal to the patina Gardens and if you want to think of the benefits to the region also something like the coastal path way gives stickiness to visitors so by using the coastal pathway it will take you half a day for you travel from in town pets as the conference delegate or as a visitor to the city if you travel out and then decide to have a meal for example at Sumner you have been obliged to stay at the town so this has real perceivable benefits nicely with other benefit raction such as the cycle park so that might be for the more effective members of a family and then the other members perhaps with kids might go and do the cycle way so that all of the family can so I call whether visiting Christchurch so a beautiful Lincoln near we also link walking wise to the Christchurch 360 pathway we link with all the port hills and pathways it 's a great introduction to the area but if you 're not fit enough to be clamoring up the hills you 've got a nice safe at pathway all abilities this includes people with mobility impairment we have paraplegic parkways palace parking spots been installed with ramps it 's a nice hard surface suitable for wheelchairs and other mobility advised devices so it really delivers for these people as well possibly more so than any other area around Christchurch um will say this head gives us the potential to do other activities in the future we know the success of the bondi to bronte sculpture display Sydney we could do something similar out in this the Sumner to the city to suit that sort of thing could go out along there with the Sumner starter that means on the coastal pathway so the lots of events are using it already completing the pathway will enable more events to be used in Sydney we 're very keen to help run those also it delivers benefits of cleaning in the East Street the swales that have gone wrong side of the road taking and treating the storm water without runoff directly into the history this is a major benefit tonight our who enter other crisis and residence and we have been able to restore at native plantings who are using native planting along the whole six and a half kilometer route one area just opposite Red Cliffs Park is showing the attractiveness both benefiting other benefits that are coming up already people are stopping at cafes so used in the pathway and stopping off we can see with bike hire and bike repair shops happening along the pathway people choosing to stay along the pathway and boat Eco motels hotels I 'm afraid to say air B&B lots of tourism opportunities and I can see that tourism operators will also bring people out to the pathway so the funding we 're seeking at ten to twelve million dollars for completion of the month 's pay section of the pathway the reason that this is a variable number is that we don 't have a firm estimate to give to you today and it 's going to take a year also to give the detailed plan to enable the detailed queue is to actually tell us us even with all of their effort the proper price is going to be the tender price of the person that builds this section so it 's never going to be more accurately able to be predicted in confident that we can if we funded it to twelve million in Mattoon two to three million dollars of money I would think that it was a good thing to do what are we doing this the Coastal pathway committee we are seeking other forms of funding we 've applied for a substantial amount of funding for the current section that is about to hear mid-june so hopefully that will be forthcoming and potentially could and contribute Timbers into the total cost of the pathway so I am reminded with the sign behind the mere price you stopped cycle in town 2017 the Coastal pathway contributes to this let 's keep it a top cycling town and give visitors another reason to come to Christ okay Sarah thanks Scott um just to clarify the work that you 're doing is done with the council yes and so when you say we 're asking for this money it 's actually money that you won 't put on councils budget for council to do work it 's not money that 's going to another organization so this will be a cost sheet and so the team drain and the question the coastal pathway group are funding all of the extras so all of the swales all the extra plantings and different services seats water fountains crossing points over some nice Bernard all those in half I feel like a council built pathway with a community enhanced community and really I think this has been a new their previously you know look honestly it 's not fear but that 's what I 've been looking for on the map it 's a really tricky area I mean incredibly narrow it 's right up hard against a seawall which people on the other side look at jealously but if they look at the implications of Everhart up seawall they might see that it 's perhaps not always the best solution yeah thank you very much um it is a very challenging part of that particular proposal but thank you very much it is a very exciting that 's the whole the whole process is pretty exciting itself so thank you very much for what you 're doing organ thank you _"

    "text": "right now I 'm going to I 'm going to must pronounce the some name so I need some help the glue do see Nana yeah Kate [Laughter] could you help me out please it was actually just very polite of you thank you very much all right so I suppose I should start please so that like Medusa said I 'm Buddhist an ayah and I 'm here today as a citizen of Christchurch rather than any part one organization and I suppose I 'm representing myself and I also think I 'm representing what I feel is my community whatever that might be I feel part of Christchurch and I 'd love it here so um you know usually we come here and say all sorts of things they should be doing better and I will get to that but I want to start by thanking the council not just this council but actual entire operation for all the work you I have done and it 's been a difficult time and and I think I think that thanks are needed and I also want to mention that made as being part of tackling one of the biggest issues we face as a community and as a species which is climate change and it 's no secret that the science then and the scientists and the experts tell us that we should be doing more but I think you 've shown a lot of courage take at least the first steps and for that I think we should be commended so as always I will start with issue of cycleways and I think as far as long-term time you shouldn 't delay the completion cycleways they should be done on schedule as prios the plan and a great opponent and as a mandate from citizen regardless at that time they had one they should not be delayed and figures from councils own data shows that the object has been recent more people are using them and in most cases all of the motorcycle bears have been a relative success but I suppose things are going okay it isn 't really that great immediate headline so you know there is that now that 's not to say that everything and I think the biggest problem is facing the side ways in Christchurch it 's the manner that they 're being implemented it 's not that it 's not that your plan itself is the implementation so I 'm gonna I 'm gonna serve as an example I live in a Strickland Street and I use the Strickland Street antigua route goes recycling and driving into the city because I do both and like most people and the implementation of the traffic management system there is completely subpar for example initially the traffic controls just wouldn 't sense it since a bicycle so they just wait there and wave nothing happened and then you go and press the button for the pedestrian crossing and then you get across and now the the traffic controls for the cyclists are always predict so even if there 's no cyclists there they go off and the cars have to wait there 's only two lanes so the left turning traffic and right turning traffic can go everyone stuck and I 'm not you know saying just gonna fix that problem it 's just it 's true you know technology like this case or whether it 's a compromise leading to a frustratingly so I think the thing that that frustrates me the thing that makes a compound forgivable is that these aren 't unsolved problems right these are problems that have been solved elsewhere the technology for traffic solutions it 's not trivial but it 's not difficult it 's been around since the 80s so I think in assessing the successes of the proposals whatever the proposals are I think we should be including assessments against solved problems elsewhere and then you know that 's how we 're doing is that so don 't reinvent something that 's already done just move it and we need these things because we need to transition to a low-carbon future and if you want to build resilience in a city we need diversity in transport infrastructure as well as other that 's critical and so speaking of transitioning I just wanted to say that the idea for just transition is violent because of that personally I 'm strongly posted the idea of original fuel Texas that flat taxes I believe affect the most vulnerable in the poorest members of our communities the worst and it 's not fair or just that the most vulnerable and the poor people greater relative burden then those that are better off so what I would say is while it might be an effective source of revenue it 's not a just source of revenue it should be a banner in favor of something like a tiered approach based on the value of personal vehicles a road user type charge and that will also bring EVs into the fray and let 's be honest electric vehicles aren 't used by poor people at the moment and so it 's not it doesn 't make sense text for something that they can 't really help but use in terms of infrastructure investment you know the cost-benefit stuff that we talked about an impact and the benefit from the most vulnerable communities must be a standard in all cases not just in an economic sense but in terms of quality of life and infrastructure that assists and benefits multiple members of the survive the thing that we face this is this big problem we have to transition to a low-carbon future but we have to make sure that everyone comes along on the journey journey because if we survive at the cost of the most vulnerable that 's the cost that they bear then you fail that was the most perfectly timed submission that I think I 've heard well you think you gonna go spy standstill right depending on what 's there yeah thank you very much for your submission that 's much appreciated thank you and thanks for coming in on a Saturday _"

    "text": "John take up afternoon it 's lovely to see yours good I don 't want to say too much as you know I took from the top here I was looking through my little resume a on the computer before I came here and I notice I didn 't get a spelling check and there are a few words here that just weren 't quite complete but I 'm sure you would understand that anyway without further ado I just want to mention the importance of my submission is to get your priorities right I feel that we 're only a small city we only have a population of 350,000 and we 've got all these satellite towns all around us now they 're all getting their facilities they don 't need us let 's look after us look after the right players I feel that sports gone overboard I don 't think we need all these sports facilities if these people need sports facilities let them do some fundraising while I look at the counts or while look at the government it 's wrong I mean that 's what to have meat raffles quizzes you name it when we put something towards oh but are they doing any of that now I don 't think side anyway I just mentioned first off about the concentrating on basic services I mentioned that for the sole purpose that we 've had seven years of held and as you know underground services are not popular with the public because they don 't see them but when they call the chain and say oh yeah it 's not working there 's no water coming through they say oh it 's Council 's fault you know and an actual fact we 've been very fortunate with us earthquake because previous councils have neglected the underground services a lot of the pipes were terracotta and they 'd just been prepped a lot of them were not serviced for years so we 've had a mammoth job of actually getting all the surged together all the water together all the underground services together and it 's not a sort of thing that 's going to happen overnight as you all know I believe a lot of been done properly and I believe they 're using rubber joints and so on so it 's more flexible if there is another it 's quite anyway enough of that one my next my next one was about the Metro Sports Center I think it should be scaled right down why do we need several stadiums several was civil there we 're only a small city for goodness sake I 've just come back from Rome last Saturday it 's a huge place they 're looking after their infrastructure they 're looking after their old buildings and so on you can drink their water out of the tap without chlorine what I 'm really getting at is that we can 't afford all these facilities even in the 20 year plan on the 10 year plan what 's ten years and a ten year plan we can 't afford it ratepayers are stretched now and an actual fact if we have one decent Stadium that can be used multi-purpose with a roof on it everything around it will develop will get shops will get other things around it it can recently used for all sorts of things any jam going now don 't spend any more money on art installations I love art and I enjoy the art installations we 've got but you don 't think about the future of having to maintain these art things we 're already having to clean this one and clean one and do this and do that we 've got enough let 's have travelling exhibitions and so on that 's good now taking out leases on public buildings I don 't set me about the tacky but it 's been sitting there a long time empty and we 're missing out on money it 's it 's rate payers money we should be earning money and let 's look forward and have a floating restaurant and Governors Bay actually funded by the council lease it out Oregon it 'd be a boon as for reduce the can to be provincial building I noticed the wooden section is being repaired at the moment get that up and running on that on that side don 't worry about the stone one that can be secure now public transport that 's the one I 'm very hot on I live in governor 's Bay and my wife and I would like to have a bus to take us into town every now and again and a bus to little tongue we can 't do either we have to take a car sometimes I have to take two cars because my wife spoon going one direction I 'm going in the other yeah I 'm not just thinking of me by the way oh sorry but anyway I 've written it all down and writing and it 's from my heart and I 'm sure that if you 've got any questions you 'll ask me and I 've got a few ideas let 's get our underground services straight our precious water chlorine-free let 's enjoy the clean green so they looked for a great future after all the many many cities in the world have not got a second chance as we 've had a second chance thank you thank you that 's a really good note to end on I hate to disappoint can you didn 't notice the difference which is very telling indeed so thank you very much for your submission briefly I don 't my archives and I 've got three Metz ones an aeroplane view of Christchurch here are plain view so it doesn 't say what data does but it 's actually fascinating to see I better get prepared at skinnier but I just want to show you quickly I don 't hold you up I just think it 's important just to see where we 've come from and we 're we going would somebody help yeah that 's right and could somebody with their iPad take a photo of it so that you can circulate it to us great thanks Sarah for them yeah no no that 's good preserved linear getting a copy of that by the Historic Places trust and believe it or not most of the buildings are still here so we 're on a wooden situation here great thank you very much it 's a much appreciated _"

    "text": "free leverage good afternoon mayor that 's nice thank you so much for offering me this opportunity to participate in this conversation here obviously as a resident who cares immensely about my city I 'm also here as the program manager for international education for Christchurch and said in both capacities I am a hundred percent convinced that international education offers immense value to our city 's prosperity I feel that at the moment is a bit of a tricky time for international education with looming government changes that could have serious impact on our industry 's ability to attract talent to the city on behalf I feel that now is a opportunity for us to work together with industry collectively to present a bold message internationally that Christchurch is future focused and absolutely welcoming to migrants so I 've got a guy just click through here I 've got quite a large slide deck and I 'm just gonna zip through them quickly and make them available later for your reference I talked a little bit about the size of the sector the benefits of the city as well does in this space so many of you know International Education is the fourth largest export earner for New Zealand locally the industry is worth 310 million supporting 5000 high-value jobs and we have a goal to increase that to a billion by 2025 so combined with the tourism goals that 'd be about 3 billion contribution to the local economy by 2025 so the benefits to our city the flow-on effect from international education far outweighs the immediate economic impact international education connects Christchurch to the world it contributes to our soft power via global innovation human development diplomatic and trade relate relations strengthened by strong international alumni networks Kiwi students also benefit from their exposure to international perspectives and develop their cultural competency so that they are more competitive in the global workforce in the global workplace it provides education improves education amenities for local residents because our institutions must must remain globally competitive to attract global students it also provides the city with skilled migrants high-value short and long stay visitors as well as event participants academic researchers and international trade connections so from an economic point for every dollar invested by the city there is a return on that investment of 23 for the local economy from a visitor perspective from a visitor perspective the students and their families are high-value visitors they visit multiple times and on average spend much more than your average visitor from a labor market perspective as you all know in Christchurch we have a slight problem in the fact that we 're facing a 73,000 labor shortage gap by 2031 however Christchurch NZ estimates that if we meet our targets in 2025 as a result of the international education strategy there will be 22,000 University graduates to create a pool of talent for us to choose from to close this gap we know that about 40% of students internationally want to stay in their destination that they study but we also know that only 20% of those students are actually able to receive permanent residency five years after their student visa is awarded so we know that we have a lot to do to ensure the stickiness of our city to make sure that these young people choose Christchurch to said that our local businesses are fantastic at creating new innovation but sometimes struggle particularly with international commercialization so these students here they bring multinational experience and cultural competency that offers immense value to local businesses ability to take these products to the world and to grow the canterbury inc brand so what does Christchurch NZ do to improve outcomes with our industry partners okay it 's a nice picture too you know we ensure that we are telling the story together with industry we employ our students to tell the story for us and through them we put on a range of activities to welcome our students to the city and we support pathways to employment so in this program alone we 've supported 200 students to find work in Christchurch and a hundred of them are now employed in their field of study thank you very much Bri and I know that you know restricted to five minutes because of the being an individual submission as opposed to an institutional one so it might have been better to orchestrate this is an institutional presentation on behalf of Christchurch part of that bigger picture but thank you very much for for the presentation and if they can be if the slides could be pop online then we 'll have the opportunity to look at those in more detail but thank you very much for your time this afternoon yeah that 's appreciated _"

    "text": "Tabaka era thank face new brighton Hugh mold welcome Gennaro I counsel I 'm humid a member of the Incans Synod of Christchurch until they meet again in September so hopefully you 'll get a friendly Bishop but we 've already started a campaign for Bigfoot bishop so I don 't know whether that 's gonna work represent what about smaller organizations rather than the diocese I 'm here as part of a pic so I did try and convince them that they should arrange business shirts but as a youth organization going to Easter camp they felt that the t-shirts were much better but it 's designed by our youth worker who is part of the Anglican parish of East Christchurch you may well know us as a pig here 's a different meaning and needless to say I don 't want to talk to you about economics but I do I actually want to talk to you about equity and not equality you as counsel are called to represent equality your ratepayers demand that you serve them just as much as anyone else well sometimes those with money 's okay I don 't actually care about those people I care about the ones without money those that you are called to serve now and the foundation of this city of the Canterbury settlement the provincial council was actually given a funding model that you follow to this day no one or not the third the third the third or in this case the third and the two-thirds are absolutely relevant unfortunately the city would not have you spend a third of your budget on the church originally however the sale of the land did state that a third of the income would go to the Anglican Diocese of Christchurch or our church property trustees we will graciously let you keep that third however another third was to go to the social good of the city of the region and I 'm glad to say that approximately a third of your budget although I do note that James did point out that it 's a decreasing and declining part of your budget has for since perhaps we 'll say a period not that long ago being dedicated to looking well my concern is that just as we 've talked about social housing with River and Katrina that you might feel that capital expenses really where your game but your your your authority as council ends I would like to be clear that just like my friends from youth alive trust my friends that talk about art and about social goods resiliency is something the city really needs at the moment resilience is that word where I wasn 't going to say it originally but I 've had a week where I needed to be resilient my apologies for or should I say my absolute privilege to say you have got to enjoy an extra 10 minutes on me last week I don 't know who got to use it up whether or not you got a break or someone spoke longer but I was actually sitting not far away or should I say flat on my back not far away because I managed to flip my car on Saturday morning not annual region you 're okay why not show answer for that one I should say on reason and is one of the two employees that make up the full time equivalent community worker at two Walker utter ha sin faiths now of course all of you that have got your social media out outfits are open particularly Fae book do feel free to pop and pop a like on there at some plates New Brighton you 'll see my social media presents there it 's usually me or Joe that tells you some warm fuzzy and occasionally we ask for someone to help us come and cut old people 's no tainer toenails not noses we don 't cut noses off but we do need help and in fact we have around about 40 or more volunteers I 'd like to say like James I have 45 volunteers i approximate it at 40 we do actually as I say have five days a week coverage as community workers and occasionally we do get council grants but we 're also funded by writer and the David Ellison trust David Ellison was a lovely man who happened to be the nephew of the Bishop of London worked for our wonderful he quite liked eating with our Waifs and strays at our community meal our community meal was open to anyone including counselors we have it on a Wednesday ran about twelve o 'clock we start before we go into our eating space with a song and Kai and those have gathered since about 11 o 'clock have probably had a cup or two or three of coffee sometimes one two or four sugars and that 's all free we asked for a coat ah but what we are is we are the Love Boat we are tell Walker utter ha and we journey together and we 're part of the resiliency of the East but we 're only one aspect of what a pig does for the city and we 're not asking for you to do a lot for us in fact we 're only asking you to do what you need to what you morally obliged to what the city has done or should have done from word one from day one from 1850 or at least 1876 onwards we need to be taking here and using that not about the monetary value but it is about the value you put on those that are needing equity not equality equity means that you actually serve those that are worse off first resiliency after news quakes is very easy for those with credit cards and professional lives or social networks that provided them easy escape or a simple solution for those that don 't have a simple solution for those with no money to spear in their bank account no car to drive the fact that we 're talking about motorways or car parking or bringing revitalization to our central city business district may all be relevant but it 's only relevant to them to a point and just like James pointed out I turned concerned about Thompson Park and the rail witty or Rafferty domain depending on whether you 're local or not and as I say I mean we do training we do Red Cross things but I sometimes walk and I have to when I walk around Thompson Park or Rafferty domain I do see the freedom campus but I also see the locals who have from being two-bit I see the ones where they drive this station wagon to park up along Main Marine Parade and know they 're not freedom camping they 're homeless we give them a hot coffee during the day but at 4 o 'clock we close our doors we have to every now and again we know someone comes and sleeps under our veranda every now and again we know that someone 's going through a hard time we try and provide them with equity equality friendship and fellowship we are a pit but we are to walk out of here we are the boat that asks you to do nothing but come and I want you to be the Council that remembers that as a city you were founded with principles of love and fellowship and goodwill to all and Eve if we disagree about what we do without brass or should I say our bricks and mortar remember that Victoria was honest when she said we care about the last the least and the lost and even if we don 't do it under the same branding all we don 't claim to be the only Church and we don 't claim to be the only place that does good but remember we try to do what we are responsible for but we don 't do what you do you have much better tools and mechanisms to do things we can only have pick up the pieces thank you very much oh thank you very much that was some very impressive reputation I just asked you around the comments around the people who are homeless in the rough et New Brighton area hmm well you may be aware that City machine actually helped us to account for the number of homeless in the city and it came around 200 people which I certainly know from my eeriness in my suburb especially near Eddington that there 's a lot of other hidden people our council have a fund it 's a community resilience fund we are in fact housing first as a government-backed program we could add two we could contribute to I just wonder if you think that might be a good way for us to as a the worst off certainly would be be welcome to see further contribution towards housing it is one that we obviously have close links to council services and to the Ministry of Social Development so we do definitely make referrals but use any through the thoughts that could happen in this chamber or through the work of that councillors all that the staff would be most welcome Sarah yes oh no I 'm sorry I didn 't look I didn 't look people I saw you is that okay yeah thanks very much for your time appreciated _"

    "text": "Richi Connell it 's a maken thank you and welcome hi everybody thank you for your audience on a day like this I know that everybody probably prefer to be outside enjoying a great Canterbury day but look anyway my name is Ritchie Connell local resident for four years and I 'm here to urge you as counselors decision makers to look at the funding allocation supporting promoting and enabling the arts and cultural endeavors across a city as part of a rich and vibrant city we need to do more so that we 're not left behind now my submission focused on the theme of rebuilding the cultural and artistic fabric of the city alongside the bricks and mortars that support this and I want to take this opportunity to expand on this a bit as a rate payer and a post-earthquake entrant now domiciled and invested here for the long term this is so very important for the Richmond of the local community a community that we all have the privilege of both living and enjoying and while we know that the investment in buildings facilities placemaking and we will not have much hope in regenerating the city 's vibrancy and creative authority without the considered support and actions from you all as decision makers and driving forward a stronger arts strategy this in my humble and hopeful opinion can be a defining factor in the rebuilding of the city and what it is known for not only that it can be a huge factor in what the city can and will be known for so a sporting Colossus yes and I can already hear from today there 's been a lot of chatter around those kinds of stadia a city of gardens and green space a place where outdoors are on our doorstep a tech hub hub an environmental hub perhaps but a cultural and artistic Renaissance would complement complement these factors in a very powerful way but we need a strategy and we need investment and digging a little deeper into this as recently as April the council 's art strategy was highlighted in the local news where canterbury uni lecturer alison Loveridge commented on the the short-term sought to medium term and I quote Christchurch I 've just got your free Wi-Fi come up there thanks for their Christchurch 's chances of emulating the more successful New Zealand art scenes of Auckland and Wellington are slight so this is my concern considering the next ten years of planning yes we need to have the infrastructure but we also need to frame the cultural fabric to support this local artists musicians poets thespians comedians culture groups you name it they all form an important piece here a cumulative effect connecting these people providing the pathway and opportunity of investment to the wider community can enjoy this is a very positive story for the council and this is something I would be happy to see my rates continue to support and to be a truly successful City we need to invest in harness and the intangibles here make them tangible for the ratepayers the community and the people who want to come and visit and play here so key themes that kind of motivate this I believe one invest in the arts and the cultural fabric for the people of the city to grow artistic artistic endeavor sector as they can 't_``_206.28 do it all for be the connector of those who can deliver the artistic content and five let 's make Christchurch a cultural and artistic hub that we can all be proud of and underpin this with a clear and working arts strategy so increased funding to nurture and engage the arts and cultural community from youth student mature individuals groups and organizations will help put Christ roots engagement and purpose for the Arts well back in focus we desperately need to retain and empower these communities to make sure this 10-year plan also sets the course for future development it 's critical Christchurch activates arts hand-in-hand with the facilities it is critical Christchurch invests in what comes in and around the buildings that engages through art music performance and other installations or experiences we can be different and we can be leaders and the risk is we end up building facilities and services required for a functioning City but we leave the regeneration and rebuilding as people live flounder stuck perhaps in the suburbs ducking in and out of shopping malls in an attempt Christchurch is a rebuilt city but doesn 't have the soul to engage the strength of the city is its people as you well know arts and culture and creativity are the foundations of a healthy and centered city all the great cities in the world have rich and diverse cultural cultures and arts are at their centre and that 's what I believe Christchurch needs not only to invest funds into but to get on and deliver in the everyday and in conclusion to my submission if we commit to building an art strategy that supports the cultural fabric if we invest in support and the artistic endeavor in the local community then we will deliver a rounded experience for all those who live and visit and that would make me a proud ratepayer thank you I 've had my microphone off thank you very much for your submission could you email through your presentation because there 's obviously a lot more detail than the one that you provided and writing but it was very powerful so thank you very much appreciate time cool thank you _"

    "text": "Ian McHenry good afternoon time try squeeze into five minutes should take about five hours into the subject but llamar a part of the seventh District Council for past 20 years and I 've worked in sport business and commerce around the globe for thirty years I started my career at Lancaster Parkin 89 days we used to host multiple professional and amateur sporting events concerts and community events post way to spark I 've worked for PG Wrightson I hit up a business unit that was supplier of intellectual property and consultant to small State stadiums across the world I 'm currently the GM of grounds mysteries for New Zealand I 'm not here to give you a view on the impact of the model and the benefit the stadium but but as a rate payer selim I believe I represent the silent majority and of a multi-purpose stadium being built in Christchurch I aim to identify the opportunities at home disturbance in a truly regional community and cultural multi-purpose stadium full of Canterbury the wider New Zealand can be proud of and a stadium like Lancaster park that global recognition so in terms of the stadium functions what I want to first of all head on is that absolutely the roof is imperative and modern day and age it 's around a hyper tier system and it can be used for 20-plus hours per week 52 weeks in a year as part of every professional sport be at the core sports that we would have be a rugby league and football the stadium should also accommodate junior teams and the local community clubs I used to mate that a thousand children per year 52 weeks of the year can can utilize the stadium in terms of during pro sports games in fact in terms of the stadium multiple sports events could be played on the stadiums on any given day so Hagley Park is used for the community go down there and have community children 's sports events I believe and Easter made up to 6000 children will get is to play sport on the stadium per year plus parenting caregivers obviously coming in and joining the city in terms of cultural and community events so my point look at the full slide bar models and models all around the state and around the world I 've seen the list is unlimited in terms of some of the events you can have so cars motor bike rallies a ski week in terms of you could build a snow slope in there music festivals brass band competitions marching festivals garden horticultural clubs university graduation that 's what they do it here at the stadium every year in Melbourne which I 've been a part of that stadium and helping them develop their systems Rock Climbing Walls eat games is huge now we 're talking about being older kids coming in and filling a stadium and actually playing sports games on computers and stadiums the sport Canterbury have a go days kids try the lines in the Christchurch marathon what about national dog trials and national young farmers competitions national and regional regional kapa haka Vince x-games and BMX Nationals kora games the base to school of in touch nationals means mastered sporting events equestrian and show jumping craft and hobby shows and even religious events the stadium design should cafes and that 's a growing trend that we 're seeing around the world that it 's not disconnected but it 's connected to the wider community and we 've got a great opportunity obviously in the heart of the city to achieve that the stadium operations should engage the schools the community organizations for fundraising opportunities by assisting invent delivery and this stadium is a real opportunity to embrace the community build a connected operating model so this stadium will not be a white elephant but won 't be a lot of them but embrace the regular daily activity for the wider Canterbury community as one and as part of the cell and District Council a rate payer there I believe that it 's the onus is on us and why Mac and the wider Canterbury region to help be a part of this and it support the phoning bottles that you might design so I 've got a graph here in terms of the molecule sustained in the breakdown of group users as a percentage per year pro sport I 've got a 25 percent once at 6% you can see you know it 's a community focused and I think that we 've got to start talking about that because too much emphasis is put on professional sports and that 's not what it 's about these days in terms of economic impact and I haven 't got a lot of time but in terms of pro sport and concert we 're talking about six hundred and twenty five thousand people per year would go through the gates if I was using a conservative figure of a hundred dollars spent on average each of em per person we 're talking a return of sixty-two million to the local economy and that estimates and some homes that I 've done based on the four slidebar model so thanks for your time today I know you 've probably had a lot of feedback on this but I thought a important that knowing a lot about the subject that I come in and get my 5 sins with thanks greatly appreciated and I 've a stuff to put the actual you know what you 've received today on on the everyone to see it 's you know I 'm sticking to time with everyone because it 's just to keep things rolling but thank you very much but your submission thank you not many people know the secret talent of Jana Johansson on the football field _"

    "text": "aimes good to see you youth alive trust people you seen the picture I 've been manager of you know I 've chose for 15 years waiting for your king on Saturdays so you do there aren 't many Saturdays we don 't work and that 's kind of a lot of staff as well this the person I 've actually sat in this seat and kind of sat for other counselors I 've been working in not-for-profits for 20 years I realize it 's a thankless job and what you 're gonna do today and have been doing over the long term plan it 's very thankless people are gonna hate you for the decisions you make thank you thanks the chair yeah but I understand I understand that is a thankless job but on a genuine know without tense sounding to slamming I just wanna honor you for the work that you are doing as leadership over the city and yeah we do recognize that these are tough job and I recognize you could probably all getting high paid jobs elsewhere so thank you I 've got a the local perspective Thompson Park is one of our most used parks in our area in the East Christchurch where you thought electricity 's based it 's got a large skate park and large play area and a ban Burton do as well however there 's a part of the park which has become known as the Dust Bowl all the way the Freedom Park is the campus Park and this area does need and looking at we 've been talking to the local community board and we 've talked to some of the council staff as well over putting the bit of a plan it 's put a full-size basketball court in there which is why I 've got a small visual aid and to admit some of the paths more accessible some new toilet block some security cameras water fountains and secure the entrance as well we actually don 't know what figure it 's gonna cost to renovate the area there is some money in the LTP to upgrade it we don 't think there 's enough so I 'm just advocating on behalf of our community fixed secondly I just want to mention the tennis courts at Rafferty domain they 've been forth between four courts there for many years have been well used and they are very rundown and back in 2015 there was two hundred and twenty-two thousand in the LTP to upgrade these tennis courts and we knew them and that 's been taken out in this upgrade of the LTP and are we encouraging and you guys to put that back into the LTP to upgrade the tennis courts there is a local Sports Group who wants to take them over and they want to build multi sports courts over the top of the tennis courts however our concern and some of my friends and colleagues concern is that they will be then using them every night and on weekends and that we will not be able to play a tennis on them as well and I 'm proposing that you allow staff to look at a limited review of the reserve management plan for graffiti domain so that we can have both not one or the other so we can keep there and then that the Sports Group can still build their multi sports courts even beside them or next to them you 'll see on the picture that 's where the old of the temporary housing was and there is plenty of space around there and it is a great free resource that families do make good use of thirdly I just want to mention the strength in this communities fund and I acknowledge the fact that city the Christchurch City Council does give money to not-for-profit groups to to strengthen their capacity in working with the hundreds of thousands of people in which we do work with in our local community however seven million dollars was given last year to nine hundred groups but ten years ago 8.2 million dollars was given and relatively that 's a smaller amount and I hear rumors with in funding circles that that might well might be decreased at some point and I would state that that 's probably the best value for money that you could actually get by just putting seven million dollars to nine hundred groups which is probably affecting 't be such a bad thing to do and triple that amount that you could give to get the ball triple the amount of outcome and you would say well where could we tear that money from probably numerous places and might be a bit controversial here and just talk about Christ yet City Libraries and they have a 30 million dollar budget of operational costs every year and I think that 's the City Council 's were way of supporting community hubs in reality they do deliver books and they deliver some digital information as well but I would say they 're not really community hub a community hub is somebody who has youth programs parenting programs maybe some budgeting programs and counseling 's and recreation and you are allowed to make a little bit of noise for example youth alive trust that I manage has been there 's a wide variety of programs in our community hub we ran 216 youth club nights last year for 3668 young people we ran basketball clubs kitchen club craft clubs intermediates and teens clubs 464 people attended our 11 holiday programs parenting programs for over 500 parents every week five music tutors have taught musical instruments 235 young people every week not to mention the youth workers that we 've got in schools and the new rights and library and the big community events that we help organize which over 7,000 people have attended ran by a relatively small staff and over 45 volunteers who give 9,000 hours free of charge every year youth alive trust is grateful for the money that we get from strengthening communities fund we get 25,000 a year and we 've got three years worth of funding for that however that is reality half the cost of one librarian and could we be so bold to say that we might just give a little bit more value for money than half a librarian the community hood we are based out in New Brighton has 13 other regularly use of the building including budget advisers Plunkett Sport Canterbury the parent in place Eastern sports to large churches blood donor events weekly breast feeding and schools using the as well now in my 10 minute submission I 'm way that you 're gonna run the City Council but I wanted to plant a wee seed as to what is a community hub how can we best run a community hubs and our libraries going to continue to be libraries or can we convert them to be community hubs and can they be more versatile can 25% of the building house books and digital farmer and then can the rest of it be running parenting programs youth programs children 's programs or maybe we can take two million dollars off the budgets of libraries or the budgets of parks and give them to a youth agencies in the city who could run youth programs every night for young people or every weekend because that is the cry we hear all the time there 's no way for our young people to go I 'm just so in lots of things out there and am I expecting you to come up with all the answers but I do want to just plant a few seeds introduce myself and just put a few views forward thanks for your time any questions central government provide any funding for these support services we get from the exhausts many philanthropic so 50% of our funding comes through grants and lotteries cogs rad foundation believe me stay doesn 't all this the use of fund youth hopes many of youth development funds three youth agencies in Christchurch and these have been long-running contracts and not allowed other youth agencies to get in there as well I think there is a gap and I would love government jump on board and fund youth hubs yes I 'll community hubs as well maybe that could be a joint thinking with city council David and particularly decrease and we measure mainly through stories of young people like I mentioned 45 volunteers half of those are teenagers themselves and they 're the ones who are helping give back to the young people or in the children 's programs and the holiday programs so they 're developing leadership skills and being funneled into developing community spirit within themselves unfortunately can 't properly measure the effectiveness of our youth work then we 'd have two parallel worlds of what would have if we weren 't there but we just get heaps of positive feedback through schools through the police and doing surveys with parents as well often we would hear that young people like their own space so are you suggesting that if there was a bigger community space for everyone that the NS and a special part for them that that would work I believe there need to be in each community because young people like to stay within their various communities I think you could have eight community youth hopes around the city in existing places or as suggested you could possibly rename the libraries community hubs and you and youth programs and children 's programs within those very good thank you very much James good to see you again thank you yeah keep up the good work _"

    "text": "again could I invite Tom cross Abbot to come forward please good afternoon nice to see you it 's absolutely glorious outside so look for those who don 't mate who don 't know me I 'm Chris habit I 'm secretary of spokes but I 'm hearing a personal capacity today I 'm a long-term cyclist have done it for many many years started when I had an injury and needed to get myself healthy again so I started cycling and I 'd liked it and it 's been a lifelong passion I 've only got a few very brief messages I do not want you to delay the major sample routes and there 's many reasons for that one of the biggest problems we 've got in this country christchurch included there 's obesity and the more difficult we make it for people to engage in cycling and well active transport but not high impact transport the better it is for everybody in terms of the health benefits than the costs of health treatment and so I really really urge you when you 're considering things to give so that we start realizing the benefits now in metals both health and safety benefits will accrue from that sure an idea has shown that that 's what we want that 's what Christchurch ratepayers have said that they want so I just dude you once again to focus on that and the longer it takes the less the benefits that are realized we 're not getting them straight away we 're getting them down the track and people get used to not being active in their transport modes you know also ask when I look at the changes that come through that you include cycling by default and all your Sport changes it 's very hit and miss at the moment I 've just seen one for the Northern Corridor and it 's really hard to work out what is changing there I mean what the cycling impact is going to be so if you just really get someone to eyeball it and say this is the impact on cycling I 'd really appreciate that and so with spokes of home on secretary personal plea complete the Crushers coastal so much of it has been done but there are still some very unsafe sections particularly from the notes Bay through to surf lifesaving trapping like I saw on the news and the news problems that came through the funding has just been approved for the resource concerns Flair section that 's still not getting it done so I just urge you to get on and get it done just a little personal note I don 't want to see the money spent on a carbon stadium we have a stadium we can watch the rugby and many people myself included now prefer to watch it on TV so questions thank you questions from people Yanni thanks Chris thanks for the submission I just we 've had a lot of people well some people raised concern about how much is going on cycleways and obviously we 've got other things that we 're spending money on we 've also heard concern over the Cranford street the northern arterial extension if we wanted to keep the budget relatively the same but change the priorities do you have any thoughts about other that we consider deferring and just blowing up from that was do you think we should prioritize recreational cycling as much as we 're prioritizing the commuting cycling or would it make no difference oh good questions all cycling is good I think you need to be a recreational cyclists before you become a commuter well maybe not maybe some people I know I started sucked in the middle of a London winter where I missed the opportunity to get a cheap cheap ass for the next several months and I suddenly saw it was going up 10 20 percent no I said I don 't want to pay that so I started cycling in the middle of winter so and to answer your question recreational or commuter cycling I think the powers are used by everybody so if you do one you 're doing Tavor really the key thing is to make sure that there 's safe ways for people to get about exon well thank you very much for your submission it 's that 's great to hear from you thank you thank you very much thank you thank you we 're enjoying it so far _"

background Mike and I business partners and a number of speeches we also have Mex in Glenn pukowski business partners in this particular project a background just quickly mix and Glenn were involved with the palms development home base up Nations Road expensive that development together with Max and Glenn Mike and I have been involved with the McKenzie and Willis development would currently doing the Duncan buildings on High Street so getting it off your dirty 30 list and we 're also investors with Richard Peebles in the Riverside farmers market so we 're doing a bit around town hopefully it just paints a bit of background that we 're invested in the city we 've bought a site up Northcote and it 's the old foodstuffs warehouse and we 've had a plan in to convert that to a sport and entertainment center which is what we want to talk to you quickly our presentation a community board level we 've had a check to the kept me a community board capital expec just so we want to get that sort of grassroots buy-in we 've got it 's the old food stuff distribution center it 's 17,000 square meters of internal space another 3,000 square meters of canopy and it 's it 's a it 's really well positioned in terms of links and roading to be what we think would could be an amazing asset for Christchurch which is a grassroots community-based Sports Hub obviously the metro is a great great asset to the to Christchurch but for everyone we 've talked to I just say in the nine courts just isn 't quite it 's not gonna cut it by quite a while away if they 're gonna if you 're gonna include futsal basketball netball and then all the smaller volleyballs and with a smaller group soon as we 've had a plan that we resource consent with which had 12 chords we can actually fit about 20 courts in total some of them being badminton and some of it just shows that it 's a huge base and it 's got capacity to to solve a lot of the sporting issues we think are going to be hitting our way in Christchurch and in sort of competing with the other cities like Wellington and Dunedin who 've got these indoor centres in most of the indoors yes I just just quickly I suppose to recap on we were at at the moment we have a resource consent that 's approved for an indoor sport centre as well as an entertainment center we know that we can easily convert that to our Sports Centre so that 's 20 thousand square metres 20 odd courts for community 450 car parks and the buildings been brought up to a hundred percent of code and we have good support from the sporting codes netball a futsal in basketball we are aware that there is a there is another mystery benefactor somewhere out there that they aren 't associated with our group we think they 've looked at our our property but they 're more associated with with netball by the looks of a purpose-built column-free ten or twelve court center house is not like that ours is like the Agricenter and Dunedin for those that have seen it but what we 're also saying is there 's a community-based sport and it gives control to the council and we believe that there are a number of sports from not just knit ball and futsal Impossibles but volleyball badminton fencing gymnastics that can all benefit from indoor sports either yeah there 's also twice the size of the proposed I think nipple to put forward so look we 're going to go back to nipple would have a good good chat him about hopefully getting some synergies around maybe combining the will Tony had been effective in trying to sort of get here on line in line with us because we sort of see this is something that they won 't just hate a neighbor or cater for it 's twice the size okay maybe you take some questions of Neroni okay Yanni the netball and mainland football presentation I 'm not quite clear what you 're asking for from us right so first went down this with nipple three years ago the big issue before they had this been effect on the big issue was underwriting beliefs they they thought they could paper but they had no they had no ability to actually sign that least in the lowest city can 't_''_362.34 do that so what we 're sort of saying is it was like the EDC Japan Wellington it can 't mean it really needs we feel the underwriting on the council to come in and say right we 're going to manage this thing we 're going to charge the codes a certain amount and hopefully you know you 'll recoup imagine 60 70 percent of the ongoing costs but I think there is going to be a shortfall for something like this we sort of see that that 's where the council can step in with your management skills and the fact that you can underwrite it and present and give the community something which is relatively cheap for the size of it but adds a lot of issues with the sporting coach the moment to go and purpose to twelve to three times what it would be in this instance here do you know how much in terms of underwriting the ongoing lease cost how much that is well we 're sort of talking figures of around about one and a half million dollars as a rent rental number obviously there would be a shell it would still we have you to do the foot out to and I guess it 's just early days in terms of probably gauging whether there is action an appetite for this kind of thing in Christchurch and if there is this brought together and figure out a way that we can all make it work together we don 't have all the answers and we 've sort of been the priests were they you know they had a bit of a go buddy developers drummer get you guys to underwrite this it really is so much easier if we just leave it as a as a warehouse in tolls in the another period so much ease if we just leave it at there but we just sort of see this is saying where do they go we don 't be sitting out on the sidelines freezing so it 's a bit selfish from a point of you better but we 're simply not doing it to sort of make money or even are there we just do it will be you know it 's already made the money for us we 've already made the money and if it carries on as a warehouse we just make just as much money as we would with you guys but we see there 's a bit of useful it 's it 's an arisen into his own it shouldn 't you know lends itself to this sort of thing industrial use Africa in Pauline on a different cool thing in the city the farmer 's market that you 're involved in and up in there more we need you expecting the completion date I wish you 're talking February year February March next year thank you can 't wait Pauling you say that they meet rise so do you see that there 's a potential that possibly that they could reduce the number swore a bit late to this getting this process books we 've had other discussions with the council around if they were to just go back the metro the obvious what thing would be to reduce to the core numbers and we kind of said we 'll look you could probably take it back down to three or four courts and have those your high in you know national games and then how will your grassroots done and something that 's about taking a good sex court out of it you must be taking somewhere near one hundred million dollars out of it twenty we 've been talking about that for a long long time and that 's this didn 't get off the ground last time not because of the concept that resources seem to approve this hoarding codes were behind it it was because we needed a commercial lease that really need the council to to take the lead on it and manage the sporting codes us go and directly says sporting courage gets a little bit more difficult in terms of tryna make it stack up we that 's a fair test against it for the city this is complementary to they 're more than necessarily yeah I think the Apple courts have got a have got a place you know it says imagine that there be some juggling still I mean it 's this theory on outdoor courts there and I they 're very busy Friday afternoon said day and Sundays but summer days when it 's cold certain grades rages or mornings Withers Baird they come to us we different ways of sharing it I think Haley still a ton of parking out four hundred okay thank you it 's a shame that everyone has to travel by car to these facilities by but it 's a good bus route down there towards strong and a good cycle rate to all right well look thank you very much for your submission and

advocate for the area and I am working quite closely through the summer residents association with our local community board and we really appreciate the support they 're giving to the area for the projects that are ongoing but today I 'm just representing myself not representing the summer hub I come here just as a resident and to just to just ask if we can make more some of being a destination on its own right such a great place for price which residents to come I mean local people love it we can use the beach the hills you know the village of anytime that we like so we live there but during the summertime we 're seeing just such a great increase in people coming out which is fantastic because there 's more people have got more leisure time their homes are appear they 're enjoying the chance of a stretched we 're seeing real problems with rubbish clean toilets gutters dirty we just say also public gardens you know just basic services aren 't being addressed so we are working on that with council we have community groups that guard and do voluntary gardening we 've got people collecting rubbish so it 's really great we 've got this excellent system going at the moment but coming summer even though we 've been assured that we will get better services just want to put it out there 's a need because what 's happening with grad searches for bringing all the expect tourism to the area and ideally they 'd come out to either Brighton or Sun or another Beach area and you 'd like to think that the infrastructures the area should cope with them it also includes lack of public toilets in the center of the village we 've got a beautiful nine million dollar building which is closed on Saturday afternoons in all day Sunday which are the busiest time so you 've got tourists and locals coming out in having to use public toilets and other thing that I just wanted to address was just to encourage you to keep the christchurch coastal pathway on your on your long-term plan and to fund it as much as you can it would be fantastic to get that finished and that 's not just from a tourism point of view and supporting what we heard about cyclists but it 's also around the safety of the children heard coming from ricklefs school into Sumner to vert Nash so just to allow the M to have the ability to bike to school that 's really important we 're seeing school buses the government spending I don 't know what on school buses every year to transport these children and I know when you 're a 12 13 year old boy I 've got three teenage boys being on your bike as should be right so to get that cycle way completed around there as a masters and then my other request again Sumner focused is the bays area skate project which if you 're aware is going through at the moment with worth funding in its some residents about three years and so we 've had a temporary ramp ramp in the area for about four or five years now and it 's so well used it 's amazing to see these kids out there being active but the best thing about it is you 've got young boys who had nothing to do in often they get themselves into trouble in having them in one area of the village which being identified and having a space where they know that they can interact that 's fantastic so instead of being at home on their couches and so forth they 're now and these give it and you got the little kids and older in the older the youth and then you 've also got skaters from town coming out and so it 's a really great facility so the little rep that we have there now is hopefully going to be part of a longer-term plan to get something permanent and Sumner just ask whether but with the toilet I mean I 'm just blown away blown away by this because you 're not the first person part of the consultation around the original design I mean was it raised I mean presumably the community board did the design did you sign off on the design or recommend the design to the council ordered to Council on the and the paper that came to council I mean there this may be highlighting we the problem lies which is if if something is ruled out at an earlier stage I don 't know that we get the advice that we need to actually consider whether we put on budget sufficient funding to clean them after hours or to create them in a style that they self claim and there 's plenty of options that are available now for public toilets that don 't actually require an enormous amount of optics they require a little bit more capital at the front end but you know I 'm just I know that I 'm not the only one sitting around the table that 's looking at this askance but you know as I say others have raised it and it is something that we 're going to have to have are spending at least half an hour to schoolchildren 45 minutes into school well their time they can i annoy but there is a potential time there as well thank you very much for your submission that 's very much appreciated thank you _"

    "text": "Angela Bray 's yo good morning and I just wanted to start by saying thank you so much for the time that you 're giving listening today and also with reading all the submissions I know there 's been heaps and we 're really just here to be a picture for you we 'd like to be an image in your mind whenever you 're thinking about how cycling is incorporated into the plan I am they moved back to New Zealand in 2009 and I bought a bike in my first week here I have been a reluctant cyclist a reluctant driver since I turned 16 in New Hampshire and my parents insisted that I get my license and when I moved here Christchurch honestly compared to where I grew up in New Hampshire seem like a cycling utopia it 's flat it 's easy to navigate there 's no snow on the ground and there are these enormous shoulders on all of the roads they were for those cars but at least they existed people thought I was crazy people would go believe you cycle here and I I honestly I had a couple of close calls but I never felt unsafe on a bike until I got pregnant and there is just something about those extra 30 centimeters or on the middle that can make sneaking down Rickerson road between backed up traffic and bumper to bumper cars on the other side kind of intimidating and there 's that thought that suddenly if somebody pulls a left without indicating it 's not just my life anymore it 's me and it 's hard and that oh through the pregnancy people kept saying to me Angela you 're gonna have to give up the bike you 're gonna have to start driving you 're gonna have to use your car and we did because you know they have to have a helmet and they don 't wear them from the beginning but as soon as she was big enough to have a helmet on we had the trailer on the back I was out on the back streets making sure I could handle the corners making sure I knew how long it took me to get through the and when she turned 2 we bought this cycle seat and the you 've got those pictures are from the first day we put her on the front of the bike with me and it was just it was love at first sight she gets to hold the handlebars she can Bing my Bell at people she thinks it 's the best thing in that honestly the best part of our day our commute in the morning to preschool and we get a lot of lips we get a lot of comments I had somebody pull up next to me the other day in their car roll down the window and yell you 're awfully brave to be bringing that kid in traffic and I get it it 's scary yeah we go across we go across the Tower Junction every day and there 's that the lane that spoke the through and a corner it 's terrifying with a two-year-old on a bike but I 'm a mathematician and I know the numbers I teach math aha Glee last year was a horrible year for cycling in New Zealand quadrupled from the year before it went up to 18 and I want to be clear I 'm appalled by that number it 's a horrible number 18 is 18 too many but in the seemayer there were 6,000 people in New Zealand who died from heart disease and another thousand from complications due to type 2 diabetes one every 90 minutes one in nine New Zealand children something like 80 or 90 thousand kids are classified as clinically obese and that 's before we get into problems with public cars like the cost of the infrastructure and the cost of the environment and the issue of a generation of kids growing up believing that their personal timetable is what the world should revolve around and so when I think about how I 'm gonna raise my kid and how I 'm gonna protect her in the future I 've got to bring her up with a bike I 've got to bring her up active and in activities that are gonna keep her healthy and keep her communities healthy and keep her planet healthy and this is how I didn 't have to put in harm 's way to get to the library so we 're here to say thank you there has been some incredible work and I know that you guys get a lot of very vocal opposition to adding cycleways to the city but it 's worth it my parents just bought a house on frankly and that new away down frankly it 's just beautiful we love going through the city on the separated paths so we 're here to ask you to keep working on it to ask you to keep prioritizing finishing the cycle paths and keeping cycling infrastructure on the front page whenever we 're thinking about how the city can change and grow because it would be really nice if me and my friends could bring our kids up on our bikes if we could not have people yelling at us in the street because we 're daring to ride or the child on the front and if I could take my kid to the library without giving my mother a heart attack maybe so much for him yeah thank you yeah starting right _"

    "text": "Shareen may helps hi yes um well ha thought I had more time but I 'll try and get everything through um the thing is I think a lot of our problems and I 'm talking counsel as well come from the Rema it seems like this has become it was supposed to be enabling body but it has become a big step in which to beat people with and yeah it 's also from its originated a huge gravy train which is becoming longer and longer to the state we had a inspector come over to inspect our buildings and he closed our buildings down because we 're our business has been running for a very very long time since before Eric he may became it and into law so you know we were accommodations way back but on council books we weren 't so we had to go through a change of usage so inspector comes over he checks the buildings and he just closes us down being like that yeah we were completely bewildered when I asked them or tried to question them I wanted some helpful up again he simply said to me it was not his job to be helpful notice what I mean about a gravy train everybody 's got their own little jobs and you 've got to go through all of these little sections and every section is costing us all so much money that it 's just tying us tying us all Council included and you know the thing is it 's it 's absolutely killing private initiatives absolutely killing them and the other issue I did want to talk about was that I am very concerned about the reserves that they 'll simply shut out you know combustible vegetations grow into these reserve oops and unfortunately with climate change conditions becoming hotter and drier and those reserves are very susceptible to fire now the thing is Christchurch City Council are trying to figure out ways of dealing with wastewater and I really think they need to look at wastewater as being an asset rather than a nuisance that they 've got to try and get rid of if wastewater is treated to such good standards we need to have irrigation so that we can keep that vegetation moist and hopefully it won 't just all burn because our bush is needed for carbon sinks and it 's not gonna work if it keeps burning we have problems with misty Peaks reserve the tracts gone through the top of it and as also was opened up through a while for freedom campus and we had problem with the freedom campus actually creating bonfires on the top of the hill and amongst the combustible snow grass and you know I mean we used to stop them it 's not easy actually confronting these people because often they 're drunk often the wrong drugs and you 've got to confront them and say you can 't_''_212.16 do this but who are we to say that they can 't_``_215.43 do it and also trying to clean up after them we call them shittin goes because they leave their excrement all over the place toilet paper gets blown around some of the bushes some of the fences and guess who cleans it out yours truly try to bury it and clean up all this horrible is it would be nice if perhaps council would look more towards private initiatives what we are trying to create for the visitor how we are trying to alleviate these problems council can 't_``_254.79 do it on their own but they the regulations just kill initiative I mean I perhaps if locals were encouraged pets to have camping sites on their properties but you know you can 't stop them at the whole lot of permit you know expenses and expect them to have people on their property it 's a low cost so yeah I don 't know I don 't know what the answer is but I think the RMA is being misused sure thank you very much for your for your comments and you know I I kind of um yeah I think you 've raised a really good point and and you 've there are two issues that I think we would want to do some more work on and that is us and because we are looking at some options about how we could get quite reasonably priced actually no cost to the to the they would pay for them so and that 's that takes it away from being the I 'm effect object to the word freedom of its just breathe and I don 't know if you saw the television item last night about Kokoda yeah and and I 'm sure that was at the front of your mind as you were as you were speaking because I mean it is appalling so we do need to ensure that we 've got the right facilities and I know Andrew is very focused on this he 's our representative on on a nationwide working group on freedom camping so we 're hoping to get some good results out of central government we have applied for the funding from the tourism infrastructure fund for for toilets and akaroa in particular but obviously the need is is even greater than that so look you 've raised a number of issues I hear what you 're saying around the RMA we are very much you know expecting our organization to be a can-do organization that supports people through processes and certainly not to get a response to we need to make sure that we 're always on on our games so thank you very much for your submission it 's been very helpful indeed well I just leave those brochures with you those are the two businesses that you 've actually closed down and so yeah hopefully you 'll make it a bit easier on it you close this down mid season mid season and we were supposed to refund all of the money so yeah but thinking for their shirring thank you _"

    "text": "Andrew and Joe in a crore just Andrew hi my name 's edge across and we love little echo I rap obey on Banks Peninsula two key points for my submission today one is around their roads we 're very frustrated with their roads I 'm not sure where I 'm sure you 've already heard maintenance has not been done and there 's ongoingly not being done and we 've got to a point now or something if you don 't arrest the case where roads in here at bill that 's coming is going to swamp our little district over there because it really is given quite backwards it seems incredibly unfair that the the main service that we we get for our rates and they are substantial is the road and that there are roads based just on going the neglected now the other key thrust of my discussion with you this morning is around their district rules part of the problem we 've got no where we 've got a limited funding for roading and the peninsula is because their capital base isn 't growing and rules are very very oppressive the very tight it 's very very difficult to do any development on the on the plan that doesn 't seem to be very business progressive what seems to be happening is what we 're seeing as we see a lot of little houses we 're seeing a lot of people who are trying to avoid dealing with the Council on consenting issues so they are going down the route of the under 10 square metre houses the mobile homes and that 's the basis which I 've got no problem with I think it 's a good it 's a good outcome we want to see more people on the peninsula but you the council is missing out on any capital growth because they avoid it is so difficult to go through a district planning process to get concede to build or for any development that they are avoiding those those routes and so they think they 're dancing around us and so our cap bass is not growing and so income on the peninsula is not growing and then it comes back to 't take it on we 've done it once I 'll never do it again we the the rules that are staging it the size of sections just ends up with a whole lot of wasted ground once an absentee owner is in charge of a 40 hit deer block you want to write that round off it 's not going to produce anything ever again it all it does is generate weeds and problems for the district so I urge you to look at those district district rules around planning and consenting out there it is far too restrictive and it 's actually holding your side you need to grow everyone that 's coming here today is talking about the more money you need to spend you 're going to grow the capital base thank you thank you now don 't go away with good you 've lit you unlike everyone else 's leave time for questions no and Andrew to know your local councillor would like to start thank you and thanks for the submission you 're one of a number of submitters that we 've heard from some of focus particularly on the unsealed roads and some are focused on roads in general I 'm very aware of some of the failings of both and regularly put through maintenance requests do you have a view whether there is particular work that we need to be doing differently or more of whether that 's on the the unsealed or the sealed Road network or both I think I think I think the whole network is in trouble right now the level of maintenance that 's going on as being just not up to scratch so I think it 's actually probably the sealed roads is more of an issue at the moment that the surfaces are breaking up the potholes are starting in the and the ongoing maintenance required is going to be be huge I also priorities I just I really struggled to see how the money is being spent on the punch line that does it 's picking out specific well for example in Pigeon Bay at the moment there 's a huge number of trees coming out of it absolutely brilliant fantastic no issue with still coming out and the trucks are just destroying the repeal work so as fast as they spending money on you is wrong just in true that do you believe there 's a level of local knowledge that would be useful that maybe the community board could be a part of it sounds like a no-brainer to me it 's just incredibly frustrating to be a part of and and to watch the waste the other thing that seems to happen is that jobs are being elite they 've been tended in and given but no one no one 's following up to see whether we 're getting value for money for that the money 's being speed but no I came running down 60% of the job here or that the job was even relevant at the start so it 's yeah absolutely thank you very much look that I 'm een in actual fact the value that you brought to the table was and and the exchange that we 've just had so no yeah we have a number of challenges around our district playing at the moment but thank you very much you just external _"

    "text": "okay Lapras Joe it good morning well no man morning counselors it 's a fascinating process Daniel then I will just sort of pick out the bits of a rather sort of across-the-board submission the first few paragraphs it 's basically the ever spreading development of small townships around the city and the lack of because they 're so closely put together there 's a lack of the ability of long-term growing trees to improve the environment then literally listening to the each other 's laboratories being flashed but long term there 's no space for anything green and lovely to improve their environment within the whole planning thing the building of the inner city must remain a unique place to come to otherwise it will be again the doughnut system because they 're all going to get there they didn 't shops their towns their community halls and whatever and they will not come into the inner city so the town planning even though it 's well down the road is utterly critical and I think some of it leaves a lot to be desired the coastal hazards for be evidently accepted in the manner of agreements for the building processes of the building designs there are places in the world where this has actually been very well done it we could call them pole houses or whatever but we mustn 't ignore the reality of what Christchurch is no doubt one way or another going to face in climate change CCC HL capital release program the first one has ended I think the CCC HL has been a an enormous boon to our our city in so many ways over many years and I congratulate the council for holding onto it it 's existent has been challenged many times but I hope maybe you 'll be looking at a new capital release arrangement to face the city demands over the future years the user played listening to past speakers and user play systems should be looked at if in fact it is a very important issue one particular issue to a group of people that conversation could actually accept the fact that further funding will be acceptable to move it forward it 's a hot potato I accept space and the same emotion about whatever the project is so I think user pays for whatever you 're considering is well worth the debate the water bottling plants I think this is an enormous issue what 's happened is we have these vast lakes these vias aquifers and you have licenses that have been given like a pipe down to whatever the issues are throughout these lakes and licenses such as turning licenses being have been given and now have been taken over with endless millions and millions of dollars of litres of water being sold overseas but that is not in my opinion just to that one license it is actually undermining the entire aquifer system to the advantage of whoever has the new license but it is to the detriment of the city long term and I think it 's a whole new aspect of understanding what 's actually happening should be there and it should not happen that in this change of licenses and people say oh but they 've been given for thirty years or four years it has to be looked at because one because that 's the reality it 's one leg with one bore but there are there are requirements for the water across the city and the whole aquifer is not one person 's benefit as is happening at the moment particularly particularly in Tennant tannery licenses the drinking water I support everybody there 's going to be an enormous backlash of this is not the temporary measure that as has been reluctantly accepted but I think that if there was any other device used to make this a permanent situation there would be an utter outrage in the city and that is a real issue too to follow through the storm water and flood protection the woman earlier than me said it 's far better but I 've been here arguing for sticks River on a number of occasions it 's an utter disgrace I get a report back after the annual plan say the the the machine whatever it is it goes up and down has been going there once or twice it does no good at all it changes absolutely nothing to the River Edge to the mug disgrace so why where as you 're looking more particularly at Heathcott and even that concentration is there not to waving it but the sticks has just been ignored and it 's gone on for year after year and I think it 's a disgrace and I really do support what the previous submitter said in every sense she said it very well the community facilities as I read this thought it seemed to me that the sports facility spending was overall going to be considerably larger whether you take in the swimming pools and you take in the sports stadiums you take anything to the arts funding of which it seems as if there 's only approximately 22 million left after the finishing of the Town Hall I fear the outcome for the court theatre which is what I 'm here to promote in a sense that it will be severely compromised and I urge you to see that this is not only one of the city 's finest institutions it 's actually actually remarked upon throughout the country and overseas it is an extraordinary organization and therefore if sense that really really celebrates this as a center point within the city will be a tragedy so I urge the council at its time of consideration to see just how special it is has been and should be but then the city 's arts institution and the hold of all the arts vicinity but I particularly speak to the court theatre as facilities well this was a Barbra although you 've come to the eat okay right can I just make one point one tiny point on the back page if you drive through the inner city you can 't there 's so many street signs they 're not there or you can 't see them could you please look at kindly just increasing the number increasing the size so they 're visible and could you please ask the city businesses to put a number there it 's just a tiny thing but it is enormous ly difficult not yet there 's no signal as we I don 't think that 's just a basic thing we should move too much thank you very much for your submission don we look and then I say to all of the submitters we have read all of the submissions and when you come to the table please focus on the key points that you want to leave with us _"

    "text": "is Caroline Sadao is a welcome what I really ask is that as a council you focus on taking the actions that are needed now to make constitutes a livable city in the future and this means change not doing what we 've done before and not rebuilding Christchurch as it was before and I think it also means being brave and spelling out your vision for the city and standing up to those who want to chip away at the changes that will make the city sustainable Christchurch needs to be pedestrian and circle friendly accessible and people focused and looking forward I 'd like you to drive your planning from the 2011 draft central city plan the people spoke through this year an idea process and the vision articulated and that remains a positive clear and viable vision for Christchurch I know you know these but the linking statements from sharing ideas said people must be placed at the centre having an abundance of green space to create people friendly places have integrated for affordable transport and experts networks with pedestrians as a priority include walkways circle ways City this I think is the Christchurch we need to have and we need to really stay focused to achieve it now I really appreciate some positive steps the council has taken and I 'll never mount isn 't and I work at the University and I struggled to work most days so there 's a couple of things I particularly shape a water park into who know a laneway long Manchester Street as a great space it 's created views openness and a fantastic seat pathway the Wooster Street cycle way is imperfect but significantly safer than the main road alternatives and the Uni start from Hagley Park to the university is just it 's a well use team it 's a wonderful thing a real sign of how we could do more here so ask please do not slow the implementation of cycleway development rather I ask that you prioritize cycleways increase investment in them speed up the construction and I know you do know this but I 'm sure the people who are worried about some friendly building spell things I already know so I 'm going getting cyclists around the city safely they make neighborhoods safer for pedestrians by reducing traffic speed they improve air quality by reducing car use their step towards carbon neutrality and lowering greenhouse gases their step towards a healthier population and they contribute to connected communities and improve mental health walking and cycling is the way of the future we must prioritize it and the redevelopment of our city and I think if we do not make Christchurch an accessible people friendly City with walkways cycle wastes and high quality public spaces we will have an unsustainable City and we will end up potentially with an empty city surrounded by the surprisingly well designed suburbs and outlying towns like Lincoln couple of the specific things I support the Linwood Woolston pool and the funding of local community events and initiatives particularly in the poor poor parts of town I do not support prioritizing the multi-use arena big-ticket projects like this have a long history of unsubstantiated and ultimately unrealized promises of revenue generation Christchurch needs to focus on things that improve the court the everyday quality of life of its citizens housing high-quality environment since I 've got just a minute more listen I just want to say I when I cycle on that the Wooster Street stack away and then unicycle getting across town from about Letterman Square to the park is really difficult there are there are no safe roads there for me half the roads I can 't go up with me so I go the wrong way for my street and the others are very tight with far too much happening on them to be safe as I can so I 'd love to see a link east-west across town that 's that 's further north do you see the north yes because I come up late of a square and I want to go straight ahead Jonnie one of the options that we looked at would you support going all the way down the wood over to the Aven River and then going across the Aven River through the town and then back up that way I Drive the area yeah I would use that I I mean I 'm one of these who likes to take a block or maybe to detour through you looking for the other I think that 's a that 's a huge detour that one a dieter at the moment I go to Wooster and then back across the past here foot and then back across presume you could go faster if you were off road longer yes yeah you can 't go down Gloucester Gloucester yeah but it 's not gonna be blocked forever so I used gosta Street used to be my road but it will be again right yeah yeah so here I 've got the street at the moment it 's really now yeah all right look yeah I mean part of it raises a an issue I mean once Manchester streets all open up again then I mean I think the the cross route starts to look a little bit more obvious through the center yeah yeah and then and then you hit whatever that kill more or it just makes me heavy it 's a fabulous space no I the Hadley part makes me happy whether I 'm walking or whatever actually I 'm submission that 's that 's extremely helpful thank you _"

    "text": "Jocelin Pepperell good morning good morning and thanks for the opportunity to submit in person and the brief amount of time that I have I 'd like to concentrate on perhaps four aspects of my written submission there stormwater transport education events and for each of these I 'll have a personal as well as community interest in them as someone who spends a vast amount of my working time educating children and young people about our stormwater network and how to protect our waterways I think the council must prioritize and improved wastewater and stormwater network over smooth roads or more importantly invest in improving the stormwater infrastructure at the same time Road improve Road improvements are being made plan improvements for more than one value we must make a concerted effort to clean up her urban rivers and reduce the likelihood of wastewater overflow during times of peak rainfall at a time when we urban dwellers complain about contaminate and unsolvable rivers in our rural hinterland for him the finger of blame had intensified farming we must be doing more to clean up our own act within our so that contaminants are captured and filtered before water flows into our River network I encourage the council to look for opportunities to provide mitigation measures during streetscape improvement this week I was showing a group of young people around the low impact urban design principles being put in place in new developments and pools for swales retention ponds permeable surfaces etc of increasing intensification of development in existing urban areas I would like to see the council working with householders and developers to ensure an increased use of permeable services use of rainwater capture tanks and treatment of stormwater via rain gardens I am afford the use of such features where new public spaces are being built but more needs to be done with private citizens are rebuilding alongside set time for structure inhabitants they must be an increase in concurrent community education about storm water issues and what people can do to protect our waterways in terms of transport I 'm just extremely supportive of the major cycleway program as they will encourage more people to cycle and so reduce the impact on eroding Network reduced congestion be months last year cycle touring in Europe Britain and Canada I 'm much more appreciative of the importance of safety separated cycled way network it was a sheer pleasure cycling through Germany in France and through these cities it was a different story when I got too much of Britain I was surprised by how easy it was to get around in London seeing the number of people cycling in London because they put these good cycle ways and was pretty amazing I also would love to see more transparency and visible integrated public transport system through the Greater Christchurch I think in the public transport working group be much more useful to increased public Trent transport patronage particularly a bus lanes ensure a speedy ride for passengers and I saw this in Britain and Canada as well public and public use of Park and Ride processes and over the years I 've lived in Christchurch I really appreciated the many free events then the city is put on and many of these are valuable and giving the city a positive five I 'd like to see though that we 't want to see more bigger events in Christchurch I really appreciate it as a member of the Mount Pleasant community the support we get for running events like eastery fest and also the support that the council gives for C week program and a corridor education I know this is not specific to thee of the plan but I really wanted to say the council needs to continue to provide education for sustainability through your learning through Action Team and enhance the efficacy of that team 's work by restoring the financial support for and MoU with and virus schools during the past week I 've been facilitating an untouched world charitable trust program involving 20 young people at the end of the week advocated for more environmental education and schools those that have been an average schools during their primary school wanted to see is extended to secondary but the funding for specialist facilitators was not available enviros schools as a tried and trusted program that compliment complements the council 's current le OTC programs and supports a number of Kim outcomes particularly in sustainable use of resources experiences with more funding from the city in various schools may well be better able to support secondary schools wishing to integrate education sustainability within their programs Auckland Council has done this partly through the young leaders and sustainability program been ultimately strict and footpath renewal has been they 're somewhat exercised me refurbishment of footpaths should only occur when they 're obvious hazards I cannot understand the need for current footpaths renewal on major hornbook road now present when it 's actually Mount Pleasant Road that is much more damaged it makes me wonder whether a proper assessment of the repair has been need has been done whether the current repair is business as usual unnecessary and disruptive my final point I would like to see that council take much more of the parks maintenance Whitbeck in-house to improve the quality of work the conditions of the workers and perhaps foster an integrated approach to environmental restoration and maintenance certainly some of the estuaries to history restoration work we have done as a community and partnership with Council rangers has been undone by contract maintenance workers mowing over the those of us seeking biodiversity enhancement look I know you 've come to time but can you just tell me the names of the two roads again the one that 's been done on the winter road it 's been done we are looking for examples of this because that is what we are very concerned about so we don 't want a BAU approach we want a needs-based approach so thank you very much _"

    "text": "miles McIntosh um thanks for the opportunity to on the Saturday you guys are here all day so it 's some really appreciated and I think you 're doing a great job so thanks so I 'm here to talk about the cycle ways and specifically the major cycle route network first of all I want to congratulate the council for remaining committed to the major cycle routes once they 're finished they 're going to be a real game-changer for our city and really make cycling more accessible for people who currently just too afraid or don 't feel it 's safe on the roads at the moment it 's great you know I want to use the sections that are completed already and really looking forward to what 's to come secondly I 'd like to urge you not to delay the completion of the major cycle routes as proposed in the draft plan now I could tell you all about the extensive benefits of building safe cycling infrastructure such as reduced traffic congestion reduced roading costs reduced pollution and I could show you the obvious demand for getting now but you already know all this stuff you know you know the numbers you know that this network is a great investment for our city and um this plan you 're still proposing to delay completion of the network from 2021 to 2028 so I 'm just going to tell you my story my own story because I think it 's important that you hear about the impact of this proposed delay on individuals and families in communities so I live in the heat Capelli and that 's a great place to look we love it there but if you want to get out of heat get by bike you 've got it you 've got some problems I work in Lincoln my wife works no power my kids go to school or no power and we have one car so yeah we 've got problems my wife and kids travel to school every day you know often by bike the only route out of the heath Capelli and net Direction is along port hiljaa Road which carries very Pyland was a very large tracks to and from going faster that 's the speed limit just gonna fifty to sixty along the road it 's far too dangerous records to bike only about five and seven years old there 's no way right there but a road so we carried them on our cargo bike which is great it works but it 's a really nerve-racking journey for us so there 's no separation from the traffic there 's trucks and cars often passing extremely close in fact there 's one section along there where my wife says okay kids and wave them around she 's worried they probably won 't there 's probably an exaggeration but she feels safer along it but that but she knows that now despite these dangers were staunchly a one-car family and were determined to keep cycling it 's cheaper it 's healthier it 's better for the environment and it 's more fun than driving our car and it 's safe enough just for confident experienced and own cyclists it 's definitely not an option for children so we were really excited to see the plans for their proposed Heath expressway route pretty much all the way from home to school when it 's finished we 've been watching progress we 've been telling the kids you know next year you 'll be able to bike to school once it 's finished and then the long-term plan came out and we were just pretty devastated to see that and the proposed plan completion of this will be delayed until 26 27 eight more years kids and it 's not just our family I mean this is our story but it 's it 's not just us everyone living in Heath get has to cycle alongside here be traffic on either port hills Road or Theory Road if they want to bike anywhere in the city now so children grow they 're gonna get easier and we 're not gonna be able to carry them around on our bike anymore so if there 's still no safe way for them to bike on their own that 's probably gonna mean buying a second car for us I mean not only we 're gonna use our car lease and start slightly more we just it 's pretty crazy I mean it 's not it 's not more there 's not even the same number of cars on the road it 's more cars on the road that 's that 's a terrible outcome for us for our city and for our environment so this is my story and I 'm absolutely not alone in this there 's many people families and communities who will benefit hugely through the development the major cycle routes and just please don 't delay construction on this on these cycle routes build them now before another generation of children safety thanks again and thank you well it 's pretty much to the end of time so look thank you very much for making your submission we have a number of challenges around those the state highway network that comes through our city so we do need to give that some consideration at the same time as considering our LTP so thank you very much _"

    "text": "Dora way my name 's Bree good morning I 'd like to thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak to my personal submission on the Christchurch City Council 19 plan I was motivated by ref Monti when he came and spoke to the Tuesday club and asked us to think about what we wanted Christ used to be like in ten years time so what would my vision for Christchurch be when I turned 70 is most of you at the table know I am an inner city resident I have lived within the foreva news since 2002 when I previously lived in crisis as a student I was also an inner city resident I passionately believe that Christchurch has the potential to be the most livable inner city in the world when I returned from living and working overseas I consciously chose Christchurch to be my home I know that for many decades the City Council has been supporting and proposing great sustainability initiatives during sheer an idea the residents of our city also reinforced their desire for Christchurch to be a green city I 've chosen personal submission today livability of the inner city during my extensive google research on livability the consistent results were infrastructure and public transport my written submission I 've mentioned two aspects of infrastructure that are dear to my heart ample access to clean safe non-chlorinated drinking water and future-proofed green waste treatment however the thing at the top of my list for a livable inner-city careless lifestyle is really good public transport I hear lots of people talking about how we need to limit the number of cars that come into the city bringing workers and shoppers and people wanting to be entertained however I do not hear anything about the transportation options for the large portion of 20,000 inner city residents that will be expected to be careless by 2029 I 'm very fortunate that I love and work in the inner city I live in Salisbury Street wicked Art Institute this is prompting me to choose to become a Carles household in the last nine months since I started wickeder I have embraced the bus system I 'm very impressed with the number of bus routes that can leaving the inner city by bus to visit my various far know friends and organizations that I belong to to see how easy it can be at present I can take the bus to visit Toa mojado tik and run you were held on Stevenson and whis Melton Yvette counts Lewis and rocky and the New Brighton surf club we 're on a superficial with David East however I cannot get to see my friends come Hamilton or Vicky Ratna that title or bf superficial that Taylor 's mistake or by kuku or a tent night aho event set to a he we unless I use a car I 'm very aware that it is II can and not the City Council who currently operate the public transport system but I 'm also very aware that the future of some of the bus routes that I will want to use to visit my friends such as we smelt and unwrapped our key are in question your response to me might be that I could walk cycle use a motorbike yep and uber will rent a new go each year car to you all today is that in 10 years time we have a liveable inner city where its residents can choose to be careless but still be able to remain connected to their far no friends and organizations by using public transport my proposal is at the city council has a genuine desire to reduce the number of cars that live all Park Ananda City then it needs to invest in and encourage the use of the public transport to be able to achieve this it needs to have control over the operation of the public transport system to ensure it meets the needs of its residents meaning of the green goals of the residents of Christchurch desire start with having an extensive and comprehensive public transport system so again my simple plea to you all today is that in 10 years time and a City residents can choose to be careless and still be connected to their far no friends in organizations and the Greater Christchurch region by having access to an extensive and comprehensive public transport network the inner city shuttle that we used to have in the 's um do you think the city 's in a place where it could have that back I would like to see that as far as I know every inner city residents group every time there 's been an opportunity have all collectively lobbied for them and prior to the quake I made extensive use of that shuttle and every time I would do a submission and that he came people what can be can say oh but it 's too expensive to run and I said I 'm happy to pay the point of having access to an inner city shuttle but this plea for me was I think I 've got a lot of good and will here hopefully when the shuttle comes back use of that around the inner city but I want to be able to connect back into my phone oh and the other organizations and and the fact that he can is now saying oh it 's too expensive to go to rap lucky and it 's still expensive to go to West Milton I could end up being stuck in a city with you we certainly submitted on that he can as well so hopefully we 'll get a good result out of the presentations that we 've made in that forum so thank you very much Dora it 's great to see you again thank you _"

    "text": "the first submitter hasn 't arrived yet so we 'll move straight to Jane Buckland we got to come forward thank you okay absolutely straight untidy thanks for having me the opportunity to speak so I 'm talking on the differential rates policy in particular to remote rural properties a remote rural property gets a 25 business 25 percent discount off the general rate levy while a standard pays 100 percent in business 168 PC so a brief description of our remote rural property as anything that 's rural or residential in the district plan and as outside the service area and a solely well principally used for air court pastoral forestry bees poultry or vacant land the council policy also states that any rural property that is used primarily for residential purposes will not qualify for the lower rural differential it 's this statement that seems to create difficulty because qualification depends on council rates staff having to make a subjective assessment about whether the primary use of the property as rural or incidental so a bit of history as to me being here so I built a house rates invoice came and I noticed or unless it was classed as residential rural residential so I questioned there as I was a fully operational deer breeding unit and later moved to beef and horticulture I was told that there was a cryptic class I assume that all properties and my neighboring area were the same is some had minimal to no activity on them first 14 years I noticed that I was paying approximately 2 K more a year and my rates than the other 22 properties along my area except for one other one that was built in the same year as mine so over that period of time I 've been living there that 's about 35 K extra so it appears who sit on the determination seat saw it different than any before them or after them at that time so I started to look a bit further into the policy itself and its length clarity consistency transparency and application bud staffed us with its administration became apparent so I asked again and the same answer came back focusing particularly on my land so I looked Westmoreland and I found there of the five acre blocks and a ten percent of them were classed as rural residential the City Council 's staff then opted to come out and do an on-site assessment just despite me saying to them there that was the policy I was questioning not my property and they 've I had no stock at the time because the current the City Council were currently using one of my largest paddocks while they built a water retention facility adjacent to my property while they 're on site asks what criteria is used to determine primary use as a stock he counts per area bearing in mind that there are industry standards crop yields or income etc and could they give me some examples so I could have a clear understanding response I also asked what method is used processing properties as a drone site deserts or Google Earth during this period I agreed to the City Council positioning an easement on my land that saves them 35 K and access to the water attention facility for the for the added duration of it life measurable criteria that I 've seen in the policy was a percentage of the overall land juice that has been set aside for residential use so I wrote to the council staff requesting examples of the working calculations the process that 's used to determine classifications and the process for monitoring change of use so if a property chains changes hands or the owners changed the use honor at that point I got a letter from the senior legal adviser respondent saying that there would be no more communication about my property is seized and sufficient oral activity I went back and I said he actually asked the staff whether they weren 't able to answer the questions about the policy itself which rules fairly fair and reasonable thing dr. Carlin earbuds wrote saying that I 'm not to camp context off anymore on Christians must go through the official information Xing Act which once again with the focus being on my property rather than addressing the questions related to the pole say let 's respect these reactions highlight how the policy leaks clear guidelines for staff to be able and transparent manner without the use of subject to persist them the short of us of it is that when comparing properties of similar size and uses no rhyme or reason evident for the classifications awarded on both rural rural in rural residential is the whole raft of property setups in regard to land use level of activity connected to this town services size of house shape of property property layout and etc and 2016 the City Council said about systematically contacting properties on the list of five acres examples I provided them notifying them that they were changing from rural to resident from residential sorry rural Theresa intial some that responded was you prove we 're not rural never heard back and have maintained their rural status despite in cases some land being unsuitable of for any form of horticultural way agricultural use over several months of the year before we have a policy that has no clear measurable criteria which makes it impossible for staff to apply it with uni degree of consistency and transparency and would be incredibly time consuming if it was administered properly the ratepayers they charge what they are they shouldn 't be a smoke and mirrors approach taken by the staff who are tasked with making decisions from a policy there is no clear criteria and therefore cannot be applied in a democratic fear inconsistent way Jane look thank you I mean it we 've come to the end of the five minutes I can see that you 've got a substantial document that you 're reading from I 've asked for them to put it on the hub so that all councillors can see the full amount and obviously in the submission that you 've seen through to us we didn 't have visibility of the that this sort of kind of the background issue so if it 's from so we 're hearing that for the first time and obviously we 've all got a number of questions in relation to that but we 're going to have to move on to the next submitter pick so but we will get that and I assure you we will read it and we will look at your individual case as well as the bigger picture question okay thank you _"

example significantly greater than they are for others so thank you very much Claire does anyone have any questions I think you 've made a powerful presentation so thank you for doing so and thank you you 've given us some things that we need to be thinking about thank you I expect sure most of you had to listen to that not my slides cross-eyed exceed do you know the torture programs when I know the 1920 it 's a minute allow me to say perfect timing thank you at page 96 on your submissions welcome hi green means go doesn 't_''_131.569 so yes it does I am representing Danny more Holdings who undertaking the Westmoreland just development the the hill down to some of the final stages effect now they supported their counselors proposed works beckon 16 I think it was to do the lights it 's Paul 's Weasley 's who named Kashmir Road they time that the road cones were actually out be out now in work starting and so I was surprised to find that it had been pushed out to I think that plans near to the 2019 20 financial year they feel that the probe problems with this intersection that encouraged the council to bring the funding forward in the first place can be years or so ago I still just as relevant now and then but they would prefer not to see the delay okay it 's very straightforward anyone 's got any questions tell me I mean I know what to must say but I couldn 't agree more I know I 'm just trying to find but anyway okay in terms of no reason given so have you contacted council staff or of council staff contacted you just say that it 's been delayed yes we were because we may have made a submission the engagement staff contacted us and March this year to advise us that it was going to be delayed from from when it was and there was there the comment was that the funding pushed push just a little perplexed there was nothing specific as to why other than we assume it 's a juggling of projects right but I 'm just my staff contacted you originally was it cuz you made this omission last year we made a submission when the the design works were put out all right so the designs or anything consulted on agreed consult on agreed so at the time it was expected that they would be starting construction man when they did that consultation and yeah I think the original decision was around the opening of their crash it should Benja Park and then since which time we 've had the Port Hills fire and damage to their infrastructure and so it 's a proposal at the stage to delay it as part of the draft LTP so you 're saying no it needs to go ahead now anyway yes yes okay thank you very much for your submission much appreciated thank you thank you right well apparently we 're a bit of time and we 've got one more to go which is the East Lake trust gonna get him by five he 's gonna get here by five so if you want to take 15 minutes we 'll just talk about yourself or just adjourn the meeting until five o 'clock thank you you thank you for coming in early I 'm it 's almost gobsmacking Lee unbelievable that we 're running ahead of time so it just doesn 't happen so it had to happen on this occasion so thank you Thank You councilman spear for giving us this opportunity to speak I 've been told that I should keep it brief and our time for questions so I will keep it very brief essential submission is that provision should be made in the LTP for the lake that nothing is done to preclude the possibility of the lake it 's not something that needs to be built today tomorrow we know that we 'll be lucky to have cycleways or all parkways you know within five years so this is a long-term project I think we should make a decision now as we say we generate here that it 's going to preclude something it 's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity this is a multi-purpose Lake it 's not just about rowing it 's about dragon boating kayaking open water swimming rowing triathlon waka ama and we think that the reasons provided by regenerate to date don 't make a lot of sense we 've consulted with regenerate over the last three years we have talked to them about numerous issues in minut detail largely to do with cost we even argued about the size of the stones that would be the armoring of the side of the lake that 's saw the detail we got into but we never once talked about being a problem but now of you will use this and 3% of the Ecuador available we never once talked about wetlands space the wetlands we certainly talked about the need for wetlands we 've provided plans for wetlands and as you can see from our plan is this that deals with a good 16 hectares but there 's room for the 31 that they require we never once talked about the release of water from the river rather from the lake into release of water from the lake into the river can be managed in such a way as that it will augment the flow when minimum flow and an addition can be held by flow medicating the erosion the lake has proved extremely popular as a as a submission issue maybe where there 's over 65% of the submission and regenerates own consultation last year we 're in support of a lake of some shape or form that 's out of 1800 possible submissions since the decision that regenerate to dump the lake from the exhibition we stand the petition which is now just on 4,000 petitioners in about four days and it 's building and building and building we 're going to be actively promoting the lake we 're not going to give up yeah I think about the cricket pavilion we mean we nearly lost their amazing facility we now have an igloo park you all saw the television coverage of the English test amazing is it for Christchurch we nearly lost it because of a few militant people similar thing is happening now we need to be we to the council having significantly shortened my submission is I think the council needs to show leadership here ask the question why what happened this life was on the books it was going to make the exhibition for all money and then suddenly got chopped off what happened were you properly consulted what changed has a vision expectation being met they actually undertaken proper feasibility on this visit appropriate to knock out such a key part of a potential plan at such an early stage before the minister isn 't even has an opportunity to make a decision a number of issues rise I was remiss I didn 't introduce Sophie strong who 's a landscape designer architect and it can help any questions on wetlands ellen ratner is a hydrologist who can help with all the issues dealing with aquifer water I also have Nathan pond with me some of you may recognize a New Zealand gold medalist in the 2012 Olympics in Nathan I think we just want Mason to talk to the community aspect of similar lakes over in Europe and in the Northern Hemisphere and particularly just training and rowing on the lake so they thinking councillors thank you for the opportunity to come along and I guess speaking terms of some of the benefits of these like trust August for me avi I 've had a direct relationship with some of these lakes in the water global sort of scheme of things but I thought rather focus on like some of the water benefits eating the seeds of the community some of these other overseas locations that have these lakes now obviously there is a trick benefit to I guess all flat water sports our business has been well documented and the process of getting to this stage but I think there 's also bigger benefit to society more than just the water sport users that will be using the lake directly now I guess I 've been very fortunate that 's been considerable time each year training and living in there so I 'm very similar venues they 're like like these it 's like sort of proposed overseas there 's couple ones that I 'll focus on very briefly here so this is central Amsterdam and the Netherlands there 's pausing and Poland there so in the city did I 've got a bit similar like that 's about five minutes from the city centre and then a bit to the lesser extend is dawning light and eaten just outside of London as well jewel berries somewhere I guess likes the one that 's proposed by the East Lake trust I guess the things that strike me most about some of these venues is probably the large amount of non water support users that these lakes attract now to give me an example generally when you 're out training early in the morning and the lights are there now there 's plenty and people were up for the morning walk with their morning run around the lake you know if even 's like to rollerblading and I guess all different forms of exercise they 're here sometimes I like becomes a bit of a focal point so generate I guess point of you know health and recreation probably you know during the day you 'll see many people whether it 's a lunch quickly and like that and then probably one of the more pleasing things you see is generally on weekends and like that especially probably more on summer time there 's a lot of like families out having picnics or you know just kids out playing around the later that sort of comes a bit of a center point for the community to sort of meet and probably get up so they outdoors and that 's something you start seeing a lot is that sometimes the actual people actually on the lake far outnumber by the people using the surrounding lake for obvious a whole lot of more engaging activities rather than just drink water support use I guess into addition let generally when you 've got a I guess a lake or a focal point that of making place off the community is that generally attracts I guess things like local cafes and restaurants that especially in the weekends you see a generally really busy you know just a lot of people and society now like having their coffee or lunch whatever overlooking water war I 'm just sort of of the laid users around there you know like I think you know you look at this I know there is direct benefits to the water sport users but I think you know the far bit of like a benefit to the community is probably more that it becomes a central point of I guess connection for the local community and recent encourages people to socialize and engage in the outdoors and you know there 's also play so I guess children to play and a safe and secure way so that 's probably just a brief overview I 'm more than happy to elaborate further jurgis on any experience I 've had with some of the lakes over Cesar for quite thank you for your time thank you sorry Aaron just to two quick questions just as we hit along one that the public want to know can you hold an international event on this was this a training link I know you can 't hold it at full international event on the East Lake yes so we 've built it to its two point two two point one so it 'll be thesis pick international speak obviously so our viewers always do the lady should do it full size so you can hold international events is to the literary expectation though viewers that you wouldn 't in terms of the surrounding infrastructure you know shields buildings etc you might do that over time so you sort of build the lake and then the greenery the landscaping all the extra sometime over time but and is this also the facility that would bring Lisa Carrington to town to compete better get a crowd yes while we have we have Nathan here who 's obviously very well known gold medalist the whole point is that it 's multi-purpose so it 's canoeing kayaking iron men so you know the wanaka Ryan man brings in six money in just on a weekend a Mardi cap has seven million you know so under peanut report Deloitte is to make twenty to thirty million per annum and its economic impact which is basically motels hotels restaurants you know it 's not a concession business you don 't pay a ticket to go in bridge of peace in the night that 's what I understood so then the benefits are enormous it 's not unlike you had the stadium argument I 'm Tim felt a on so sorry now they 're going away from the lease from yourself in the competition I mean one of the keys for me would be that this would be open to the community so family could take the you know place that kayak or whatever they got from Bunnings and come down and just have a picnic and just play around on this so that that 's it boats into the spectrum is it right so transport what you see in situations like that overseas a little bit of this generally like a times like this to be close if there was like super major international Gators were large-scale Gators but generally what you do only finds women with training on the lakes on a daily basis they generally boy them out into different segments of the lake so you might have three or four lanes which other four I guess you know kayaking or roaring white so might be a recreational use area that sometimes it might be for swim it might be for like you said general community just play around and that 's telling me that essentially boy it off into a safe zone so in that way you don 't hit that oncoming I guess you know rowing boats were quite it moved quite fast over water giving the way of swimmers will see puree recreation we use this idea to generally what I 've seen is probably works best is when there is a secret you really we 're imagining that the sort of birth of the walk that in psycho ways that connect their you know the city to the sea so two speakers those walkways will go past the lake and there 'll be picnic areas stopping areas there the majesty people that want to go there in the weekend you know with their family and the dog would either so it 's it 's it 's the reason this is about regenerating the East of Christchurch the red zone in a good idea to do that is there like you go here do you want to do it out in the sticks Mel and I go well nice idea but no because this on the redesign you know this is about the red zone and regeneration is about people you know flex bushes in wetlands oh great but you know how many people visit the Trevor sweetly it 's I love the Travis sweet beans but you know I 'd like to know what the numbers are you know nature walks are fantastic but I need to make sure you need some participation I walk around the Travis Wheatley it 's a lot I 'm one of the patrons just saying coming today can I just ask you just like there 's been a number of reasons given as to why the the flat water lake hasn 't been included as project and the red zone well it 's wondering if you can perhaps tell us your view of what you understand or help me understand anyway what the primary or actual reason is that it 's not hasn 't_''_2265.46 been included well and we the media at least gave three reasons and I think we all know those three reasons it 's one that somehow there 's an implication that we all contact on for water there 's too much aquifer water will be taken we 'll be taking about 46 million cubic meters a year the total water available I think is 480 million Helen if I got that right yeah you don 't actually know how much is the modeling is about 480 million so it 's 3% so we dispute the first reason the second reason is that they need the area where the Lakers pull wetlands the wetlands to assist Horseshoe Lake with you know improving the quality of the stormwater our viewers there 's plenty of room for wetlands and around the lake and other areas and also there are more efficient ways to clean stormwater lens and so you 'll see to the to the right of the lake was actually what we call an algae scrubber which is sort of long it looks like a stream or a lake on the right hand side where the water can pass over and be different ways that you can achieve the same means more efficiently the last reason given is that because it 's an active feed lake and you need to turn the water over every 40 days and release the water into the river that the half human will go into the river will cause erosion through the additional water flight so we 're talking the you know the red bridge fly think of the river is about two qmix that 's an extra 25 per seat we 're saying firstly that 's not a significant increase because to cue mix isn 't going to be silly cause erosion it gets up to 17 and a high flood event and we 're saying secondly the lakes like a big bath you can you can you know let the water out it pull the plug anytime so if it was particularly low you could actually release water to raise the minimum flow and effect I 'm involved in a dam project and Nelson where the whole purpose is to release water in low flow means to increase flow and equally if it 's on to the water a bit longer so you can manage it so David of those reasons aren 't valid can you tell us what else look well this is where there 's been some controversy and you would have read the article in the briefs at a recent meeting Howard I think on Tuesday organized by Sport Canterbury Ivan I fita Vindicator three reasons given word sort of to use those words the real reasons or words to that effect people here at that meeting who can cooperate what occurred that they were the reasons simply I suppose that the public would understand there 's some confusion is to exactly what was meant long and short is that those are the three reasons but also there 's land use criteria so they refer the decision was based on the land use criteria which if you dig into the bowels of the regenerate website you 'll find and it 's awaiting analysis they would have applied weighted land use assessment which includes cultural and social well-being and we say that we would score very highly on that because of the the aquifer water being released the environmental enhancement again we think we would score highly on it for the water quality improvement a speaks affordability in investment this is really around activation public funding citro we can see that this the benefit is a bit like the stadium its economic benefit the twenty or thirty million a year you know you 're not gonna be so to put money and get a return it doesn 't work that way visualization activation which is people arriving visitors hotel big nights travelers we think we 're a five out of five on that one accessibility they 're getting the community involved peddling swimming we think we 're a five out of five on that connectivity connecting you know the city to the sea well will be a major attraction along the cycleway walkway so we think we 're a four or five out of there and in the other one employment an economic activity well you know between 2010 des sorry tweeters through the money in a year again that 's people working in restaurants per house speaks for itself achieve aborn is feasible and as deliverable so it 's feasible it 's deliverable you know money is obviously an issue but you know I 've been in so many meetings with regenerate and a Tucker I said look if there 's no money tell me now because I 've been working on this for three or four years and you 're all busy we 're volunteers you know there 's no money tell us now and they 've always said swear on the Bible money is not the problem you need to assess whether it 's feasible that money is the next question so you know we very disappointed with the decision made it makes no sense whatsoever the reasons given were not indicated or we were early in a consultation we 've had no opportunity to respond to those reasons those technical reasons with very completely messages and we feel that the council I suspect and you probably can 't comment are just as surprised as we are with this decision we wonder when the ministers surprised as well so I think we need to start asking some questions look and presenting to us this evening we understand the process that we 're in at the moment but I know that it was valuable for the councillors to hear your views so thank you very much for coming thank you right I now adjourn this meeting until 10 o 'clock on Saturday morning sorry about that team but you _"

we just want Mason to talk to the community aspect of similar lakes over in Europe and in the Northern Hemisphere and particular to benefit that he 's observed to the local community just training and

some of these lakes in the water global sort of scheme of things but I thought rather focus on some of the water benefits each english seat of the community some of these other overseas locations that

very similar venues they 're like like these it 's like sort of proposed overseas and there 's couple ones that I 'll focus on very briefly here so this is a Baz bone lake which is about 10 minutes from central inciden and the netherlands there 's pausing and polling there so in the city did i from the city centre and then a bit to the lesser extent is dawning light and a turn just outside of

central point of I guess connection for the local community and recent encourages people to socialize and engage in the outdoors and you know there 's also play so I guess children to play and a safe and secure way so yeah that 's probably just a brief overview I 'm more than happy to elaborate further Jurgis on any experience I 've had with some of the lakes over Cesar for quite thank you for your time thank you sorry Erin just to two quick questions just as we hit along one that the public want to know can you hold an international event on this was this a training link I know you can 't hold it at full international event on this lake yes so we 've built it to its 2.2 2.5 meters long so it 's 2,000 with runoff so it 'll be thesis speak international speak obviously so our viewers always do the lake should do it full size so you can hold international events is Pierre the leader of the surrounding infrastructure you know Sheen 's buildings etc you might have do that over time so you sort of build the lake and then the greenery the landscaping all the extra time overtime but and is this also the facility that would bring Lisa Carrington to town to compete there to get a crowd yes while we have we have Nathan here who 's obviously very well known gold medalist the whole point is that it 's multi-purpose so it 's canoeing kayaking ironmen so you know the wanna cryin man brings in six money in just in a weekend a Mardi cap has seven million you know so under peanut rapport Deloitte is to make twenty to thirty million per annum and its economic impact which is basically motels hotels restaurants you know it 's not a concession business you don 't pay a ticket to go in but all the supporters need to do things so average of 2 per person tonight that 's what I understood so then the benefits are enormous it 's not unlike you know the stadium argument and Tim felt yawn sorry the competition I mean one of the keys for me would be that this would be open to the community so family could take the you know place that kayak or whatever they got from Bunnings and come down and just have a picnic and just play around on this so that that 's it bites into the spectrum was it right so generally trust but what you see in situations like that overseas a little bit of this generally like a times like this to be close if there was like super median international food Gators were large-scale Gators but generally what you generally finds women with training on the lakes on a day to day basis they generally boy them they are in two different segments of the lake so you might have three or four lanes which other four I guess you know kayaking or rowing white so that need to fall part of Lake and then there might be a recreational use area that sometimes it might be for swim it might be for like you said general community just to play around and that 's so in that way you don 't hit that I 'm coming I guess uh you know rowing boats with kites it moved quite fast over water getting the way of swimmers will see surely recreation we use aside it 's generally what I 've seen has probably works best is when there is a separate your omelet we 're imagining that the sort of the walk that in psycho ways that connect their you know the city to the sea so two speakers those walkways will go past the lake and there will be picnic areas stopping areas in the majesty people who want to go there in the weekend you know with their family and the dog would eat us so it 's it 's it 's the reason this is about regenerating the East of Christchurch the red zone and a good idea to do that is they 're like you know I get phone calls saying if this doesn 't go here do you want to do it and it sticks smell and I go well nice idea but no because there 's not in the and regenerations about people you know flex bushes and wetlands are great but you know how many people visit the Trevor sweetly its pile of the Travis sweet beans but you know I 'd like to know what the numbers are you know nature walks are fantastic but to make sure you need some participation I walk around the Travis Wheatley it 's a lot I 'm one of the patrons just saying coming today can I just ask you just like there 's been a number of reasons given as to why the the flat water lake hasn 't been included as project and the red zone we 're just wondering if you can perhaps tell us your view of what you understand or help me understand anyway what the primary or actual reason is that it 's not hasn 't_''_745.45 been included well and we have media at least gave three reasons and I understand that the council were given three reasons and I think we all know those three reasons it 's one that we will somehow there 's an implication that we all compact on it taken and Helen can probably speak to me we 'll be taking about 46 million cubic meters a year the total water available I think is 480 million alone if I got that right yeah you don 't actually know how much as even the modeling is about 480 million so it 's 3% so we dispute the first reason the second reason is that they need the area where the Lakers for wetlands the wetlands to assist Horseshoe Lake with you know improving the quality of the stormwater our viewers there 's plenty of room for wetlands and around the lake and other areas and also there are more efficient ways to clean stormwater so you 'll see to the to the right of the lake there 's actually what we call an algae scrubber which is sort of a long it looks like a stream or a lake on the right hand side where the water can pass over and be cleaned by by algae so that there are lots of different ways that you can achieve the same means more efficiently the last reason given is that to turn the water over every 40 days and release the water unto the river that the half human will go into the river will cause erosion through the additional water flow so we 're talking the the you know the Reverend think of the river is about two qmix that 's an extra 25 per seat we 're saying fiercely that 's not a significant increase because to qmix isn 't going to be cause erosion it gets up to 17 and a high flood event and we 're saying secondly the lakes like a big bath you can you can you know let the water out pull the plug anytime so if it was particularly low you could actually release water to raise the minimum flow in effect I 'm involved in a dam project and Nelson where the whole purpose is to release water in low flow events to increase flow and equally if it 's very high flow or there are problems you just hang on to the water a bit longer so you can manage it so David those reasons aren 't valid can you 's been some controversy and you would have read the article in the briefs at a recent meeting Howard I think I 'm choosy organized by sport Canterbury Ivan aya fita vindicated three reasons given word sort of to use this words the real reasons or words to that effect people here at that meeting who can cooperate what occurred that they were the reasons simply I suppose that the public would understand there 's some confusion is to exactly what was meant long on the short is that those are the three reasons but also there 's land use criteria so they refer the decision was based on the land use criteria which if you dig into the bowels of the regenerate website you will find and it 's awaiting analysis weighted land use assessment which includes cultural and social well-being and we say that we would score very highly on that because of the ability to dilute and clean horseshoe lake and river through the aquifer water being released the environmental enhancement again we think we would score highly on it for the water quality improvement aspects affordability we can see that the benefit is a bit like the stadium its economic benefit the twenty or thirty million the year you know you 're not going to investor to put money and get a return it doesn 't work that way visualization activation which is people arriving visitors hotel beard nights travelers we think we 're a five out of five on that one accessibility they 're getting the community involved peddling swimming we think we 're a five out of five on that connectivity connecting you know the city to the sea well will be a major attraction along the cycleway walkways so we think we 're a four or five out of there and then the other one employment and economic activity well you know between 28 Indo sorry tweezers to the money in a year again that 's people working in restaurants bars speaks for itself achieve aboard livable well it 's been regenerated agree that the project is feasible and it 's deliverable so it 's feasible it 's deliverable you know money is obviously an issue but you know I 've been in there 's no money tell me now because I 've been working on this for three or four years and you 're all busy we 're volunteers you know there 's no money tell us now and they 've always said swear on the Bible money is not the problem you need to assess whether it 's feasible that our money is the next question so you know we very disappointed with the decision made it makes no sense whatsoever the reasons given were not indicated we were early in a consultation had no opportunity to respond to those reasons those technical reasons with very completely messages and we feel that the council I suspect and you probably can 't comment are just as surprised as we are with this decision we wonder when the ministers surprised as well so thank you very much for as I say coming in and presenting to us this evening we understand the process that we run at the moment but I know that it was valuable for the councillors to hear your views so thank you very much for coming thank you right Saturday morning sorry about that team that _"

    "text": "[Music] who 's Andrew Everest Apple commercial limiters good afternoon and welcome afternoon mayor councillors I owned the property at the top end of my rocky road which was recently resigned industrial and I come here today with the money-making scheme rather than asking you for money late in the day that might be present present present relief for you by way of background you 'll recall after youth quakes the three areas of land up near the airport were grouped under what was called the northwest review area one was at the rusty Road Waimakariri Road which is to be rezoned to industrial that didn 't proceed but I think there 's now subject to a private change for a car transfer company trying to develop that into industrial block the second block was orphaned in Road rusty Road Haven head which caused a lot of angst for those property owners and you may recall that the council achieve in the end granted a rate relief for the years 2014 to 2016 as 2017 and the report I have just from stuff mentions that the the only Johansen mentioned an extraordinary circumstance but the council decided to wouldn 't seem president president for rates rebates but that there had been some difficulty with the rezoning that particular block of land and whether it would go here or not in the end it didn 't go ahead the third block is the block that you have the front of you there which is why rocky road Stanley 's Road and wall would just road which did get zoned wairakei industrial park and I owned a block on my rocky road now the difficulty with us has been that when the rates were set the details of the district scheme had not been finalized so that the impediments to development were not clear at the time the rates were set so on my particular block of hectares the 2012 rates when it was owned rural were 1943 this year 's rates as industrial at twenty one thousand five hundred and ninety two and and there are others obviously that have difficulties hurdle versus were in terms of meeting those rate payments are not quite in that position the yeah just scroll included in this the details from the district scheme of permitted activities except remoter than are quite straightforward but there 's a nick a grave concern it 's an equitable because what happens is the did you just go past it though the main one there 's two there 's one on on roading right but the major one is whoops shortly before this block of land was zoned industrial the airport made a submission to the council with regard to what they call a private is a private sewer that runs down Wairakei Road as I understand that the airport said well we need all that capacity for development of the airport industrial area there was a trade-off in the zoning and that whereas previously the airport had to have resource consent if the developments that they did were not airport related that was lifted so though they can do any industrial activity but this block that I 'm referring to that Armour owner now has a major impediment and it says no activity on this industrial block of land shall discharge into the reticulated wastewater network until the ton interceptor sewer to provide capacity to accommodate wastewater flows from the industrial park zone wairakei road into the why rocky road collect a sewer so effectively rates being charged on dusty land which cannot be developed into least two and told us to intercept stations have been upgraded this stage as far as I can see there 's no provision for any upgrade of these now there are it 's real interest in developing this property not just for me I 've had unsolicited offers to buy from developers but when they start digging into the scheme and find that they can 't do anything with it naturally if they go cold so there is real demand because where 's the airport land is counted the airport will continue to own it and lease it back these are people who want to have their own freehold development in this side of town there 's other leasehold became time property on the far side of rusty Road but this is really the only freehold opportunity so my request is that the upgrade on those interceptors be done urgently to enable contributions and all the other funds that flow from a good industrial development in their area of town the alternative will be I 'm sure when the next valuation 2019 that the valuation people will have to be having another look at the values I did abject to the last one in 2013 on the basis that it was more whispered that it was going to go industrial I withdrew that because it is time we buy it became quite clear that the council supported becoming industrial and that was the case so the 2016 that we end up I think it 's fairly not six and a half million dollars right sir as I say 21 and a half thousand we can 't do anything whether it love to do something with it hmm and there 's strong interest in acquiring the property and developing us I 'm just asking that this that sector of the work of course is roading work and other bits and pieces that would follow normally as with any ordinary industrial development but the sewage thing is outside there so that 's my submission for bringing it to our attention on it 's always helpful to quote Jana you know and your submission as well so but that deals that would deal only with a rebate it doesn 't actually deal with the big picture issue which is to allow the development to proceed which requires us so we 'll get some details on that so thank you very much for drawing it to our attention thank you very much okay _"

    "text": "next is the Christchurch progressive Network John Montone h-12 seven welcome oh well thank you very much um this is um self John Miko from the progressive network and Sheena Dixon here who works in East of Christchurch among families in desperate need of rental housing so a submission here is very you know very simple and straightforward we were just saying to the council that we think the drafted long term plan has got its priorities wrong quite seriously wrong and it seems to us that like around this round this council program there 's a lot of people who have we 've quite genuine concerns about families struggling with cousin either people living living room or you know two or three families to a house families living in garages and bands and all kinds of places and Sheena can talk about that in a minute the actual the direct experience that she has with people in those those situation and yet despite that despite you know and anticipate having a long history here in Christchurch all of strong support for families on on low and medium incomes through seems that somehow this issues kind of just been lost and you know we 've the council I think lost it over 400 houses through that through the earthquakes 400 council rental properties through the earthquakes and those numbers have simply not been made up and it 's to me that is the issue is where you know at one level issues where is the money because it seems to me that if the council at four hundred houses destroyed in the earthquakes then there 's a massive insurance payout for that and yet with the global insurance money that 's come in some it just seems to me from the outside that that some somewhere within council there 's been money shifted around on balance sheets so that that money is somehow not available to repeal the housing that 's been lost and it seems to me that the seems to us that this really is there 's an ethical and moral question here they 're these houses are needed now even more than they were needed before the earthquakes New Zealand and Christchurch is in a housing crisis 't have well connected homeless people well-connected struggling families like we do for example the rugby union you made a presentation a few days ago you know well-connected people it seems to me in particular with with the state well connected people have kind of pushed their way through people who aren 't here you 're not going to get you know a number of homeless people or people are absolutely struggling coming to present to the council because they 're not that well-connected they 're not connected to power structures that exist so therefore it 's really I think incumbent on the people in this room to actually make up that that deficit and that power deficit if you like and put some real um behind getting the council housing up to standard as I said before this you know before the earthquakes we didn 't have the housing crisis we have now so the situation is worse and yet the council has got fewer houses that doesn 't make sense to me so so I think that really that 's what we 're presenting to you today this think it 's good enough to say well we 're gonna put this issue with the object a housing trust community hasn 't chosen because all of us in this room know that that Housing Trust does not have the resources to rebuild the houses that are needed desperately in the city yes they put out a their own plan for for developing the number of houses but that 's over ten years and it still won 't get to where the council was before the earthquakes is that there 's this moral hole in the ten-year plan and I think that needs to be addressed between now and the time that the the long-term plan is is finalized so she needs you I 'm assuming you 've all heard the the paper I 'm going to talk to item three it talks at the bottom here of the amount of people living in cars Ryan 's comments that session I talk from my own experience I 'm Minister in East Christchurch and I walk alongside people who have been living in cars caravan than every other thing you can shacks just a little while ago the council put out a paper asked us who are in the and Emilia to let you know if we find someone that was sleeping rough well I spoke to the people that I walk alongside and know fairly well and I wanted them their permission to give those you know perhaps not their names well I was hoping they would give their names but no but they said you can do it she never what 's the point so they 've lost hope some of them are struggling they don 't have the confidence to come in yeah that 's why they speak to people like me you 've got more confidence and it 's good for them I suppose and I 'm here to advocate for those people that are voiceless and yet they 're part of our community and give him a chance if they had a roof over their heads he would become even more part of our community I 'm not a bleeding heart there are some that will not ever or probably not in the short term any but the vast majority would love a roof over their heads and they 're looking to the council and we 're looking to the state provision of housing as well but that 's difficult for them to I can 't sometimes I know I 'm terribly privileged to have roof over my head but I walk alongside these people who do not and I want to be able to look at them and say I 'm doing my very best for you that 's why I 'm here yeah to owed you to bring the housing back up to a pre athlete number please well this way is sort of our community for the people of tawheed Christchurch please do look at the long term plan again and if there 's any way that you can find the necessary resources whatever they may be to bring it up to previous levels please this thank you thank you very much and I mean there 's obviously an councillors will have questions but I just want to comment briefly on the insurance because the global settlement for the housing units was actually that what the housing wasn 't included because it residential properties covered by EQC and actually the small one-bedroom units they didn 't hit the they didn 't hit the hundred thousand for the insurance payout so I 'm just saying that or they lose some but very few that actually reached that level so I 'm just saying they 're two different pots of money I 'd have to say somewhere underinsured in terms of the damage well the type of insurance was challenging so the settlement wasn 't what it should have been and the other thing that I should say is that I think a hundred and fifteen properties were in the red zone and this council was not compensated for any of them signed and the cost-sharing agreement before well three months four months before I was evicted as mere so it is something that we 've got on the table with in terms of a global settlement but it 's just one of many issues that we have on the table so it felt thank you very much for your submission and like we 've around social housing and clearly there 's a huge need that you 've described can I just you also refer to the people are sleeping rough people who are homeless and you might be aware that in fact government are putting in a large amount of money through housing first government have also asked us as a council if we might also support that financially and we 've got a fund called the community resilience partnership fund where housing first funding would would fit I 'm just wondering if you believe in light of all of the need for social housing if that 's an area that err council should also support would you to support her I know of housing first in other countries and how it works and from my own experience that has been fit yeah certainly in the UK and in other places it works that how is that whole hose and first ethos works because it looks at people in a holistic way yeah if I 'm sure you know I 'm not going to reiterate what they 've told you before but it does but it builds a community around them as well which of course it 's what we 're looking we 're all looking to do is build community and be you know there for our communities hmm thank you and on the Christian to say that I mean I I agree with what you said but I think provided that 's not seen as an alternative to the council fronting up to to this issue of this yeah I kind of want to reassure you both that you are not alone and the submissions that you 've been making today there are others who have spoken for those people we have had homeless people come to council in the past to tell their stories which is an incredibly powerful but very brave thing to do to have the courage to come here and speak out so there is a lot of sympathy for the for the points that you 've raised today so thank you very much for your submission thank you very much thank you _"

related to Ellen alderman the new project and we seek an upgrade for historical a quantity which III to be established as important harbour acquaintance we believe that initiative is integral part of the eleanor domain renewal project our community the equine community support group consists of 19 horse owners and riders based in a harbor Basin we have 200 voters who has signed supporters list and this will be provided on a later stage we we also have more than 2000 children annually attending providing programs that live in strength which is based elephant and very often they use facilities adjacent to the area the head letters of support from women harbor school governors based school project Littleton living springs Charlie in home and family project project is initiative is also supported by L&L domain reserve management committee who sees this as the great addition to the existing the Strickland has been designated for horses and homeland of the domain so this is the site of the Ellen Hollister in the rear section which is provides also that planned development been designated for hosts whose training paddock for local children and youth for over 40 years the horse paddock has saved the Harvard community by accommodating recreational riding training and oka competitions since the mainland has fallen into disrepair there is no designated area available in the harbor Basin to accommodate acquired Sport and Recreation the demand for recreation riding in a harbour base has grown considerably in recent times local owners are in renting verdicts for grazing for people from Russia as well as local charities and organizations operating children family and youth sport programs the current renewal project has has covered the area closer to the main hall that toilets Hart Park community hall have been upgraded to the high standard and become available as the community however Allendale domains the parts remain in the considerable disappear there are a few photos taken in this summer and summer was quite dry and we can see that still on the paddocks it 's there is a condition is dysfunctional drainage that keeps the main sport field and horse paddock in very good condition for over over a half for over half of the year second issue that limits the main stage for recreational riding is poor condition in court Eric ground remediation in conjunction with effective drainage would allow community activities to be resumed if these issues if this is to be left unattended it would compromise the quality and ethics of work done so far on Allendale domain renewable project given a level of investment already put in the project and in a work which is not finished it is important to to balance the social and economic benefits from from the of the project their quantum unity offers to upgrade existing horse bedding in over the covered a riding arena such facility would allow to create a little tan Harbor equine hub it would attract riders Aventis trainers not only from the area but from other parts of the Christchurch we believe that this initiative would add value to the main animal product not only that it supports discipline objectives to maintain its uniqueness would create infrastructure for land-based new line based recreational activity it would well connect with existing network of walkways and mountain bike tracks and provide based increasing rural tourism we also believe that this could be multi-purpose riding arena and therefore suitable for various sporting events and community festivals eliminate this gun the various specialists to understand the scope and cost and work involved to complete renewal project if Alton Hagen has done ground assessment we also consulted structural engineers and to find the most cost effective solution for the covered arena we believe that it can be done in a cost-effective wife if we partnered with Christchurch City Council on the project completion if one community has been maintaining and upgrading post-verdict for more than 40 years own efforts all the maintenance have been done by voluntary work and on donations however the further further work is limited because Len where we plan to plan to initiative belong accounts and we would like to partner in this project and see how we can collaborate in as a community we are prepared to also put a put in effort and aspects of the project thank you thank you very much and are there any questions ok thanks very much for your submission it wasn 't clear from your written submission what you were actually seeking were you seeking funding or we seeking X 's and kind of the right to develop the land it would be funding to complete renewal project because subject land what would be then discussing an opposing initiative is part of Elendil doe from the recommendations of the Fulton Hagen that land remediation can be done at 103,000 and that would cover this for the horse paddock and excess wire to the side it didn 't include drainage as cutting drainage there is a three open drains on the on pit on around the Allendale domain but only one is operating when it 's fully blocked that is partially blocked and I would assume that consoles engineered wood would be able to give advise cost upgrade that part did you say that there was already funding on budget for domain drainage and upgrade it sort of says we seek a continuation of funding there is some landscaping in this budget but there is now continuing continuation of the funding for 30 years and this matter hasn 't_''_576.74 been brought to attention before and this is the reason why-y-y just similar to the previous question but how much is the built structure gonna cost and how much funding do you think require towards completing the very end but it could be in the range 80,000 plus materials we would look at the options where we can fundraise providing me fine but I 'd management model to operate with reserve management with me who currently manages the assets and we would be prepared to discuss structured the project to form and as the reserve management committee supportive yes theirs and they as part of the complex current complex would add value and also allow us to attract more activities to the ear because current main field is very bad it 's impossible to use and thank you very much well we 're gonna move

Association understands this we listened with interest to discussions around local alcohol policy decision recently and we 're naturally disappointed that this has been deferred to the next council to decide we strongly agree with the is not fit for purpose and believe that it 's fact against community participation in particular it 's stacked against low-income communities like those that Mina who represent those same communities have the easiest access to low-cost alcohol and incur the most alcohol-related in my community and Wilson where I live I have within 50 meters two bottles falls in a supermarket not to mention the three pubs and this is not uncommon since 1989 it is immunity 's like mine and those that we sue this table they 'd have borne the brunt cheapening alcohol and the harm that it is caused placing a targeted rate on license would put pressure on the margins alcohol retailers and would likely increase the price of alcohol especially at the low end the World Health Organization global strategy to produce abuse of alcohol notes increasing the price of alcoholic beverages is one of the most effective interventions to reduce harmful use alcohol the approach targets young and heavy drinkers who are more suited to price change the measure that we are suggesting would certainly go towards the aim of the Christchurch alcohol focus on non-regulated drinking environments I guess making alcohol access harder for young people would prevent things like cheap rtd mixes being consumed in parks and schools in this option that we 're proposing they 're targeted right hasn 't been tried as far as we 're we 're in New Zealand but we understand it as possible under the local government rating it council incurs many additional costs from alcohol use in abuse from city to street cleaning alcohol licensing cleaning up parks as well as funding community organisations that dealing with at the bottom of the cliff as such we are urging the council to take this on and to use the funds raised make a difference to the people especially a young people whose lives are impacted by alcohol k ed is working with schools and organisations to develop best practices ID policies but young people struggling with a OD issues they 're having to wait three months for counselling amongst others isn 't needed there is simply not enough support for them a targeted rate of 2% could raise 300,000 to support prevention and treatment we petition signed by 124 people in support of this beautiful thank you Andrew thank you council concern as I understand it certainly from our discussions around the local alcohol policy is around proliferation and density of bottle stores selling particularly cheap liquor and particularly in low socio-economic areas I 'm interested in two things about your proposal first of all how it would specifically target the cheap liquor rather than all liquor and secondly I 'm interested in paragraph 26 in your submission it 's likely the most affected business owners would be independently owned and operated bottle shops rather than supermarkets and the change that they have given that supermarkets would pay far more rates than some of those small stores I 'd be interested in how that would be the case well simply put date imagined in small stores much lower and but they 're also the ones that tend to sell the cheapest alcohol like RT DS and things like that I mean the counselor I 'm sure could come up with the variety of options it would discourage the sale of things like our T DS quo but the thing is it 's it is a relatively blunt instrument but it 's better than the parents options available to you and this is an option that yeah we really think is worth trying so thank you very much for your submission it 's a very important area for us as a council as you know well I just you know I just so admire you for including around the targeted rate that you would also include the supermarkets because that 's where I guess all of us to be honest kiddie air cheaper wine or whatever we buying so I 'm just wondering would you anticipate though that are taking and taking on including the supermarket 's that in fact there might be some reaction to that of course is going to be reaction because it 's you 're going to take on a cost but they always have the option of not selling alcohol in if you had any advice on on legality of charging a rate for only informally we don 't have a legal opinion we 're not really that well resource which at the sorghum website and I just can 't see that it would meet any of the criteria for charging a braid for a specific service it 's the trouble so I know that I know what you 're looking for and I know that everyone around the table does actually understand that it 's the cheap alcohol from off licenses that are causing so much here I can a study and have done for a number of years and I think you 're looking for a solution from the place that can 't offer the real solution that you need which is minimum pricing exactly I mean I agree that minimum pricing per unit I mean the evidence is pretty clear around it but I looking at the legislature in an informal advisor it 's possible it meant that the guidelines on the sort of website but that doesn 't mean that they 're necessarily right no that 's true it 's true the reference a few court cases those big news Erin Ben Glen yeah and your submission you referenced behavior with with alcohol buying cheap alcohol drinking night and the council hasn 't gone down the road of stopping that would you like to see like a nighttime ban or drinking in packs and school grounds odd for us to enforce school grounds were certainly parks in terms of the approach that we take this this kind of approach with increasing the cost of alcohol as much is proven to have an impact whereas liquor bans really just shift the problem and it also it 's quite a punitive approach and we we like to take a restorative a public health approach try and deal with with it from a bigger picture perspective I guess the Health Organization has seen there 's approach that actually makes a big difference clean you your submission is about alcohol we 've been talking about the silikal placement of off licenses if you 've got any information over a combination of the placement of those along with making machines fast-food outlets in lower socio I mean that the research is really clear around just talking about alcohol I know and stats are similar with pokies on fast-food they tend to concentrate and and so if you live in the most deprived suburbs it 's about twice as easy to get off licensed alcohol as it is say if you live in a the least deprived ten percent of suburbs yeah and it 's borne out across the country but particularly in urban areas thank you very much I mean obviously we 'll take advice on the matter but but I want to get your hopes up you might have to direct your attention further than all thank you very much _"

    "text": "Association of Social Workers Association call a karateka to do when you brighten the hope Oh Jimmy Makai taco in okay thank you for having us here and I hope that you have familiarize ourselves with the written submission and so we want to speak to that but also offer you some stories from social with practitioners working here at Rice to make up our case because I was strapped to a position so first just the highlight that that it 's a well-known fact that the current housing stock in Christchurch is an adequate and this has change as a result of the 2011 wait we see a call on the council to prioritize this as part of its clean we recognized that social housing is within the current proposal AB believe it 's an inner quickly prioritized not just in terms of strength because it 's it 's long a lot of other community projects we 'd like to see it as it seemed own priority ideally but in terms of budgets as well who that we were led we are a weird that that there are 200 _''_144.709 council houses there was insurance for this unclear to us we bit with it money went to the rebuild debt stock and we do believe that there is a huge reason were issue of housing poverty in Christchurch and when we talk about housing poverty we 're not just about a lack of X to house we 're talking about unsuitable housing and well people living in old dilapidated housing I 'm sorry to say it includes somehow council housing as well as what we understand from the feedback that we have received so the bigger picture to that is the human rights legislation about everyone 's right to have adequate housing and shelter and so and not only as council members they call on US citizens of christ to really consider what we are saying in the presentation so what it 's looking like in Christchurch there are increased numbers that far known families things choose services due to the compounding effects as property so we 're talking about people with pneumonia health issues social issues all of these things have a ripple effect on how family functions well employment it 's reflected in the ovis bribe special hasn 't stopped we understand this month waiting list for social housing accounts and some area there has to be something that you hear and think to yourself what must that be like for those people we are living and the limbo land that they dwell on whilst they 're waiting for suitable housing that they can afford we 're leaving them in an unregulated private housing market there 's no representation of those people I you and housing New Zealand I wrote really when it comes down to it and as I say these are compounding that have health and social problems of citizens of Christ who and we do not believe that this issue has been taken seriously no substantive change has been addressed to to focus on housing poverty and the price so in speaking to our members and when I say members that resents over 500 social workers just within Canterbury and it also represents Tony Dafina where Social Work practitioners as well so that 's on top of the plus 500 members so we 've kind of stats and data but we 're kind of interested in dealing with current realities so we asked for some narratives from those who are working in the community with those Toyota Innova in with farno so these are just a couple of the many that kind of represent the kind of this as Hera does this is the kind of lived experience of those who are living in housing Park poverty and I was a bit facetious and titling it is this your grandmother because I think it 's a shoe for us all and there was a story of a low-income elderly woman who is disabled with model health problems currently living in an unsuitable damp living environment with no disabled access she can 't get out and about she already has kind of poor health conditions already and these are kind of being further compounded by her living environment and I guess the current solution for here is that there isn 't one and that idea of being on a wait list waiting for something that doesn 't exist and a lot of the feed from members for something that doesn 't exist and that 's both were then reflective of what 's happening within the broader context of having housing New Zealand but also within the social housing context here and Canterbury as this your siblings are no again stories that about low-income far knows who are renting privately you know we 're talking about the working poor and often the stories kind of reflect that the market rents get increased and the ripple effects of what that means is huge for these people people are having to leave the area in order to find cheaper suitable housing so that means uprooting whole family 's been ins uprooting kind of local support networks people might be engaged in their GP that means children having to leave school and having to kind of find new schooling areas and again this is not happening once but for some far no it 's happening again and again when the price goes up another hundred dollars a week the implications of their huge in not just on the individual but on the defano system and again the solution is that 't exist though the question is what will you do and I direct this to you as as counselors what will you do when housing poverty is contributing to the continued poor health and social outcomes of people in auto taaha Christchurch what will you do in increasing increases in housing poverty are kind of related or connect with the increase in demand for health and social services and Christchurch what will you do when housing poverty is just costing Christ huge I don 't know if there 's been any kind of cost-benefit analysis but I would be interested to know what that would be what 's the actual cost of this and what will you do when housing posit poverty can be addressed in a really meaningful ins in substantive way by the simple reprioritizing of social housing and the long-term plan and I 'll leave you with those thoughts thank you thank you questions though thank you very much for your submission based on those those personal stories can I just ask you just in terms of what you 've written to like you you seem to the lack of social housing and all of the implications of that for Christchurch then in fact we as councils need to make a decision about whether or not we actually build a rugby stadium or multi-purpose arena or whether we give some attention to the housing conditions for the people in Christ 's huge Christchurch will be able to participate in the vibrant city so how can you participate if you 've got this going on in your life seriously we 're talking about basic needs here and there is it is really important to be emotive about this because it is social and emotional secondly there there 's a drop in the number of counts house and houses and price you have not been replenished the long-term plan talks about remediating existing housing there 's no discussion of rebuilding housing so it it isn 't good it 's not even getting it to the baseline and we know that there are huge issues as a result of the earthquake for Christ 's us so we should be even looking yonder not asking you to choose us between the about that because got to manage it we 're asking you to live up to the promise vision and actually really consider what has happened the facts of what have happened to there at the housing stock and now you want the city to be experienced by all the citizens not just rugby fans thank you very much that 's um a good note to end on thank thank you for your submission this afternoon thank you I 'm sorry two councillors that want to ask questions but I have to stick to the time frame that was been allocated the only fear to others who come to make submissions _"

    "text": "it 's all from forest and bird well we 'll swap the order come forward thank you I 'm just gonna start with good afternoon welcome no thank you I 'm Francis all speaking for the North Canterbury branch of the forest and bird and I gave useful and Ainsley Talbot in this report we put a really extensive which I 'm fairly wide red there are three two main areas that I wish to emphasize we about 3,000 members and Tavares oh we have a fairly small in North Canterbury we have about 3,000 fifth who are behind us in these issues so the two key areas that I want to improvise are the obvious ones of climate change and the enhancement and protection of biodiversity so these areas are lessened deficit and your long term plan in fact climate change leadership is one of the six strategic priorities but much of your plan seems to be business as usual and we think top priority should be given to addressing climate change signaling change to our community end funding action it needs to be explicit in the 30 year a strategy about which areas to defend from the effects of climate change and where to retreat from therefore no specific projects to address climate change are included in the infrastructure strategy really no infrastructure strategy at all yet for climate change that seemed amazing and at least surely some funding should be certified in the budget for some research projects start to address this the effects of climate change will bore on us whether or not we 've worked out where to retreat from so it seems incredible to us that there is no infrastructure strategy at all as yet so very important to start reducing this and regard it as a key priority inextricably linked with this of course is the topic of biodiversity we it 's not listed as a strategic priority but just by the way I have to say one good thing is that I 've seen the 2018 Natural Environment survey comes under the umbrella of city life natural environment and that 's really good in terms of drawing respondents attention to issues of biodiverse and individual responsibility which is what we need to disseminated and it 's not so good if it 's only through environmental organizations networks which is how I came by it however it 's a step in the right direction also on the same theme progressing the surveys of sites of ecological significance as listed in the christchurch district plan is urgent and I wonder if money is allocated to us so getting down to the specifics when it comes to biodiversity we have some specific local examples of where greater support there is already some councils support and we appreciate that but we think these projects need to be supported more overtly and will impetus so for example forest and bird owns a small reserve that 's called called green reserve the his cut estuary mouth on the opposite theory Mead making efforts to create a or to revert this to a natural salt marsh area there 's an adjacent hinterland pyramid Regional Park it 's part of which it 's used for horse raising I believe that there 's this council lend we believe it should be allowed to revert or encourage to revert to a salt the inland a second project is Mahoney Nui in the port hills of Evans Pass Road it 's just a small area which is being regenerated and native plantings and forest and bird has been working on that for some years and there are similar issue initiatives not necessarily all forests and birds such as Grace Reserve and mcCormick they it 's it 's an uphill battle to regenerate native bush in those areas as you can imagine and we think it needs a lot of support there 's a huge amount of volunteer hours that go into all of the above it 's a vastly valuable resource that supports council work it puts its in terms of value for money there is no money being expended by the council so the volunteer hours are intensely valuable we would also push for the use of suitably trained staff on restoration sites we are Christchurch City Council maintenance crews operate we 've given heard some heartbreaking stories of plants being mowed or sprayed not deliberately just through sheer unawareness which Rick 's hours of Valen Valen tear work and so it 've nurtured for months months suddenly it 's a mode willy-nilly and albeit a well-intentioned operation to clear path and so we think some trained staff we account City Council workers are doing the clearance on restoration sites wood huge advantage well I do think that total support has always been given to some of these initiatives and just on a little tiny note on that there was a volunteer working by the called Green Reserve when we did the mother of all rubbish cleanups last week and he had was obliged to wheelbarrow tons of stuff a long disconnection point occurred to me that surely a little bit more money could have been put into council waste disposal people for collecting that a little bit more easily it was just that it seemed we were being done a favor rather than the other way around just by the way support for projects by parks rangers knowledged and and it has been great from people like dikötter and on a larger scale please he 'd regenerate Christchurch 's proposal for the 11 kilometer green spine on either side of the we think this is a superb opportunity and we heartily endorse that at the moment excellent question yes questions our Phil thank you for your submission I guess around the area of its infrastructure strategy and climate change you might be a wee because you refer to it in your submission around a full engagement what the people especially the people in the and the coast and the coastal areas but you also refer to engaging with the whole city around climate change you want to perhaps it could expect elaborate on there why all of Christchurch to be engaged well the whole is going to be affected so we just better brace here so for that reality and and you would have heard me on Monday when I presume the moming the fact that the people of questions generally our epiphytic I think very very largely in somehow whether we have overcome that apathy and as I said on Monday it really does require strong leadership from the council you wouldn 't lead the way how can you expect us to follow thank you um Yanni thank you um raise the issue of having a Heathcott River catchment plan and I don 't know just in light of your comment around acquiring the horse grazing for wetlands restoration and I just wondered if you 've given much thought to having a more holistic sort of catchment playing along the heath get for the area that you look after and whether that would be of value and secondly to that I know that there was a plan changed to though an industrial land which was quite had a lot of biodiversity on the other side of where your reservas have you also given any consideration to make out for pirates that some of the projects [Music] we haven 't specifically but I 'm sure one of our members fellow occasion very associated if here and River and I suspect of this in we also have the forest and bird who looks after our called the green reserve is very very passionate about the idea of extending the wetland area I don 't know about a holistic plan I 'd love to see one we don 't we it 's obviously think that 's a necessary step thank you very much for your presentation this afternoon very much appreciated thank you thank you thanks for your time thank _"

reached the declaration level well you can you 've given you 've given one of the acting chief executives I suspect that the reason is is that you want to reduce the number of counselors in you 're making the point we 've read your submissions what are they wait you just made it very hard to present I 'm staying goody bags breaking the Borum I think we 've done that that staying focused on the basics is boring boring is really hard losing focus is easy as I just demonstrated in your goodie bag you 'll find toothpicks these are there to help you hold your with the rubber band when you 're in the beatings and you get bored you see someone else has gone to sleep bring one Adam if you 're not supposed to ping them at each other you ping them on your wrist yep no I do apologize with madam mayor you are supposed to ping them at each other as well if you only if they 're asleep that 's right the glasses the glasses are simply to help you focus you 'll also find there 's a piece of transparency film in your bag that 's because want transparency around issues so you can public support my story the sucker trucks yes we all have a sob story I have one it rains welcome to climate change city care shut down our part of the vacuum sewer system to protect five other nodes the pump trucks showed up every two hours all through the night breaking our sleep at night they seen the subtract a subcontractor with the loudest tract I called the council I called the team I talked to the manager I was assured it would be came back I called the manager the fixes had not been done why city managers were just arguing about whose budget it 's on skirts versus councils central government versus local governments my attitude yes I come without a chute some of your you know that the role of the overseers you guys the managers were struggling I don 't blame the managers actually I don 't blame anyone the role of overseers as I see it as belt bridge gaps breakdown deadlocks rise up lines of communications and green support networks were you asleep were you not watching so as storm water drinking water are just boring I get it there 's a party going on there are new pools there are new buildings there are new events everyone wants something now actually I know you guys are awake talking with people like councillor deal 54 hours a week in meetings plus social media at the weekends who would want your job you guys work harder than many and that 's well accepted but you asked what I want Dom Gould private citizen and a resident you asked does what I want for the next 10 years which is why I 'm here submitting what I want is core businesses boring I would like more focus or business more attention to our failing sewers attention to our stormwater attention to our drinking water attention to keeping our roads and city clean I want more in public less px ' public exclusion more transparency around the costs of everything it 's easy to stand up and say why didn 't account to spend money on doing that and why do they spend so much money doing that and then just not pick up our rubbish because we don 't realize that a contractor actually costs X dollars to go round and pick up the rubbish but because it 's done by sitting here that means that you can 't actually tell us what the negotiated contractors with the private company even though the private company is owned by guess who the council it 's boring but now you have the tools and your goodie bags to deal with it thank you any questions thank you look at I think they as the popular we 're but but that 's because you tagged me with my private name not my mayoral name I do both well yeah but anyway but the private one is the one that gets through to me so but in I haven 't_''_383.27 I haven 't defended you like I have no no no no no no no the point is is that the point is is that I actually have defended people for because they 're not really my friends my friend either but but I 've deep friended people but you for using my private Facebook page because it 's not for my mural thing but I haven 't do and the reason is that you have taken the time and the effort to understand issues and then to debate them in an intelligent way and I actually think that being that we need more people like you who are willing to tackle hard issues and actually remind us that it is about the basics in focusing on what really matters to keeping a city afloat so I just wanted to take the opportunity to public awareness about the things that are important the chlorine and the water the the cirrage I mean the the sucker trucks the all of these things they 're core critical to our city and so I just wanted to kind of acknowledge you and I 've got over your five minutes so down you know I 'll let you revise that you were named Asteria Thanks thanks for the information as well but I exceed was thinking I know you want to get rid of community boards but I think you should run for it I don 't actually want to get rid of community boards I think there are fabulous and in response to Lee Anne if I may Dionne part of the reason why I do engage with yourself and with Vicki a little bit more and with Sarah a little bit more as well and not actually with the mayor is because I also see that it 's important that as a resident I bring issues to to a sort of a layer up and then if you guys actually see some value in what I layer again in fact I 've actually been engaging more with Allie Jones who is our local community board I do apologize that I didn 't turn up to yesterday 's meeting and I accept that some of the residents are getting harder to because of the frustrations out there as well which is why I 've been making more of an effort to end get traction engage with the issues and then try and help support that problem I admit that some of the problems my personal sewer problem has tuned up because I was asleep at the wheel I wasn 't paying any attention I was just looking after my business in my space well thank you very much for coming yeah I 'd like to catch up with you before you disappear if we could adjourn now for lunch break and a briefing its surrounding budget opening this afternoon and so we are joining this meeting until 10 if people could be back here _"

the rivers and the coastline there are our pathways and that to some magnificent parts of South Island that is what motivates us to live and stay in Christchurch so I 'd like to kick off our submission I want to talk a little bit about goats on exponential oh yeah we can get rid of them at the moment council he can and doc have a joint project we all put money in and we undertake what 's called sustained control of those goat populations now by putting a little bit more money in in five years time we believe we can actually eradicate the goats off the peninsula and that gives us some defendable space he can have done a superb job and their pest management strategy recently of recognizing that and giving us powers under the biosecurity Act you 'll can your Christchurch you 'll Rangers on the port hills do a fantastic job working with us on the ground we 're upping our commitment to getting rid of goats he can are upping their commitment to getting rid of goats and we would like the council to up your commitment to getting rid of the guys every so it 's a so it 's a pretty good investment this is a really good start to a pest free peninsula the other part of my submission is is to encourage the council to support a common plan for a partnership approach with with pest free banks peninsula particularly to support I 'm here to support the submission made by the Banks Peninsula Conservation Trust who have asked for 50,000 to help create a strategy for a pest free peninsula again it 's all generating support from ICANN and support from the Department of Conservation that will give us a long-term plan out to 2050 of how we actually will achieve this trench level the other thing I would like to bring to the council 's attention is that is for the council to continue to provide financial grants and community groups such as the rod Donald trust quail Island ecological restoration trust in the Summit Road Society were actively supporting conservation outcomes those groups again to a great job of lobbying every agency whether it 's the Department of Conservation City Council weekend for further funding so any return for conservation because they get something from you and then they come straight to us my third key submission point is around water I guess you 're hearing a bit about this doc encourages the Christchurch City Council to recognize national importance of biodiversity and the city 's rivers histories and wetlands particularly shorebirds wetland birds and freshwater fish the council have done a fantastic job with its bylaws and cities rivers to protect tuna eels and we would love to see that extended to a fantastic reserve to cover eels and even heathcote rivers the rivers took a real knock during the earthquake and it 's important for us to recreate some of the ena a wetland areas that have previously been degraded that was some great work was being done on the foot prior to make our meaning are in trouble we know our Minister is going to be working on it quite soon I see your help will be supported ongoing support and enhancement for the lamprey habitats and the canal drain and reserve national road again this is another area where I want to congratulate further support for the enviros Schools program this is something that we 're a partner and already for many other councils and Croesus city council do provide some funding through strengthen strengthening the communities fund one of your fans however we know there are 47 schools on the waitlist for enviro schools programs in Christchurch so there 's a lot of schools here a lot of schools want to engage in our outdoors in our environment no no doubt the demand for this and this is one way that the Department has chosen to do there we would encourage the council to hone their tuition in one of the final points I would make us is around the sites of ecological significance program the need to push that hard and fast as overwhelming and we 've seen recently the degradation that 's occurred at Cato ET and the boss of habitat from Yul and Becky Estonia and and so many other threatened species due to a land-use change which actually frankly shouldn 't have ever been a lamp and the demand and if those plan provisions can 't protect that to protect you in your life um so we do want to acknowledge and congratulate the council I think your Ranger teams heroes they compliment my team very well we 've fought fires together we maintain tracks together we do biodiversity work together we do whale strandings seel seel strandings together they 're absolutely awesome any reinforcement of time and energy and hours it for those those staff who stretched a million different ways is greatly appreciated so thank you for your continuing support for those range of teams they 're great thank you very much and you have absolute support for the for the Rangers and I know that they feel just as much just as strongly about working with the with the dock staff such as yourself so thank you I 've got Vicky I 've got Tim and then I 've got Phil in Andrew and Dion but we may not get through everyone so I 'll be brief and thank you very much for a lot of presentation and just in terms of working with young people and in conservation and in the gardens and at end cultivate the other day you do urban agriculture horticulture horticulture are we so keen to be involved with the Department of Conservation be interested in there in agriculture no interns interns working with you because we 're finding a tremendous shortage of workers in frequent and all that sort of theory I would love to be able to say yes probably caught by similar constraints as you are I would love to say yes we don 't have one person dedicated to education and that 's why we work in Christchurch and that 's why we work with enviros schools essentially we contract our commitment out to the Cape so we should talk to you hamton thank you if you can just go back to the slide that had the banks peninsula in the areas of the goats yes so magnets so shot a few things in my talk about you know what the areas so for instance you why don 't you kind of isolate an area and try and wipe them out and then next area next here I know they can that 's what around but exactly our approach this year we 're aiming for eradication here it 's a first year with aim for eradication and one particular zone yep if we get eradication there and it protects the rest of that yeah most about half the peninsula so you did right and that protects also the wild side area it 's another area where he can City Council and dock and the community work together on so it keeps goats away from the Hawaii area from now reserves over in that area and from the great marine protected area I see so you 're gonna start that program so you 're starting with that one and then you 're working way around and that 's right we had a really good trial last year yeah prices Valley and Kai tuna belly and we almost got them all that we 've beefed up the rates significantly this with the help of the rod Donald trust completed phase won 't already we have permission from the landowners affect landowners and they 're approaching us because they they can see the competency that has been injected into those you know you know I mean we come back to this area and we isolate the populations at that point and then we stack thank you thank you very much um for the sake of other submission that are coming forward the times come to a conclusion but thank you very much for your submit and I think that 's been very powerful one day I think _"

    "text": "right each we have business associations the indocin good morning good morning welcome thank you for letting me speak my name 's Stephen Anderson I 'm the owner of each we 're fresh choice supermarket and I represent the pH where Business Association firstly I 'd just like to say that the Association fully supports the community community boards request for funding of the each we 're Paul the purpose of the edge where Paul project is intended to reinstate and operate the much-loved and highly patronized community swimming hall in each we 're Village formally known as the edge we 're Paul you would have heard from previously pulled some of all the chairman of the edge where Paul grew a previous mission and also from Brian Gardiner the current current president of the sandal band swimming club who presented on the history of the pool so I won 't go too deeply into that but to date the the pool group set up an incorporated society with a charitable status in 2006 so far the poor group has raised a hundred and fifty thousands towards a new Paul reports required for a resource consent and the consent fees and the resource consent was granted in 2017 there 's been many achievements during this these years so currently to date the tour group has got a detailed design and completed a feasibility report the resource consent has been granted and the land ownership was obtained and we also have a full costing of the pork of the project to rebuild the pool from Apollo projects and that comes in at five million dollars briefly this the the pool itself the facility would consist of one heated indoor pool which is 14 meters by 12 meters and it 's fully accessible will be one heated outdoor pool of 25 meters by 12 feet meters and again fully accessible and there has been plans for landscaping fencing lighting car parks in cycle packs the associated building will contain a fire entry office kitchen meeting room toilet and showers and both of these are we fully accessible now the operation the edgeware pool group will run the pool independently of council and therefore they do not expect council to provide further operational the city community projects bribe by providing five million for the capital works for the new pool noting that this project is ready to commence once the funds are available the edge of your pool is not an aquatic facility like the council pools that is a community facility a gathering place a safe place for people of all ages to meet a place for children and adults to learn to swim and a warm pool for the community to use as exercise and relaxation year-round in the summer there is an outdoor space which would be landscaped and as a vision to provide an ideal place for picnics sharing food and sunbathing etc this will be a community facility of a size and scale that will be affordable to operate and be appropriate for the needs of the sand albans community it is intended to not to compete with the larger council aquatic facilities the communities Paul serves a different purpose this will be one that we owned and operated and used by the local community its purpose is to activate and strengthen the local community as did the that you times you know running by we 've read the submission you don 't need to read it to us just look just highlight the key points and then that will allow some time for questions okay all right so you from the previous speakers so I just like to say in summary that we can mean the pool group for bringing together the whole community the project is a partnership which will benefit benefit the business operators the schools in the widest and Ovens community the LTP funding needs to be spread across all the suburbs the pool groups detail costing shows of the Edgewood community all can be built for five million dollars this is opposed to the for example of the Linwood Paul which is being proposed at over 21 million by utilizing a similar design it would be possible to build two ports for less than half of the Linwood proposal with a potential saving for the council of over 10 million dollars just like to reiterate that we wish to see the edge were all rebuilt the the pool group has made huge progress group through their own energy and hard work have demonstrated exactly what the council wants to see which is strong motivated connected activated communities initiating and delivering their own projects thus becoming more resilient the business the edgeware Business Association are seeking the council support to achieve this very worthwhile project thank you questions yonni thanks for the submission um two questions one is my understanding was that there was some land around the former into a pool side or maybe part of it that was going to be sold off and and put back into the community center do you know is that happened this is the Business Association supporting the RO yeah it 's probably a better question directed to someone else I think we can find out the answer to their the other thing I mean you 've mentioned the Linwood Pole so I guess I 've got to ask the question you know we 've got lots of different community facilities and each where for example there 's a new community center going in which is quite considerably more expensive than other similar type community centers Martin 's Opower do you think we need to kind of you know reduce that budget to fund those other ones to the same degree or as you know is there a smarter way in which you see us being doing that projects that you think we would get better value yes differently I certainly don 't want to disadvantage any other communities or suburbs but you know wewe would be quite happy to release our design you know to the to the council because I believe we achieve these projects you know in a lot effective and cheaper manner Vince of working with local communities about what they want which your group has done I think we can achieve both but for a considerably less cost thank you excellent well thank you very much for for coming and making a submission thank you thank you thank you _"

    "text": "Commodore Airport Hotel Michael Patterson welcome back I think being million and counselors thank you for allowing me to come back again with me today I have felicity Blackmore from Russia 's international airport Felicity is the development and compliance manager for crush International Airport so um what our submission is around around making things safer for cycling from the airport into the into the into the city now we actually are all very appreciative of that the council has has taken and making Christchurch the top cycling town for 2017 it 's really pleasing to see it the accolade that 's here so our issue is that we believe there 's a gap between the the airport and around Pendleton Road so around whether the BP is there there 's cycling along that part of Memorial Avenue is quite dangerous the the submission has has been supported by well I 've spoken to the to the schools and in businesses along the way as well and the the next slide at self-etch you really shot shows of the area the the area we 're really talking about is the if you 're not an Road now what what 's going on here is is quite honestly you 've got a a Scotsman 's carpark from the airport for overflow over the airport and you know as people have said said to me we 've got we 've got people parking along Leah on and using you know the public facility to park and avoid paying fees have you put there that 's that 's part of our problem so what 's happening we 're seeing people pushed onto the footpath so so what I 've done around this is I engaged the guys from oblique insulting to to help me I tick you late what we 're trying to achieve here so this was only for one hour that this was Steven from Abe he was with me for an hour and a half and there was these examples were not staged this is this is the reality of people cycling to the airport so what what 's happened here is along outside the Commodore you 're seeing a cyclist choose to jump onto the footpath instead of the this wonderful overpass that that that is the entrance to our city and then there 's a cyclic lane there then all of a sudden it just stops and you can see here with us the van is driving along the left-hand Lane there and if there was a cyclist riding that be squeezed between the van and the the car ok so it 's not just and these people are not just actually they 're not just those you know choosing to fly away and leave the car there for a couple of weeks but there there 's also a wave of people that are working in the technology park as well now what drew push this really home for us as a family is one of my boys was knocked off his bicycle by a just along here and by it was the person who knocked them off well opening the car door was actually working in the technology park so choosing to park on Memorial Avenue aimed to to walk through the alleyway the end of the technology park so there 's another photo here you can being taken up this pedestrian refuges that have been put along the the roadway there as well they 're actually a bit of a nuisance to to cyclist forcing them to to jump in the lane but here 's an example where you know this piece of roadway here could form part of the solution that 's actually along Burnside Park Lea and there is an entrance as there so maybe that 's an opportunity along layer for a sheared footpath this is the crash record so there 's there 's actually statistics around it but like the accident of my own son was involved and that wasn 't reported so there 's you know you might imagine that it 's quite a lot higher than that okay and it 's um so what we 're asking for is a the as a safer route for both cyclists now and in the previous opportunity to submit for the study plan we did along with the airport company and what we did there is we talked about maybe making some of the cycle ways more obvious there is actually a bunch Avenue and we ask for signage to be improved for those and that the truth is that they 're actually too and indirect they just they just don 't they don 't they don 't work in terms of they 're too convoluted for for people that are that are new to the area so it 's just not efficient yeah the so we believe there 's an opportunity for visitors for employees people working at the airport company at the airport and also the schools particularly the high schools like my Burnside high school there is acknowledgement that that for primary schools like burn so primary Christ the King the kids should be walking or you know that they but the high schools definitely could be made made better and some of the solutions what I suppose what we 're asking is that the conversation started in that there 's there 's actually a consultant consultation happens because you know I 'm a layperson I I don 't know how it could be made better but there 's there 's definitely where there 's been parking restrictions put in parking along Leah but it seemingly actually reduces that those people that just simply dump their car there for days whilst you know a lazy sort of solution and so so parking restrictions could be part of the part of solution definitely to to just simply paint the road remove some parking down by the airport those down the errand and continue that cycle lane would be a great solution and the sheared foot sheared footpath probably just like from the airport 's perspective the resource of the facility for parking is provided as part of our wider campus also recognizing that the airport campus itself has tourists that may want to bike to and from the airport it also supports a large amount of people that work and service the airport industry and giving them a safe and efficient and effective way of riding their bike to the to work as opposed to driving a car will reduce traffic congestion as a as a one for any of everyone essentially but at the moment they 're most direct and efficient route to get to the airport is only really willing to take your life in your hands most days as a person who does this every day and is the only way to get there is by driving your car essentially and there 's a few really easy ways that we could encourage a cycle lane all the way and make it so both rogue users and cyclists and pedestrians could use this main corridor to get to and from the airport and and a lot of our new developments out of the airport which are increasing the amount of people that work there we provide bicycle parking facilities provide them in covered it 's one of the requirements in the outline pane in the resource consent process that we have to go through so I guess it 's just coordinating and those two pieces of infrastructure so the staff members get to the airport and they can park your bike safely but they can also bite to the airport without risking their lives I live and particularly shared historical footpaths it 's easily achieved in the bins I also know that you know the airport 's reconfiguring their psychical stuff there my main concern and I 'm interested in how you approach it and it was raised at a seminar earlier this morning as cyclists getting across Rusli Road how do you how do you envisage a safe access or ability for cyclists to get across rusty right it 's got those major turn left and that major entry and from the motorway but it 's been dealt with yeah but you 've got and you 've got a left turn yeah a major left tune and a major lift into the back into more relieve on the other side of the bridge so yes the over bridge takes the through traffic yeah but that 's the merging traffic and to a cycle with no with very limited visibility I mean oh I can just see that there 's another problem there that might have to be solved with another set of lights which is just throws me to the back of my teeth but I mean I 'm hearing what the issues are yeah but I think that and what you 're suggesting is is that what 're and we made a lot better than it was with the roundabout poking us a lot it 's a lot better well you said is much bigger than the roundabout I agree much better yeah but there are still cycle safety issues once you enter and they enter the bridge environment underneath we 'd love an underpass again yes I know but the underpass was put up the other end so I would it wasn 't our dog but that 's that 's anyway so yeah it needs some thought given to it but thank you very much for your submission it 's obviously a lot of interest around the table thank you so thank you _"

    "text": "greening the Bridgestone Celia Hogan we 're not seeing your Hogan oh wait okay who are we thank you today sorry want to talk about the green spine which has come out since since another day so we are a community group which supported the concept of a green spine we 've got about 50 but we yeah we strongly believe that ecological restoration needs to be at the forefront of what Christ Church does with this piece of linen so we believe that the Avon or Target or Forest Park is underrepresented in the current plan but that it represents a significant opportunity to see their tune of quite strong ecological values to the city we believe that this would bring widespread benefits including human physical and mental health benefits and research which is constantly being done sorry we realize that the majority of the red zone is owned by the crown but we are disappointed we 're disappointed to see no financial commitment from the council to this to this red zones land we would appreciate the recent announcement re a five year transitional licenses but we would there was a mother of all cleanup and a health and safety breach that brief there was 20 pages long we know that there are people who have found a huge amount of people that are required to start something like that up quite daunting including our own chair CEO Hogan who was also hoping to activate some kind of codes natural pre-play areas so we would like to ask that yeah there is a simplification of of process for projects that want to get underway and I guess that translates to anything that goes on in the city we also don 't want to be another group coming to council you know asking for a handout however we believe that the redzone regeneration is an almost part of Christchurch 's future and a major asset to the city in many ways it can be something that helps to mitigate the climate change effects it can bring wildlife back to the city and it can help remove heavy metals insult that that sits in the wetland area and it can also be a strong you know forced to rejuvenate the huge carbon sink and we know that of course there are the health benefits will be a big attraction for locals and travelers so from that perspective we do think that the council should be in putting something into the area so for the next 20 or 30 years the government has suggested that that 's this will be the time to put lots into this residential red zone in terms of the council it does fit into your parks and heritage so we propose that the council spend more money from parks and heritage and put some of it into the redzone land at the moment there is a maintenance budget for it and we also believe that the council is there 's the kind of entity that pays the people who the contractors who do the current maintenance and spraying so one of our kind of gripes at this point of time is now that the that the greens been announced we would like to see some kind of focus the council supporting that in terms of at the moment we 've got people contractors who are spraying terms of the weed weed removal we have their weeds we have certain weeds in the air like gray willow and cotton Easter and second wars that are you know sort of having the away and and and sprouting up so we 'd like to see a bit more of a targeted approach in the short term at the very least but also in the long term to help it become a native habitat there are many other factors other things that this would feed into the government 's proposed to zero carbon act so having not sure the amount of heat is that the reeds owners but 600 600 hectares of mostly regenerating diverse native forests and wetlands this is going to help offset carbon the what concerti Council has actually made a point to plant 1 million trees to go towards the 23d climate change target we also would like to reference back to the biodiversity strategy in 2008 I remember reading about that a long time ago and I 'm not quite sure whether there 's money set aside for how in fact that manifests that 's propose that that returning the the what was the residential red zone to a native forest and is going to be extremely good for the biodiversity of the city Christchurch isn 't known for its biodiversity we still quite an English city in terms of error and fauna wouldn 't it be good to have a sort of long-term vision where we can look back you know put yourself 20 or 30 years in the future and we can look back and say actually we did prioritize biodiversity and and look at the city now that 's what we really want you guys well that 's what we want the long-term plan to be about it 's prioritizing biodiversity the second point that I want to make is about the infrastructure of waste in water so this is another huge area that we think that we feel slightly letdown about in terms of the long term plan we do not think that allowing it to deteriorate a further 10 percent over the next 10 years is a good decision we do understand that people want the surfaces of the roads underneath is probably more important in terms of the health of the surface water and the groundwater in the storm water so we think that that needs a major a major a shift and and we think it would be quite disappointing if it wasn 't put forward as one of the council 's main priorities in terms of the long term plan so we do propose removing some of the spend on the roads and shifting it to robust waste and water infrastructure appear water is obviously quite topical in Christchurch at the moment with the recent chlorination I don 't think anybody would mind right now if you see that you were going to spend more money on keeping the water clean top the top surface water clean I do think though that what the council does need to be communicated very well to people they 're going to take the money out of top top roading then you do need to communicate that very clearly obviously they were top rating is what people see so that 's what people are going to you know annoyed about so about it I hope no meeting that across the other thing is I don 't know if you 've all heard about the white Arkadiy eco sanctuary proposed by Colin Merck he has proposed basically an extension of Travis Wheatland and to have it as a predator proof his own we support this idea quite strongly Christchurch doesn 't patch one of the only main places that one of the only places that doesn 't have a large area like this and not count Borden trekking on bushes to people you know this is something that people really really need so so the walk yeah so Wheatlands are huge in Christchurch as no and I think that we need for our ties those kind of things so Tonya would like to speak about lighting but also feed them to one of ours we have and originally that was just to be an exemplar to show what good lighting can doing us is of course the the delays and bridge that means that we can 't_''_594.87 be an exemplar but when we realize that the LED rollout was happening over the to do is just say that the 4000 K LEDs currently proposed for the refit are not suitable environmentally or health-wise either and the ecological slant of that saying that they 're cheaper and use less energy and therefore our green is kind of incorrect when that when the blue th light they give out has all these negative health impacts and negative environmental impacts we 're really glad to see that the incident EA has extended the period we both connect to get information about that and there is the amazing Dunedin tax guys group and they are putting together a big proposal to send around all the council said that will have all the information we what the use of 2,700 2,700 K fully shielded amber color LEDs the city and they are available and we also support for the reason that 's go park when they do become available elected this year the 2200 k fully showed us how in 10 seconds any questions I 'm not going to take 10 second question thank you and I 've made a note of your submission because you 're you 're the first to actually present peace and honor so we 'll obviously have to do some work on that is all coming great well look thank you very much for your submission that 's much appreciated _"

    "text": "right the next one is the Christchurch Stadium trust Tim Shanahan good morning good morning thank you to all of you mayor and councillors for the opportunity to speak to you today on behalf of the cross shooter Stadium trust while both Laura and I 've met with most of you or all of you and various settings just for the sake of introductions I 'm some Shanahan CEO of the stadium trust and beside me is Lauren 's simple one of our trustees or so appropriate to identified David East as one of their trust well so you have a submission in front of you the central mandate for the Christchurch Stadium Trust is to manage and keep open the temporary stadium and so we appreciate the provision that has been made in the draft long term plan for some financial contribution from the council towards particularly operational maintenance and capital renewals in replacement at the stadium and we 've worked with council staff to identify an appropriate sum of money and that is Victor and the long term plan I would say that it doesn 't it doesn terms of sponsorship that has come to an end those contracts I think as we spoke to you about previously we 're contracts that we 're designed to go for the life of the stadium as we first thought it would be and those have now come to a natural conclusion however we do think that with that sort of contribution from the council we are able to keep the stadium operating at least in terms of the sort of timeframes that that we understand our in place in terms of when a new facility might be available and we do make the point in our submission that as time goes on there will be additional and increased requirements in terms of maintenance in case little expenditure and that will obviously need to be factored in but certainly in the timeframe that we 're thinking about at the moment the provision that 's made and the long-term plan as as very reasonable end or certainly assist us considerably to ensure that Christchurch continues to have an operational stadium we do make some comments about other measures in terms of wind 'm happy to answer questions on those as as would be Tim or indeed to answer any other questions that you might have but I certainly want to make the point that our our central mandate as ensuring the temporary stadium remains operational and short team thank you very much does anyone have any questions Jonnie and then Glyn thank you I just wondered if you 'd looked at any different models or operating structures I mean prior to the earthquake office Lee we had V basis council organization running the stadium and given how much money we 're putting into the stadium trust or you know the different financial arrangements that you 've got with V base have you looked at a any other model that might actually get better opportunity to reduce the ongoing costs in terms of not having a stadium trust but actually having an existing entity take over I guess the the reality for us is our trust deed identifies that we are responsible to central government government contributed the bulk of the funds for that venue and and therefore our obligation is to deliver looking at alternate models I think it would be fair to suggest we haven 't done so however I also think it would be fair to say if you look at our operating costs a significant amount of those costs are actually paid to be based to provide the operational capacity for when the stadium is open and the costs relate to the existence of a stadium trusts are feeling minimal our overall budget good Oh Glenn thank you I 'm trying to see how and thank you for your submission and given that you 've entered into that conversation in Andover I knew a reader I 'm just trying to see from a return on investment perspective our new arena would actually work because I can 't see how it could have you got any comments over there how you would measure them of how you know return on an investment is usually measured I think when you 're looking at return on investment for a stadium first and foremost you need to set your parameters in terms of what is an acceptable outcome and if you look at 't always a break-even or return on investment percentage there is a component of having a stadium provides community opportunities and makes a city interesting and able to deliver something that will be of benefit and appreciated by the citizens so it 's a matter of understanding that first and foremost secondly in terms of return on investment this is where it becomes very critical when you are deciding what you are going to build what it is you want to achieve with the venue because stadium trust author Dupree feasibility study last year we identified a number of possible options for each of those options we gave in indications as to what we felt would be the the number of events that venue could host and what the likely return would be in terms of revenue generated by hosting various events so I think it 's very important that in making a decision you have to understand if you go with a cheaper option it is likely going to also mean you are no longer in a position to host certain events and therefore the turn will likely diminish usual measures by which the public has a view over ROI it 's still not going to stick up still not going to stack up but if you put it in the context of I 'm happy for it to be told my figures are uncreate but I 'm gonna put them out there because I believe they are correct dunedin city council currently put somewhere around 8 million dollars a year into Forsyth Barr Wellington City Council won 't and Regional Council put in an amount per year plus additional for capital replacement I believe two years ago it was a man of five or six million for work done on the concourse azat Westpac Stadium so you 've got a situation where councils are making an informed decision that they will put investment into these venues and not necessarily on the basis of return on investment and it also comes down to how you want to measure that return on investment Dunedin sound very happy with the returns on investment that I 've had from events like Ed Sheeran Phil can I just ask you about some of 's 250,000 on the operations in 450,000 on the capital part so and you were really indicating I think in your submission that there was a way of that working given that the stadium will be will be the new multi-purpose arena would go ahead if the multi-purpose arena was delayed have you got can you give us any idea of projected costs say in the longer term well for the the current AMI Stadium we set here I think it might have been May last year and we presented some financial projections with regard to going to 2020 to 2025 and beyond top of my head I think we said that if we went to 2022 and we had all of the existing financial obligations which include the demolition and paying off the council loan we 're projecting we might come up about eight million dollars short and you 're gonna take us to 2025 we might come up twelve million dollars short so we have done that information we 've presented it previously to council I don 't believe those numbers have changed sniffing Li since that presentation term plan process is that twenty twenty-five is no longer the target then it would be prudent for us to do new figures for whatever new data is identified so that we are providing counsel with clarity as to what those costs may be thanks time all right well thank you very much and it 's much appreciated what you do I know that we have very powerful submission the other day from the Crusaders and you know that you know that they said how emotional it was to go out on that on that perch on the day it opened and it has been an important venue for the for the city so thank you very much for what you do in terms of running it and keeping it going on a temporary basis thank you _"

    "text": "yep so can you just make sure that those are added to the hub Thank You house it 's true yes I know that we 've also got a presentation for Pierre and for society and we 'll just group us into one thing if that 's okay yes they 're absolutely fine I 'm thank you for your time counselor Zamir we 've got a few points they talked to and we 've got a bit of a screen at some stage first of all thank you for your support of the Juke festival and surfing you Brighton really goes well on that one we 've had a couple of tests for years maybe we were having had great surf but it 's as you know it 's a really good thing and thank you very much for your support and we look forward to your continuing support also thank you for your support of DCL a new playground at the pier is an absolutely resounding success but done it well and we look forward to our hot pools now though thank you for your continued support our second freedom camping and I guess you probably have heard a bit about this already from everyone you know our for sure is polluted so maybe can we consider suggest a few things in the short term and we 've when we say short term we mean six to eight weeks maybe we can just change some signage and just advise people of the alternatives to going there we 've got a South Brighton 's and motor camp facilities there it 's not overpriced for those people that do camp there we 've got toilets in the facility but a lot of those toilets are only closed and the can we either have them 7 or put some portaloos on there and then the last thing is rubbish and that 's the perennial problem I guess we just need some more rubbish mensier or or a better or a more efficient collection method you might say that the more bins are there will be more rubbish but we don 't believe that rubbish is going to go somewhere at some time in any way in the long term we would like they haven 't blenheim with which is a private enterprise it 's a pay s and you probably have seen not seen this we 've actually talked to the sky yeah okay great thank you but last of all maybe we 're near the coastal campaign and be someone that can welcome the people to the area enough on that on the on the doors or camper windows or whatever forming them of both facilities around it might just be a handout and force moving on if necessary so give them some powers and and that will give you the council valuable feedback if Guzman Nelson do need and the McKenzie can 't_''_175.26 you can 't councils can do this I think we can too the third point is our community board they have requested some funding to tidy up the south side of the pier pier and for sure will wholeheartedly support this one the grass tyrion needs to rethink a the the ugly disrespectful barrier around the Cenotaph needs to go we need an appropriate fence last those photos the next point if still okay I 'll do got the equivalent I 'm just one you know those owners have low that 's the years of New Brighton mall and and the council really be able to facilitate some sort of action on those guys even if it 's not funny but just helping them to each the room it is some of us some of us unsafe if you 'd look at the car park you know someone could easily roll an ankle or fall over there especially with the elderly and we 've got a lot of you so we need some help over to you mister we the pure official society would also like to highlight that we believe that the support in regards to getting brightened back on track is not just at a City Council level that the councillors have been convicted by government this is an excerpt from the little hint that we should that the council should be working together with DCL in region to get happening I know that there would be a suggestion that is happening but the reality on the ground is that we are not seeing anything is not just a group of New Brighton residents coming to complain this has been ignited by the government as being a significant issue in a significant area good this last one is more in my own right um I don 't want to speak for peer for sure on this one but builders on the eastery and if we go back a couple of the stuff we can there 's people we 'll meet in the coastal would feel like this and but we don 't we seriously don 't want to be Mona 's all the time that 's how some people feel the Local Government Act of 2002 list of course as being avoidance or mitigation of natural hazards yeah to contain the avoiding them and many a census is too late because we 've already got hundreds of houses there but if we look at the next show it looks like this is what the mitigation of the East Ridge means in two parts the town on the left you 've got two-thirds of the of the sewage nicely done properly done on the right and 've got on the other side of it I don 't think that that is particularly suitable I 've heard multiple reasons while the why the history edge on the eastern side is a special special dynamic and all the other excuses but the crux of the matter is that if all you present here wanted to have equal treatment on all sides of the history there is equal treatment for all coastal residents that would happen and pronto my plea to you is say no say no to the official to manipulate your were tipped with techniques such as over costing land ownership issues delaying tactics such as the who and the hair comes consultation just get on and protect equally that is equally the five hundred families or twelve hundred people who call this area home please act now thank you now do we have questions Vicki thank you just to the P unfortunately society in terms of the rubbish which seems to have been an ongoing issue at Brighton for some time would you like to do a local contract or something we you easily take responsibility it be small payment will take I mean I 'm just I 'm just trying to look for solutions so that you don 't have to come back into the rubbish this certainly has been talked at a number of community meetings that I 've been it that funding was evolved from Council and we were able to perhaps employ a local person to do that could be so that we would concern I think that he unfortunate they have been submitting mainly however in regards to the freedom camping area um and I think that 's quite you know quite a different thing than the general mall area simply because freedom campers are usually moving on from our space so they I mean I have actually discovered nice full of clothes in that area so it 's not just your normal rubbish but a different kind of rubbish that they 're leaving there 's the normal stuff but these things that they 've used on the holiday and their holiday is finished and they are just literally clearing out their veins and leaving it 's a different kind of 't be part of the New Brighton Kosovan business camping contract as well you know we believe that really somebody could deal with a lot of issues at once I know that a lot of ratepayers would ask the question why should they pay for people who treat a suburb like their well because we 're host a Sophia 's hostess to you I know but I mean you know it 's kind of like saying that this is okay it 's not okay it 's not okay that 's reality but which is why I like the idea I like the key we came concept but I also like supporting local businesses and there is a there is a really good camping ground in South Bharata anyway Tim just following along from that you know like we hit the we 've got Mary wardens and we 've got that well we hear the guys in town if you did say like a close to Ward wouldn 't like that so the contract that we give or contracts we give out for say that the rubbish removal service in the a contract like that but expanded a bit because the figures are figure so don 't worry about that but the possibility of having someone or of staff members like a coastal warden will be far warmer and friendly as they then say a traffic warden yeah enforcing so I mean that you did quite right that it 's unacceptable we have people defecating and all that type of thing but to have that 's the attitude of how you do it hmm I think it 's absolutely why we suggested someone like a coastal camping ambassador that it 's a positive role so it 's more about welcoming people and forming people leaving people know the restrictions you know use somebody else maybe needs to influence them but we don 't even not even being the if we were to so Mary Darren would say that the contract with regards to servicing the bins and cleaning etcetera if they were part of it would you be interested and putting in a bid for that I think it would be fair to say and I know that many of you in New Brighton do feel that if we got adequate funding that we would be able to do a lot of really proactive things but I 'm not talking about funding I 'm talking about a contract because at the moment we have a number of contry I will service so if we hundred a contract for service so you 're actually deliver it 's not a it 's not a grant or a funding to community board or whatever but is actually for a specific role absolutely it has been pointed out to me in recent days that although we have a toilet in Thompson Park there 's no signage though actually so that 's one there so and that 's sort of right across the road from where a lot of this freedom campaign does appear but there 's no actual silage to say toilet there might be multiple so there 's no toilet sat both extreme ends of the freedom camping area their own one the one that Dame 's referring to and roughly domain is questionable right it 's the yeah I 'd rather they used Thompson Park I 'm sorry it took it back it 's pretty shyly iced my kids prefer to go home when we 're at the park yeah and to use that facility and the other ones the other toilets at the other extreme are the ones under the under the pier yeah have you talked to DCL also about the desire for the desert redesign of the areas south of the pier no is it worth dying with well I think people for sure have spoken to DCL about just about everything under the Sun and dads didn 't Brighton but um currently we you know there 's a lot of focus on the hot spot water pulse so it 's the conversations if they need it right but I 've just wonder whether it 's something that could be included in that wider design I think the healthier yeah if I sit in my personal the flip there are so many agency yeah so many things makes a big frustrating to know who to talk to about each if I could have actually had the decision that would have sorry I forgot your name from oh thank you yeah it would be good for us to get some information back around the D cell order of the maintenance contract so yeah but just in terms of toilets I was quite surprised the ones that the children 's playground a lot at night is there any do you think it would be worth those open or is there reasons why they closed quite early at night this there 's a lot of reasons for why these things happen but I don 't know how practical yeah I think that if there is adequate lighting and maybe security camera footage if that 's what 's what people are worried about then absolutely those facilities should be yeah they just in what bring you the Fletcher 's toilets yeah how much time have we got you 've got one minute in 33 seconds I just like to finish with a very quick analogy I think that the way that council DCL and really need to look at New Brighton is that the city is a family and there are what seven Ward what happens in a family is that when stuff happens you deal to the kids who need it it 's like imagining a you have a family and two of your children get diagnosed the really serious illness so you use all of the resources and out to help those children you buy the business look here you feed them to be start and of course you know it 's really important because you are a family that everyone either and everyone pulls together what 's happening with New Brighton is that in the central city they 've been identified by government as areas that are so they need some assistance what is happening at the moment as there is a feeling that some of these agencies in some people some staff within these organizations have a feeling that things need to be equitable and rather than looking after though who are sick at Tsang well look here 's the money we 're gonna split it evenly you guys go and buy your new car get some new wardrobes and we 'll use this money for the sick heads for new care and they don 't get it they 're to go around Chevy because they 're using our family money on just you know on the recovery so I think that if we could as a council as DC police yellow region could all come together and say this is a family thing there are two areas the central city in New Brighton that have been identified as unwell it 's well yeah New Brighton as and the letter of expectation because of the City Council not because of the central government yeah so we we insisted that New Brighton was part of that story of the junii from the city to the sea which the now green spine as opposed to the red zone represents so very much a big part of the regeneration of the city as a whole so your message certainly has been heard and will continue to be heard so thank you very much yeah thank you thank you I 'm surprised about no questions about the history well I mean we 've heard a number of submissions on it so we do understand that 's caught up it 's of residential red zone area we 're not the decision-makers at the stage so but we 're certainly part of the process I actually liked the whole process because it enables the community to have a real say about how they want to be engaged but you know we haven 't had a briefing from the how group Bute and I 'm hoping that we will get to do that sometime very soon but I know that regenerate Christchurch want to come and brief the Council on where they 've got to so far and we will obviously take that into account but we are not the decision-makers at the front end of this process I 'm hoping that we will have more of a nun floor and says the process proceeds thank you _"

member of civil defense like others one is concerned at the continuing rise of city council take but not understand the huge we do understand the huge need in our broken city is one of the contracting business it is a my role to ensure that those performing such contracts work efficiently and complete such contracts on time and to specification and how much of the quality it will wreak there off squarely at the feet of the City Council supervisors for poor quality jobs footpath relay and eliminates that laminates off jobs that need rework soon after completion Road real a bottle repair recently I called a member and a number of pothole repairs some occasion when I called to chase the job I was told her staff have been twice not to find the hole this hole would miss annoying any car that ran into it that 's why my phone number was taken at the time and they could not find it surely a call to my phone communication was the essence of it it was only 300 meters from the site would you believe that got repaired and then ten days later the supervisor called I swear the job was only for me to tell him that it was already done because of this I don 't bother to report such I have the city isn 't today coming in from faster buat Hospital the exit from the bus park is poorly designed the fact that if the buses are not careful front corner of the bus gouges the road and in fact there is a cavity being formed at the moment which is similar to the cavity that is on the left turn how of Rothesay radon to burrow and I have reported these for time and again many years ago threshold to be installed at the 50km icon Preston 's wrote the quotes work from a suitable contractor who could do it for about sixteen thousand dollars but now only the City Council approved favored and chosen could do the work which we were advised would cost about 40,000 surely with some competition city council worked the ratepayers funds which stretched further back in April 2016 are rated at City Council a local MP about condition of roadsides in Murray Harbor wood they were intersected by the dairy where they intersected by the dairy and Hospital in relation to the congestion safety and parking with bus access issues Council on both the dairy and number two seven four words of South of the roundabout where the bus stops on the basis of Health and Safety I raised the issue that there should be a cut in parking head into the curbside and I made the suggestion at the time about twelve months ago a new curve was installed in Berea Road opposite the dairy and nothing was listened to nor the City Council and all the NP returned my correspondence completion we see the areas again managed there 's photographs which I spent in with my submission people are still parking on the yellow lines and damaging the ground and no do eventually will ruin the footpath the game how can we better use residents ideas paid Supervisors of City Council and contractors be made that better communication of irrelevant and City Council be made rework is not required practical suggestions are implemented suitable less costly contractors can be used and paid staff actually work paid I saw two staff members sitting on the fence by the library by the hospital fence all day recently while work was being completed on the opposite side yes everybody needs a smoke a break but why do we have people sitting waiting while work is being done i think that 'll probably cover as much as what i need to say thank you thank you very much particularly interesting thank you for going to the trouble of making a submission it does make sure that you tune up so thank you for that it 's just concerned about the the bus damage in just describe that a little bit further yes if we look at the new entrance that was made at the where the buses go into the board car park the hospital car park is nicely formed with a proper apex comes out from the curbs to a point where the bird road runs straight through and it 's been formed like that so that it is more or less level right there was nothing done to the exit where the buses come out and turn left and go back on their way so the wheel of the bus comes down and whatever they call it the angle of the wind the front of the bus such a long overhang the buses need to go on an angle out of there and go quietly because if they go fast right hand corner digs into the bitumen as anybody that goes past will see has been repaired and is needing a repair again right okay look thank you very much for your submission that 's incredibly helpful I 'm sorry that you know the the response that you 're getting isn 't sure that our acting chief executive will be making a note of those those matters so thank you very much for coming thank you _"

    "text": "okay so we 'll just move on to the first one and Krista ensley good morning welcome Oh somebody needs to switch your my oh no it 's on now thank you making a submission on the heath get fairly other he expressway and I 'm hoping to contribute to the argument of bringing it all would your next year I live in Heathkit and have two kids and he 's got Valley School and think he 'd be great place but and I just and really would like to see the the expressway and be forward but and I just a little bit of a company interest I post really disappointed about him they 're swayed forward laminates dispose you before we before I want to talk about just the other couple of things which we 're principally about children and road safety and I think I 'm about the Heathkit Lynwood relationship and a little bit about wood high school so the only way in and out of um Heath get is this expressways and going through fury road and then going up streets and and neither a to it in order to access Lynwood all four people from land were or East Christchurch to access Heath get is really a long road and still not very friendly to children and if I think about you know those roads and I went and rode them and long watered them and recently in they 're covered in stones and tracks go past and you know for children who can easily make a mistake on roads I think it 's like for a parent it 's a terrifying prospect to moving around city with Jim and I personally really love dragging my children out for recycle despite their protests that they 're going to die or they hate cycling and never want to do this again but but all those but I think it 's a great time to connect with families for families to connect with their children I love to go to school and school and and I personally have great memories about them cycling I grew up in tow port and I firstly have great memories of cycling um from my home tutto had a high school for people to cycle along and I remember being very envious about kids cycling to school on the day of cyclone Boulder and really envious about that they got to do that but until I got dropped by my parents in the car so that 's the point I wanted to make about sort of road safety and I think like in my two children I 've got a 8 a 9 year old and 7 year old and the 7 year old has some learning problems and some big problems with his attention and I just think that he wouldn 't cope with any of those roads as they are and I 'd really love to see him do that and I think that these notice sort of so I have that my work and child me to health and and I just and I just think of those kinds of children both and heat but also in East Christchurch where it 's just a bit more is a greater level of deprivation in it and I think that is the theory of crunch can access such as the just great things on offer and therefore children and families and a cycleways a great way for children and families to connect so I guess the so that 's a bit about the Heathkit Lynwood relationship that I wanted to talk about and then I think the bit about Lynwood high school is that you know it 's enhance itself and we like to think that my children could could go there and I would like to think more about that but I 'd like my children to be able to cycle the air and excellent safe route and I think teach believe for people who don 't live in that East Christchurch I think that there 's something like a cycle route would enhance them and her our thoughts about um Dylan with high school and I think there 's just so much to be gained gain from those experiences my experiences are biking to school have done Steve me and have them shaped me I really love cycling now and I think it 's a great thing so that those that those are the key things I want thank you very much does anyone have any questions very clear and indeed look thank you very much and thank you for going to all of the trouble one to make this motion but to come and Pearson and to reinforce them just thank you _"

    "text": "Aster 's John Peterson but a company by pieter big is it right yeah we saved the best of last nice to see you John big for Bishop oh you heard it here first [Laughter] yeah well I 've sort of for my own protection I brought my priest anyways I 've got to read it this time right in 2001 the minister of senior citizens was a young lady called the chi launched the New Zealand positive agent strategy I know you 've all read it the a before that she asked me if I would serve on the reference group that would put this together so it 's a lot of work on into this and from page one of the strategy it 's about participation older people carrying on working and participating in the community and using the skills and expertise and experience and being recognized for the contribution and these are the themes right way through the book it says the positive agent strategy is expected to improve opportunities for older people to participate in community and to ensure that the government policies support the same is one of them you were signatories to this strategy so that last line should read to ensure that government policies both central and local support its aim now 17 years on to now that it picked a few outlets seven years on Oh that people wanted to downsize that home should find that options are over limited we know many places we find smaller houses these days and retirement villages I 've got no problem really with with retirement villages and a lot of people are very happy living there but what about the people who want to live in the community of all ages and carry on participating in the community what about people who cannot afford to go to retirement villages changing a little bit here as well you know what burden you city center we have noticed it 's great just walk through this afternoon it 's looking terrific but it 's not being billed for the older generation see planners planned for what they 're known and no one knows what it 's like to be an age older than themselves so how can the 't have any 80 year olds and that planning approaches you need to talk to us when Lord and yet eighties there 's gonna be far more people laid and what there are now so look at the your welfare when I mean when my wife and I got married I was nineteen sixty hey let 's just put up with me for what 58 is but then the average age for us men was sixty eight people retired at 65 and nearly seventy percent of all was died within the first three years seventy percent well that doesn 't happen now most people who are 65 have another 20 years or more to go but three so this is this is why the eighty pluses of fastest-growing age group so we that we you me all of us we should we start really planning that now so I think we need to take another look at this strategy we should do what my computer keeps telling me you know update then press the restart button so the strategy is a national oh gee unfortunately it 's been forgotten fact so I think what we need is a local strategy we need the Christchurch positive agent strategy that 's owned by us the people of Christchurch and not run from the corridors of power up and Wellington when we 've done that we can update the communities in the city it 's being hammered over these last few years and with no press the restart button so really what I 'm saying here well probably not make blame but a difference to me but I 'll make a hell of a lot of difference to a lot of you so I rest my case thank you 47 seconds to go did well Sarah thank you so much for it um one of the things that occurs to me is we spend a lot of time at the moment deliberately trying to engage with the youth because this is the city that they 'll be living in for the longest from now if you like but what we haven 't done very well is deliberately engaged with those who have a time and age and older and some make the effort we don 't deliberately engage the other way around and we have a Youth Council we have a strategy we have a range of things where we deliberately engage on you know long term plan those kind of things is that something that you would like to see happen at the other end of the scale as well to hear it say get the feeling that people are saying but it 's gonna take a long time for the city to be built yeah so now they 'll be living then but you 're gonna be my age then talk to me I 'll tell you what it 's like being mine so you can plan it for you yeah but the positive agent strategy takes in that whole thing of being yeah everybody together you know they 're not the group their truth even stranger to other things in the meantime you and and just start straightaway it 'll develop a strategy as well yes yeah we don 't have because sometimes the strategy takes a while to develop you just need to yeah there are other councils that process and I know Hamilton does straight away so okay only because you 're pleased bless you my view thank you I just just this I don 't know where this is still hanging around 2001 but you 're a part of all this yeah it was I mean I was the minister you were the boss yeah I was gonna be the Minister for youth is now I mean it 's still relevant now and so I think that following on from what John said to really think through what positive news analogy looks like it 's read the document and I would really really encourage us to embrace it I 'm a lot younger than he is but I 'm very much aware that you guys were younger than I am and it is talking about you and we 're talking about our kids and grandkids and we 're building a new city that 's got to be for everybody all generations and it 's not looking that way at the moment all right well what I 'm going to do is before I leave here I 'm counselor so that they can see it and and we won 't follow up on that thank you very much for your submission it 's a good way to end the evening thank you we invited onto ah prize gosh that could be very expensive shuttle thank you very much 18 to give the policy yes oh no the aging together we must it okay all right now um I forgot to adjourn the meeting so right I 'm a journalist meeting and still 11 a.m. on Tuesday _"

    "text": "so could I invite Philippa Rutledge to come for please for me and listening to the previous speakers sobering experience just giving you some examples of our cutters but I do know obviously that there are people bread truck terrace obviously it 's a lot worse than ours but the point of me showing it is to support the council 's view that that we do need some work on on gases and we were just a long form a whole lot of work that was done on a new sewer thing and just struck me that it would have been relatively easy to have redone the gutters just along as well so you know sort of thinking and programming in somebody else seed and putting these things together is a lot better than having to come back again and again or in a lot so yeah we 've got as you see those old fashioned gutters which are difficult for people to get across which block cap quickly and yes do obviously a lot particularly not functioning efficiently and will be on somebody 's program at some time but didn 't extend a bit further my submission that thought and I also support the comments that a previous speaker made about strip demonstrations or cycleways because I travel down there most Saturdays and I can see the issues that are developing for traffic from the creation of that cycle way and I do feel for the people who live in those townhouses down there who have off street parking obviously the people that will be going to visit him and if they need new smaller any people like that they hope it doesn 't seem to have been much thought about that I was motivated by and my concern about the heritage so I know that the cathedral is a divisive issue I have to say I 'm an Anglican although a bit embarrassed about it at present but that building that the federal is important to me on has personal memories to me my grandfather 's funeral was there and he was the flag bearer when the South African War veterans flag was laid up so whenever I entered that building I remember that and I used to there so I 'm one of the people to whom buildings are important and I just want to support the council 's role in that and I was absolutely delighted that the council made the decision that dead transport issues I speak as from experience as a pedestrian I walk to work most days but if it 's wet I bus or catch or take my car as a plea for thinking about with the car parking for the elderly I 've had to ferry elderly folk around to the hospital that cannot be long distances and some of them the memory is a little bit looser than it used to be and so you can 't necessarily drop them off safely and go and find a park and come back and expect to find them where you leave them and of course I know that the staff around the hospital have real problems with car parking I went and saw the council staff when they were developing the new roading system forced so one Street and around heavy Avenue and I raised the issue about hospital staff and car around the corner at that stage and the answer was well that can cycle they can catch the bus which the hospital is in the center of the city from it all well we 're and so you 've got to provide for the elderly who are going to be visiting Lee friends in hospital and you 've got to provide for the nursing staff that 's it thank you got time for a quick question of someone do you want to repeat your question I mean I guess that the the idea that the community board have an allocation decision over there over repairs that don 't fit into the major program of works yeah I mean one of the downsides and people don 't sort of kind of see this around the scoop program was that if it was part of the what was being paid for that it got done if it wasn 't it didn 't get done and this the council put money on budget for it but they didn 't come and ask for budget for it unless it was putting on a bigger to the work that they were doing they didn 't come with that bigger picture in mind I know that yani raised at a squillion time so I 'm just kind of repeating it again and hopefully now that that programs over we can do a lot better with coordinating between all of the different agencies that go into the ground you know I 've been caught out myself with Orion going into the into the footpath and the same street they enable when were less than 18 months ago so you just ask yourself we could do better than that so thank you very much and _"

    "text": "okay Antony Doyle Oh Antony Dale sorry I 've got a little note saying Internet dales last name is wrong on the run she says it 's table so I apologize I should read my notes Rachel Terrace so the halls will Hornby record and community board has already included to note about this and their submission and I prefer the council to this submission as well also not to think community board for making that submission on our behalf it 's very much appreciated personally what I 'm quite concerned to see that the young Rachel Terrace upgrade has been dropped from the long term plan budget yet again with complete lack of consultation with either the results or the community board and this happened after we were told at a meeting with council represented us last year that the upgrade was in fact going ahead so I 'd like to just do a quick slide show showing them as the state of though Rachel Terris Rachel tears just a little colder sick they 're 100 meters long behind the old briquette and shops Australian Road so there 's that road service was some re recovered just last year kovetz are in a pretty poor state some virtual terrace themselves about 80 or 90 years old and so I don 't suppose much has been done to the culverts in their time quite a bit of unfinished business around the pubes and coal bits as you can see and it 's a stormwater that 's in a pretty bad state and locks up because of that failed hole that are in the picture there and as you can mention after 80 years the Kurds are pretty much ready to be replaced so where we were unhappy to to hear about the defendants yet again of the upgrade because it with this latest full-year delay as it seems on the plan we 're looking at 11 years since the words Rachel Terrace were first mooted now many Mira you raised the point that there are the streets and Christchurch in worse condition however the the council have already come spent a large amount of money on storm water and wastewater upgrades in Rachel Terrace and I just wondered would it then you can not only not be bothered by us anymore but also you can chalk up another community outcome that the gradual terasaka rate was originally supposed to support so that that 's part of the council strategy of course so just point about the road surface the agency is coming into potholes and this was after was resurfaced just last year last year that 's in fact the third resurfacing in some 10 years or the road and I wonder if the point has been reached which it 'll be more cost-effective to actually reconstruct the road and get the job done properly just ketchup jobs as we 've had over the past ten years so yes we 've got a time for a quick question Erin yes so just around the prioritization of these and the question was in the LTP do you think that the community boards should be given the the job of choosing which roads are gonna get done and in which order I did pass the main road this morning that had been ripped up overnight which was when I drove down it resurface three run that doesn 't drive down there and it was fine yesterday and it 's up for one overnight all the big trucks are in there so should that should that have gone through Mike 's community board NIM said yes Ben the money here because we know this this and this or no we got some other priorities [Music] decide on these issues and surely they would take advice from counsel traffic engineers absolutely the staff would still put up all the streets but sometimes some local knowledge and can outweigh just what a computer spits out as the years of which roads especially post might because thank you very much for your submission it 's much appreciated sorry that you 've come back to argue the toss again so we 'll take that under advisement thank you so look we 've got two more submissions to go I would propose that we just continue or rather than take a ten minute break is that generally okay with people right _"

    "text": "Huey turn good afternoon welcome I 'm Huey zenana farmer pigeon Bay on the peninsula and I 've also been a farm consultant and rural barely worth for 30 years I 'd like to make two points and support of my written submissions and there are a couple of photographs that I 'll refer to on pages three one five and three one six on the agenda first ability is priorities for funding and I understand that you will have had a series of people here making submissions wanting to direct funds in different directions but my I 'm first point is that rural roads should have a high priority for funding they 're vital for farms and for rural communities and to use by Road pigeon Bay as an example we 're on share box road that runs two kilometers up from the pigeon Bay Road it rises about 300 meters in their short distance it 's a it 's a narrow gravel road with some wheel ruts that collect the rainwater that scoops up the gravel and cuts it down to the clay its services five properties and so we need it for access to a steep all the country farm and to get stop trucks to the yards neighbors who need to use it daily for example Dave and Amy Stronach at the top needed daily for his job as a Shearer for her part-time job and Ecker I and get their voice to school if the roads badly maintained and becomes impassable and with weather we and our neighbors can 't function so for us it 's a top priority and we hope that the council recognizes this and long-term point two is some about the standard of maintenance of rural roads so in order to keep the roads in good condition and actually to save long-term costs and I feel they need to be regularly maintained and to use share box riders or not as an example again until Friday hadn 't been graded for about 18 months there are stormwater gullies down the wheel tracks and it 's been graded flat so there 's no way that runs the wrath of stormwater can run off the sides on Friday after I made the written of the road was covered with sharp gravel with big stones in it and I came home on Saturday morning and found the neighbor Amy 's Karen on blocks at the bottom of the road missing two wheels because she got two patches coming down the hill to take the boys to rugby and her husband came down the hill too risky here and got another picture of his own so from my experience of about 30 years of living and driving on gravel roads they need to be graded at least twice a year they need a high crown with a camera down to a good clean water table to take away storm water and the capsule needs to supervise those contracts closely but to make sure that the contact is like Fulton Hogan they 're doing what they 're instructed and appropriate workers stand so briefly and to me enter up to my neighbors and country rates are a high priority for funding information ins and from my experience regular and supervised maintenance in the end saves long-term costs Angela thank you very much for your submission look as if staff say have to come from Christchurch right over the hill will then go back the same day so I 'm just wondering who could do this job described who live on the put into it Jonnie thank you what is interested to get some sense of the timing of when the maintenance got really bad it are you talking just in the last sort of few years or is it does it go back longer than that a little over for 20 years and it seems to teach they 've come going back gradually that 's just just an opinion I don 't have anything objective and the key to keep out about the maintenance really is regular nice and it 's not coming in once a week thank you very much for taking the time to come and make a submission we have received submissions on the gym generic subject before and I have to say these roads look like other roads we 've looked at so that 's certainly a powerful impact when you can bring them a tree like that so thank you very much for doing so thank you Antony _"

    "text": "michael morton ah first thanks for letting me talk to the counselor and make some points I am a research scientist and also an environmental activist previously in the States and now and then also presently on the board of Port Hills Park Trust which managers Mount Vernon so I have some interest in the International Hills is the rest of the city so I just like to make a few comments mostly relating to environmental issues now the first environmental issues that you are all very well aware of of course is climate change and especially when we are talking about long term plans that could be you know years and decades into the future climate changes like every aspect of life and so I think that there should be a deliberate policy of the council to consider climate change explicitly in every major decision or planning especially for the long term is conservation land and I know that City Council has a shortage of funds like everybody else I would still like to recommend that if possible to for the city council to buy as much land of the bank comes and goes but if you buy a piece of land narrations so it 's very important to invest in that as possible an example is understand that near the top of mom ever land will be available for purchase and this is a very special around here and it should be possible so I recommend when it comes up to another general aspect of importance is to preserve biodiversity and for example this can be helped by planting native native plants local renewal of plant species in colonies so because if if these gullies are planted that can stop or reduce the transmission of sediment and also chemicals and so on from the hills to the waterways including the head coat river another way to assert biodiversity is maybe to educate the public in a more intense way about planting just local native plants and especially endangered or space species plant to plant make this plant infuse them in backyards and in gardens around the cities they can be very decorative and they are very appropriate to preserve that way and finally another issue that is probably climate change we all know about greenhouse gases and the sources one of the important sources of greenhouse gases which is not very cognized is carbon organic carbons at wizard now actually around the world soil has more organic carbon than more carbon than the oceans or atmosphere so it 's a primary source of greenhouse gases and to the extent possible it requires more study especially the grassland mechanism of grassland story and the making carbon is something that 's very important and including in this area so I recommend more research more attention to that as far as pet if possible so that we can reduce this Domitian 's from from the soil carbon even a small fraction of a soil carbon if it 's emitted well thank you very much and I mean obviously all areas prepped up when you see that man who that could potentially be on the market so you know I mean I 'm sure you 're sufficiently well-connected to give a city and subdue some investigation from the scene but but if you do hear of anything that you know you know that the council would want to seriously consider thank you very much _"

    "text": "Michael Shepperd good afternoon Mike shepherd I haven 't come really asking for anything other than to reiterate a point which I think seems to get lost with all the money that everybody keeps talking about and that is that my original is that it I 'm not sure how long people can just continue going on thinking that we can put up rates by 5% 5% and 5% at some stage you 're going to drive people out of the suit yeah classic example which I noted in my letter was that we were ago my wife and I bought a brand new townhouse and everything for our retirement we can 't afford to live the air free retire on the pension because the council wants close to 40 percent of the annual money I get from the government to pay its rates I I don 't have a silver bullet to fix it but I think that the fact is that we we need to start looking outside the existing square you know some of the things that that could be looked at our relatively simple we 've and chat start charging for water that way the people who are using hardly any don 't get pay much and the people who are so then people get to make a decision if you 've got six or seven people in your house how much you use if you 've got a big garden how much you use but instead of impacting everybody with huge rates you start giving people a choice I don 't even actually have a problem with the fuel tax as long as the fuel tax interacts on rates then people make a decision if you want to drive around in your car you put petrol in it you 're helping to pay for the roads and everything else but it 's got to be reflective on the other side of the point in other words it 's got to come down the rates leading people make a decision unlike the last person who finished offers submission with suggesting that selling assets was a bad idea I 'm going to go totally the other way and say that I own a business tonight I live real world we have to say things like we can 't borrow any more money we need to reduce our debt we need to look at we were going I 'm not suggesting that the council goes rushing out and selling its assets but there 's nothing to stop the council floating 20 or 30 percent of some of the big assets and when you float an asset there 's nothing to stop you putting tags on some of those assets so you could keep it in New Zealand ownership you 're going to own 70% of it you 've got total control of it the amount of dividend you 're going to lose might represent a 30 percent loss in dividend but the actual cash input that you 're going to get now is going to allow a lot of work to be done so that the impact of the earthquake get fixed because again after seven years at some point in our lives we 've got to stop blaming the earthquakes for all of our problems you know we 're seven years down the track yeah we 're blaming youth quakes again I just think that we need to get we need to start thinking out of square and we need to get a bit radical and just stop putting out a nice brochure with some grape and flesh numbers around a circle and then asking do you want this or do you want that and finally I 'm not going to take too much your time we 're a city of 400,000 people do we need a thousand parks do we need 20 libraries do we need 30 swimming pools it would appear that we have a whole load of little wards around the city with a whole load of little council blocks who come here and they all throw their hats in the pen and they all want their money and their locals want the swimming pool and they want that swimming pool and they want a new park and they want this humans at the end of the day does it really matter if you 've got to drive 20 minutes to a swimming pool or 10 minutes to a park or if it 's moving houses to where the swimming pool us because everyone you build costs hundreds actually now it seems to cost millions and millions of dollars and then not only that but after that year in year out we 've got to staff it we 've got to clean it we 've got to maintain it we 've got to cut the lawns I 'm afraid for me my my plea is not so much for me my plea is for people like my son and his wife and their one-year-old daughter because if we don 't start raining things and shortly you 're gonna start driving people out of the city we cannot small businesses even business cannot keep just putting up wages hugely each year so they can afford to pay council rates so all I 'm here for is a plea I just want to show you that a simple ordinary rate payer to see is prepared to take some time and come in and say please please think outside the square thank you think it 's a very powerful submission and a salutary reminder to all of not the wards the city grew so thank you very much for your contribution _"

    "text": "um Julie is a toe bell-to-bell yeah thank you good afternoon everybody and thank you very much for allowing me this opportunity so I am Julie to Belle and although I represent an advocate for Sommerfeld community namely some of our residents Association this submission I have done solely myself but on behalf of their needs and I 'd just like to reiterate my submission this epic needs a more important than once at just stage and I think safety has to be a big element of a consideration and many I 'd like to consider like some types of straight hate to be reviewed I would request veteran straight be reviewed as far as safety goes Sokka where 's is great I 'm great if a cut cement I think it 's great that we give our community in our young youth on bikes and they would like typical that we have more of a balance for our view of all our modes of transport so it includes cars cycles pedestrians buses and I feel that there are a few safety issues that I 'm stuck going straight there of the red arrows either way so I just like to aspect both consideration be governed to ditch Street other sock away streets of being done well and also as a nurse I like to evocate that these streets that we are remodeling in the next year 's be adaptable for emergency vehicles I think a lot of the streets that have been constructed at the moment remodeled are actually not very user-friendly for emergency vehicles and also for town for businesses to access to bring and big trucks so so also on behalf of our community like to imitate that maintenance and repair of existing maybe older areas be looked after a bit more and that would include the likes of cinnamon and symmetry which here 's considerable drainage problems and it has some of the residents association meetings we have a wizard or two consistently comes to our meeting concerned about the knack of drainage which implicates on the properties also the likes of some of your pack in those older packs that need to be remodeled in had new toilet units that are at with today 's subdivisions and families around the city but I think that it 's just something about older areas need attending to also and that might be getting rid of the old gutters that our safety risk again and it might be putting underpin lining on things so it 's not just looking after their new city and the new suburbs but also the other older suburbs and also as part of feeding looking after error and modes of transport is that bustles in Summerfield as some of you may be aware Sommerfeld is lacking a suitable bus service that 's going through there at the moment and under consideration there might be a considered trial of a route that would go through summer field and also an important thing being a nurse is that our hospitals are connected and that and well mr. dents and we have a growing elderly population that they are attended to and that might be through a bus route that goes from Princess Margaret Hospital to crush each hospital to the city and it could even go past and George 's and the into boomers in go to the east side so it connects the whole lot through so this is my proposal unfortunately I didn 't and get a copy of a stroke proposed throwing better so I 'll just put that in there so it just it mostly I think that our bones I would ask that they be flexible and safe and and now for all modes of transport and pedestrians and it 's not done one way in particular another idea I had was that cyclists could be encouraged to head vicious cycle safety education about regarding using lights and things that might there are concerns about that so I 'd like to encourage their Tory has offered funding in fact up just who today for youth and I think there would be an awesome opportunity to encourage cyclists that we want on the road to have peaceful cycle safety education and that way we will get more cyclists philosophical ways as well well Julie look thank you very much and even though you 've made a personal submission you certainly have been a very powerful advocate for your community I 'll 're up to and and you 've been consistent on that and you 've also submitted on the bus routes through to the joint public transport committee which i sat on with a couple of my colleagues and and i know that you will have submitted and ii will be submitting when we get to the public transport changes that will be proposed but we dream of taking over the buses from our the city but one day so thank you very much for coming in and making your submission thank you thank you _"

    "text": "router engram now this is a number at page three to seven with people have been very helpful when come on earlier just to put on some of the gaps thank you very much for doing that thank you so my name is Roger Ingram I 'm coming to you with sort of three runs in Christ Church is a young person in Christ Church I 'm the youngest tram driver and our cam fleet so what I recommend and I also volunteer air-cool degree which is just at the mouth of the history and city as well so that 's why I 'd like to talk about today sort of a summary of what I 've made in my written submission is well the first thing that I want to talk about is that the priorities in assets should really be about Christchurch 's identity as a city I say that in the sense there Christ Church has taken a very big hit in the last seven years don 't even need to mention it but we have who have come a long way and we need to be interesting in its own right so when it comes to debt there 's the first part of the submission came was asking about the progress who have been making in terms of Christchurch New Zealand and the events we run in the city what I think is really important is the stories of Christchurch it gives people would be a place in the city and this really comes through as my wife as a tram driver what really encourages tourists and the city and locals alike as hearing the really interesting quirks about christchurch and what what our history is and where we 're going I think story is has always been a very important feature and New Zealand history the oral history of the modern people has always been a very grounding component and so when it comes to events I think we I think it 's most important to focus on what makes Christchurch interesting I think stuff like the red zone six which is taking advantage of the red zone unique to Christchurch that 's also encouraging activities that 's a sort of they know what to great event in that sense because Christchurch has this act linked with the Antarctic with Scott and Shackleton we 're home to the American Italian Antarctic projects as well so we have a lot of resources to draw on when it comes to what we can say about the Antarctic and our link to it we 've got that connection so things like that what I 'd like to see more focus on when it comes to event lift so just drawing in international things that don 't really have a link with the city now that when it comes to the stadium we do have a Bighorn capsule of Venus is just we mentioned in the last submission and there has been accommodated the likes of Bruce Springsteen a lot of dialogue going either way where it comes to a covered arena and I think that would be important in the future but for now we 've got something that is serviceable and we need to focus on building up to an international standard from our roots but we 're working on the convention center at the moment and international visitors little or in the next few years and I think focusing on these sort of things are building up our infrastructure from the ground up is where we want to go before we look at building a world-class stadium when it comes to the rate proposals I think that it 's fair as long as we stick to them I don 't think we should bring in targeted Livi 's which stick to the litter saying five point five percent but not really to the spirit of the commitment for alternative sources of funding something that I am concerned about is the water quality of our rivers so I thought a good alternative source of funding would perhaps be for our proposing Livi 's on developers as her developing say in the Westmoreland region where a lot of soap has actually generated an erosion which then ends up downstream it 's taking money off people on the east side of Christchurch where the water washes downstream influence the river and when it comes in flood protection what we need to do is I think keep that dredging to term measures rather than a short Effects of dredging the river long-term measures of mitigating that that soap buildup in the river so riparian planting thoughtful subdivision planning and yeah we want to take the River ecology healthy that is an asset to Christchurch on that note I think the funding of roads is something that would be given up to protect our prioritize there as well because the but we can take them add to the level of maintenance they are now but we also have to look at our underground infrastructure a lot of that runs under underneath the roads so I feel like prioritizing roads now doesn 't mean we need to dig them up later on to fix that underground infrastructure and a couple of positives I think the libraries are an excellent asset in Christchurch and something I 'm definitely looking forward to the opening up of the inner city library it 's a great way to get information about what the council was up to and of course the books one of the best parts of the facilities have gotten Christchurch in another source part of the assets such as the airport are to free up some funding now so we can focus on new investments that will bring stuff into the city and prioritize yeah one last thing that I think is extremely important the Heritage we lost 80% of our heritage buildings in the city and they definitely add to the city 's identity so when it comes to Christchurch it 's great to see but just on what 's the boulevard here we 've got number 69 Worcester Boulevard the little brick Georgian building which will be incorporated and the new hotel we 'll be planning out there so yeah that should be consideration when it comes to results consents making sure that those heritage buildings and incorporated as best we can and have that story still threaded through the

    "text": "very much could I invite Miri Hamilton who 's on the schedule at page three three three thanks for coming on earlier that 's much appreciated good afternoon thank you for this opportunity to speak it 's just an individual regular general submission and I 'm mainly going to summarize my written submission I would like counsel spending to promote a caring clean healthy environment for those who live here with emphasis on community involvement and helping poorer areas I really like much of the draft plan however as you say in your booklet we must get the basics right before fully committing to projects we may not be able to afford I would like to see the following moved up at least to the higher spend option one water both drinking and wastewater to housing and three carbon neutrality this is expensive and I think it is vital that the council has a really adequate finance the stadium needs to be put on hold I think that will release quite a bit of money I think we also don 't need alternative sources of funding including some sort of pipe renewals and a visitor tax I think some in the local government were bought wastewater infrastructure is as you say essential to the health of the city and its people I am really quite appalled that you 've proposed to put it on hold this even though it means pipes will deteriorate further there will be more overflows when it rains and as we miss the optimal renewal time it will cost far more in the future plus more contaminated rivers and even more polluted beaches and coasts this is really not acceptable and it is not really in line with towns those housing I think this is a basic human right and a core council responsibility some groups say there are we are 200 council houses short since the quakes if this is true it seems a matter of urgency to replace them the stadium I think we do need to defer till we have the basics fixed frankly I wonder if we need it at all look at the needless experience six years on and still running at a loss to the City Council who now need is benefited mainly it seems the accommodation and hospitality industries not infrastructure parks or life others and it would be even harder for us as we would be competing against Dunedin it would need ongoing effort ongoing rate payers support I somewhat objected to my rates being sucked up in this way for Sarah we have or soon we 've had plenty of central venues an excellent Town Hall cultural precinct variety of theatres the horn castle arena was big enough to host the netball World Cup seems to be good enough for Bob Dunne the ami stadium seats 18,000 for sporting events surely it cannot be top priority to have yet more to carbon 0 I was really pleased to see it is council goal to show climate change leadership are there some official goals with targets and dates and yes perhaps it would be wonderful to turn some of the red zone into a carbon sink really encourage bus use with a bit of countin stick encourage clean low-carbon businesses local groups will have many ideas let 's get ourselves known as a city of greenery culture low-carbon of community input Christchurch will be a very special place for those who live here and for those who most certainly will come and visit thank you thank you we 've got a brief moment so oh sorry sorry sorry I didn 't that 's alright I was just going to say yes there will be formal goals around having your child eat right so thank you Mary can I just ask you so one of the things you 're supporting is it sounds like the social house and like the response you 're saying it 's a responsibility Council that 's at least Chris yes so so to restore that would you basically say look you want would like to see those that social housing restored yeah and instead and that 's a higher priority for you than it 's been a for a multi-use arena or Stadium yes thank you very much for your submission and we do actually appreciate when people go to so much trouble one to break the submission but then to come and present in peace and it does make a difference so thank you _"

    "text": "and then pull each way Paul great Paul summer though thanks for the opportunity my name is Paul Summerville chairperson of the edge web poor group I 'm here today to talk about the very long journey we 've been on for the past twelve years to realize our vision of replacing the much-loved edge where Paul you 've just heard from Brian you 've just heard from Brian about the amazing history of the spool the Swim Club the community and how the heart was truly ripped out by the totally unexpected and unexplained demolition I 've handed out some booklets their history books which have been compiled as a fundraiser for the pool and I would like to draw your attention to the back page where it says grateful thanks to those who scaled the wall after the demolition of the pool to retrieve the Swim Club historic minute books and poor management files without the section all these records would have been lost all of you around this table will have an interest in your local communities and histories you 're welcome to keep those copies and much time to read while you do all these submissions Emmett is selling them for seriously cuz I mean I 'd rather make a donation rather than 250 dollars right thank you we 'll put your name on the outside of the pool following demolition our group was formed two wards the replacement of the pool on the original side so far we have designed and costed the pool and last year the resource consent was granted and this might see me might sound easy but it most certainly wasn 't and it 's been a 10-year process after providing engineering reports on traffic impact acoustics lighting landscape reports requests for the colors of the buildings boundary setbacks recycle parks etc and then to have to go through the whole process repeated again because site boundaries were changed we were finally successful the total consent cost for planners consultants counsel fees was a hundred and fifty thousand dollars which was raised by our community please no please note that this was a public to be notified consent which met with the approval from all the surrounding neighbors and the affected status our membership represents the Suburbans community and that is the suburban Swim Club The Residents Association we have village business group and the sonoran school and they 're all represented on our trust so there 's a true Community Trust historically that 's an organ school make great use of the old pool and they have a membrane Memorandum of Understanding with us to use the new pool so so we have the trust we have the site we 've got the designs and plans we now have the resource consent and we have the customs that have been developed for a new pool the next stage is to build the new facility and we are very of course very supportive of the pepperiness community boards request of five million from this council in support of this wonderful community project we estimate that the cost of the project to date plus thousands of volunteer hours plus the pro bono work of professionals we the community have expended upwards of three hundred thousand dollars towards this project so far Edgware village is a vibrant hub the location of the pool two bus routes passing through the entrance and the pullers and easy walking distances of schools and residences we know the council has a sustainability policy and you have carbon neutral targets so placing community facilities to fit these targets bill sensible move the New Age report we right and half all the activity for many people there 'll be no need to drive via the pool will would purpose-built to meet our community 's needs the size and scale of the pool makes the construction more affordable to build affordable to operate and affordable for people to use the signs and scans such that it would not compete with council aquatic facilities and that is our intention it is just a small scale community pool planned to consist of both an outdoor pool and an indoor hydrotherapy pool which will cater for learn to swim sports groups and the disabled there will also be a community meeting room we we are sure the new Interpol will be a place where locals feel a sense of identity ownership and safety the pool will be operated to Menace by a trust we have a track record of successfully managing the original pool for 75 years and we can do it again since the demolition we 've maintained an active and well supported family-friendly local Swim Club operating temporarily at the Shirley Intermediate School pools it 's run by volunteers with huge success of teaching kids to swim the clubbers keep them keen to move back to San Albans to continue their long association with each with pool and after 75 years with a pool we know how to benefit of them strengthen our community a five million dollar investment would bring their benefit back to san organs we realize there 's a balancing act required by council to provide community facilities and we 've got no wish to take away from the desires and wishes of others however however we ask for equity with those other communities who are going to benefit from the new council own community pools and we suggest that council may be able to find savings of five million dollars for our pool out of the eight hundred and thirty five million dollars in its community facilities facility of appropriate we know this council wishes to encourage resilience and well-being in communities and to see active healthy and engaged citizens this project will do exactly that for our community so summer our community has not been sitting back waiting for the council to present us with the most expensive gold plated facility we 've been working really hard on cost-effective pool that is just right for our community it 's just right for our community with a huge passion commitment and progress that has already been made by the Sun orbits community and with this council support the is report could be completed and in the very near future thank you I guess the question that I want to ask us the question that I asked before so when we considered revoking the earlier decision of the council to sell the property to the pool group for a hundred and twenty thousand dollars you came to the council you said that it was important to have ownership so that you could fundraise and accepted that you wouldn 't be back to the council for more at the dollars it 's now five million and you want the council to pay for it all absolutely right pay for the pool we have probably put in about three hundred thousand dollars my money so far no but when you came last time I realized you see no additional money for you you weren 't gonna ask the council for money for the role I did say that have we agreed on that and that 's part of the agreement right I 'm here today asking for equity a change they 're very they 're asking for the agreement to be changed yes but I am back here near today asking for equity okay Sarah the simplest said I 'm sorry listen I wasn 't part of the previous count so when these things were hemming and I 'm just looking at your book and the amount of obviously community enjoyment and thanks from the support over the years we 've got a similar scale pull to the edge we won that was and Heathkit valley there 's a similar one and and Sumner and they 're all these ones just rolling the book goes on about the value of that and I 'm just wondering why you are now aiming for a larger facility when these neighborhood pools and school pools that serve the communities really really well tend to be more outdoor summer pause and why are you aiming for a larger pool now and indoor section rather than the old hole that you had the open air pool is the same sized original core and we realized that making it more viable we needed an indoor pool to teach the kids to swim so we can operate that facility all year round there was the whole purpose behind it was mostly what was always block already covered pool they could be used all year round so so more than what you had before in that 's right we had before but I just know that for example the summer Napoleone it 's enough thank you thank you very much for your time no I mean it 's got we 've gone over that the time thanks very much _"

    "text": "so do open a swimming club Brian Gardner you ready yes please madam mayor councillors yeah hi Brian garden the current president of the sonoran swimming club a life member the coach of a young swimmers I was also a member of the management committee before the council decided to take over the community course so thank you for this opportunity to speak to you on behalf of our club about the proposed rebuild of our port and its original site in the edgeware village just off of Edgware Road my submission is about making you aware of the history of the pool and all of the hard work and voluntary hours have been put in by our club members over the many years of its history I 'm not sure that you are aware there was a book written by our some of them that I think it 's been passed around they traced the history of San Albans club from 1892 to 2006 India in that book there is a paragraph from there is a photograph on page 16 of a letter from the council stating that the a site for the public for Republic swimming baths and in the press article on page 18 about fundraising efforts the words blend given by the council were used in the minute books there is evidence of the fun fundraising that took place and of the building I was fortunate to have met some of those elderly members that took part in those activities to raise the funds to build a pool when I first brought my children for training in the mid-1980s the main point I wish to make from the point of view of our swimming club is that the pool and all the buildings on that site that is the pool the plant-eating changing sheds Chios club house all the trees shrubs and plants were put there by the funds raised by our swimming and they were demolished without consultation approval of our club with no concert no compensation as a member of the pool management committee I can remember that we used to pay the insurance and upkeep of the pool that was helped by a grant from the council each year until the council decided that went into keeping the pool fit for use I can remember spending many hours helping cleaning and painting the buildings scrubbing down the inside of the pool helping paint it before to start the new season I also used to help tender lawns and gardens throughout the year our swimming club members were volunteering man the entrance to take the interest fees so ice creams and snacks and some of our senior nurse women with axes lifeguards for the evening and weekend sessions so what I can 't understand is how it was possible for the council to take over a pool on the land according to the letter from the council was handed over to our club to build a swimming pool for the use of the community project that 's many years of hard work and dedication of our previous generations of members and for it to be taken away in the way it was was heartbreaking for us the feeling of injustice was very deep in our community and that was shown by the street demonstrations and the many letters to the press at the at 2006 members of our club and community have been trying to find a way to reestablish the call back where it glows such as a big feeling of our loss that was felt in our community that is 12 years of dogged work there 's brought us to a point that we are ready to start rebuilding our beloved community Paul once again not only is our club being deprived of its own pool they had built and that 's a relocator the Shirley Intermediate School pool as there was no no room space no space for us at the ground condom pool but we met to raise a considerable amount of money in consent and legal fees just occurred just to get consent from the council to really establish a pool that we already had in my previous admission I stated that the pool was probably passing but we did have a quote that was very reasonable to fix any problems that could have kept our port open for another estimated 70 years and in science hindsight with the earthquake insurance we might have at the pool replaced you couple weeks ago and I call about the Forgotten suburb should have surely our membership is mainly drawn from the years of Shirley Maura Howe and some orbits as we offer affordable teaching coaching of swimming for families by reestablishing the pool close to our neighboring forgotten pieces of it we would not be completely with the patronage of Graham a condom pool because that 's over prescribed as I have to take my nearly three or our granddaughters Joe powerful essence because there 's no room there now swimming club built the boat on land handed over to us by the by the council for that purpose a history of over 80 years of occupation and is my opinion that you should recognize all the hard work of past and present generations and the loss our club has had to endure since your predecessors demolished what was right for the hours in my opinion the council should look to finding savings on other pool projects around the city that seem exorbitant to me because we have plan into costing set our pool complex can be built for around five heard for similar sized ones in other parts of City I repressed at the council consider righting the wrongs done to us and provide the necessary funds for us the rest we establish our pool back where it belongs as soon as possible thank you thank you can I just ask what what did the what did the actual agreement say when we transferred the property to for a dollar because the way I 'm reading the newspaper article at the time it sees as part of the agreement to sell the land for a dollar the council stated it would not contribute to the project and any other shape or form either to develop the initiative or to keep it running in the future was that part of the agreement about what the agreement is now but I 'm I 'm only talking about history there was a there was okay the title may have been still left with counsel but there was a gentlemen 's agreement that the land was handed over to us in any contract you know that is historical eighteen years of occupation of that I 'll ask the Knicks that matter I 'm Sarah thank you and it 's really interesting to hear the history I 'm not from that area so it 's um so it 's really interesting to hear that I was wondering how that um how the pole operated before it closed you talk about the Swim Club the Swim Club run it and operate it for a membership base always it open to the the general public sort of it 's sort of normal pool hours so the swimming club basically ran mostly we had a management committee who looked after you know we used to employ the staff we used to employ some lifeguards for the daytime but the rest of it was run on the voluntary basis you know like the kiosk was run by by members of our club you know as I say I used to do evenings and weekends I would be lifeguard we used to teach life-saving and we used to be competing but so it was open to the public and people would pay in those volunteers for you and what sort the council air time do you remember I think it might have got up to about 10,000 that 's something like that okay thanks you know you know it was very seasonable we only had an open air Pullman that mean so it was very hard to keep it running without the help of the council but we did we manage to okay thank you very much Brian because I 've heard parts of that story but I 've never heard at certain campus so so so with such an excellent summary really and that the whole history of volunteerism which you hear which certainly as a council we applaud of course what I wanted to ask about Brian was in terms of going forward you might be aware that the community at with with spray Dhin have recently managed to build a pool of themselves and they used basically it 's it 's built of steel that the the bottom in the sides it was what Beto so that and they so it was really would you talk with them to look at the technology they used and also that it 's the same company so you 've got all we 've got all the costings everything it 's all in place all ready to go it 's all ready to go there 's a parallel with we spray them they 're quite different in terms of what what happened but thank you very much clean thank you could you tell us Brian about the ethos of a community-owned Paul if you like as opposed to other pools tell us about the ethos the the sense of what it is to you know have that ownership of a pool like this as opposed to other other port we 're going back to community we can we can run that pool like we 've we 've been to the University we had some done an analysis of running cost an exam and without with our indoor teaching pool amazing that we can we can we can make enough money to keep that going without any help from the council in future and that 's where we come from that you know like edits the loss to our community was great fighting for that for our pool to be put back where it came from look thank you very much it 's a good note to conclude on so thank you very much for making your submission can we move on to the San Alban _"

    "text": "kaalia and julian Fallone presenting for sport canterbury welcome okay we 'll take our submission is really unconscious I 've only got 10 minutes to advocate for two three key things so I 'll get straight into it um I guess the first thing I want to make and the point I want to make is three years ago I said in front of you and advocated strongly for the opportunity that was presented with nappeun away at that stage I advocated that this was the number one sport recreation rebuild project for the city bearing in mind I 've got a lot of flack through the submission at the time from sports and user groups of the Metro because that was in their mind that number one but I 'm actually sure there was going to be a fate of complete three years on as of the middle of this year we 're going to have an athletics track to pocketers community fields for OB League and in time tennis courts and I often reflect on the the what 's really got me out of it over the last traveling as far as tomorrow to access earthly extracts young kids playing on hockey to that later night and no longer willing to do that and we 're going to have a home for every league and then time the courts that we lost it wild in Park will replace it in a pan away so I think it 's a celebration acknowledgement of us Council for committing to that project and three years on we 're going to have a fantastic new facility for sitting in addition I think there 's am also acknowledgement from you as a council around the Metro sports facility and the outcome recently we received to be delivered on its designated site to be delivered within the proper the current proposed scope and being supportive of making some cuts around the form elements as opposed to the function of sports so as a as a sector of representing the collective of sport in this earlier knowledge the council for the commitment and I know how tenuous it 's being on both projects at different times over the last 12 months to acknowledge you as Mary Richardson John for SEL kit David Bailey and Steve government your perseverance and commitment so I want to start off with acknowledging and congratulating council for that the second acknowledgment I want to acknowledge is this councils commitment to the greater Christchurch sports facilities plan and we applauded the Selwyn District Council 's submission around the consideration to a regional rates levy to help can contributing to some of these facilities in the regional picture keep in fronted the way market early dis accounts till last week in advocated for that council to consider along those same lines so again acknowledge this council for the commitment to building a more strategic approach to future development of facilities so again congratulations one thing I want to touch on and it 's been in the media over the last week or so is that our organisations submitted the round flat water to the regeneration plan and we advocated strongly for the consideration of a 2.2 kilometre after River option as part of the regeneration plan we as a sector and I think I speak on behalf of a number of user disappointed by that decision and as I guess a 50% share hold of a regenerate urge you to put that decision under scrutiny and possibly if we can if we can get it over the line and revisiting of that we had some conversations with regenerate on behalf of the sports last week and they felt that regenerate made the comment that financially it wasn 't a consideration technically it could be done and over submission through the regeneration plan supported the consideration to a flat water facility so I 'd like some endorsement or from our perspective to heavily look at that finally in terms of the stadium completely as a result of the review around the metro and the stadium was completely supportive of a standalone site and on the designated site that has been chosen we fully support the need for covered stadium and of funding permits a retractable perched to allow for a whole multi-use concept to maximize that from a functionality perspective we fully supported capacity of around 30,000 spectator mark and as identify with a know the greater Christchurch sports facilities planned that if 'm in terms of urgency for the stadium for s city in that region thank you thank you questions which the forgiven yes have to get on it women so I consider my position and I see there like I understand that the subject is a prickly one which the mere to you sitters and I put the position to see luck would likely to at least lead to their conversation and hit the conversation and there was too much knowledge meant that there is a topic that they need to address so there was no obvious commitment at the time obviously but it was received thank you for doing that it 's much appreciated yonni I 'm just two questions one is under 26 of your submission you talk about a conversation around funding mechanisms regionally for regional national sports facility developments but you don 't make reference to events you 've also endorsed spinning more for Christchurch indeed are you taking the message to those other or do you think it 's fair that we asked those other regional councils to contribute towards the events not just the made comment around concern of the existing san-based carpet fields and I just wondered if you could elaborate to that point as well on page five of your submission yeah sure okay so thanks counselor the tubes of the regional rep for events look to be able to hidden picks needed that thought process that fan but maybe it 's a discussion and see what options might exist and where might lean for that for the hard infrastructure so facility conversation around a targeted rate or whatever it might be but there 's no reason why it couldn 't be extended to the event some things because for the same reasons that the benefits again for a region that you have a major facility such as the Metro all that made it the stadium the same of the vents they bring benefit to the wider region so there 's no reason why principals couldn 't be extended but producing speech I think the context around the conversation was around the spaces and places facilities plan so it was always going to be around the Metro it was always going to we 've started coming up conversing with the Selwyn District Council around hockey chooses an example was the provision of to you know for cockatoos at night put away they haven 't been able to what they haven 't needed to let foster partly put in 2 RP 2 so those sort of conversations across boundaries they haven 't had to invest because just down the road as our two to bring in poppy to so that converse is an argument and the advocacy has been around the context of spaces and places as opposed to events at this stage and then on the other side of your question the sports fields so look we 're rule ane but even for motion we 've got from some of the sports fields users there the council invested significant capital in dating upgrading some of the fields for primarily at the time the kid list was the FIFA under-20 World Cup garrett park and over the apartment a couple comes to mind the understanding is that fact the maintenance on those possibly could do with a review or look at all perhaps technical the experts tell us that the same cover is only as good as well the way you maintain them and pets they are carrying as much capacity as they could if the maintenance was just keep up to date that 's what it 's about what a wider conversation to another point you make now submission is the start of course you see your counselor start leading a process around a sports parks plan nitwit plan and we applaud that we 're part of that conversation and we 'd like to keep pushing that through all right well thank you very much for your submission much appreciated and thanks for acknowledging the staff that have been supportive and helpful thank you _"

    "text": "that was my fault um could I invite me zealand rugby forward please hi good afternoon unless the chief rugby officer from New Zealand rugby I should first just extend an apology from Britain chairman and Steve to my chief executive they 're both on Rugby business and Dublin otherwise they would 've been here in person today right we 've got lots of hard questions for you just a first defense for the opportunity to present today in support of our submission of bringing forward the building of a monte sereno with the roof as part of the council 's long-term plan firstly New Zealand rugby understands that the city of Christchurch and the council are faced with competing pressures in terms of our community facilities and we deeply respect the tough decisions that have to be made we recognise the temporary AMI Stadium has served a good purpose at a time of urgent need but its limitations are well-documented and this has unfortunately meant that Christchurch in the Canterbury region have been missing out on major events including all baptise pitches the current facility generates less than 50 venue that hosts the test matches in New Zealand and in the current environment New Zealand rugby faces considerable challenges particularly with our ability to make to maintain our current player base in New Zealand to continue to support the community gained for this reason that it is just not possible to play fullback T switches in contemporary AMI Stadium on a regular basis we also understand that the ami stadium was designed to be debris structure than age amid the maintenance costs continue to escalate we therefore commend the city for recognizing the need for bringing forward the development of a multi new multi-use arena in the city we maintain that the final decision on design capacity roof etc must be made by the immediate stakeholders and not New Zealand rugby but would make the following points we support the crusaders in Canterbury rugby submission we believe a roofed stadium would be the best solution for rugby in Christchurch there is no doubt that Dunedin 4th Forsyth Barr stadium has set a new standard for a South iron venue and can have concerts rugby matches and other events allocated players and fans will be good as far as Test match allocation is concerned we have a long-standing policy in New Zealand rugby of spreading these matches throughout the main centres of the country in any one year we have six or seven Test matches and final allocation decisions depend on the capacity yield and commercial terms of hire in this regard it 's important to note that the first that the facility that is built needs to be available to hire in a way that works for both the venue and the horror all too often New Zealand stadia rely on commercial funding partnerships that conflict with those of the horror increasing the complexity of how a facility can be used we recognize you need to generate a reasonable commercial rental from users but encourage you in thinking about a stadium to structure the terms of hire and as simple a manner as possible because this makes the facility work for both the you user and the venue itself on a positive note we have an international program of Test matches locked in for the next decade a roofed desirable for Test match allocation and subject to satisfactory commercial Arrangements we would expect Christchurch would be allocated one test per year the same as for Wellington we also support the Crusaders arguments in terms of the need for a top-class home for the most successful team in the history of investing Super Rugby while the temporary stadium addressed the real risk to the future of the team the risk has returned as this temporary stadium goes past its use-by date I would like to conclude by reiterating New Zealand rugby support for the Crusaders and Canterbury rugby submission to bring forward the building of a multi-use arena with a roof as part of the long term plan we believe this would address the risks posed by the current temporary AMI Stadium as well as bringing sports and entertainment opportunities including Test match rugby back to the city of Christchurch thanks for the opportunity today and thank you well I think the first question is around you know the financial potential financial contribution from New Zealand rugby it is a question that we 've been asked by a number of the the concern about the increasing costs of having to bird against other cities for games in our own City I think contribute financially as by bringing games to Christchurch and using your facility on commercial terms we certainly would see that as being a given we 're not looking for a free personal life in terms of use of the facility would be looking to allocate games and in pay a commercial rate for doing so in terms of the the the tender prices for matches that 's far more about just ensuring that the council and the wider community are engaged so that when when our test matches played in your city the city comes alive our opportunities for fans your ratepayers and others to enjoy the opportunity not just in the stadium but in the water city and burns okay okay on that question the one where if you want to know black teas to get to bed for it against other cities in New Zealand so are you saying that a big part of that bed is the engagement of the community so what you actually very small part and and is that in terms of reference when you put out these beds yeah that the bid process is multifaceted there 's no no doubt that 's the the the quality of the facility and the yields that we get from playing in that facility as the primary thing of importance so as I 've said and my statement with a a roofed stadium of up to 30,000 seats you would be in a position with that facility to be pretty well assured of a test which every year what would be looking for in the and the wider discussions around their allocations you know just need to make sure that that the city is engaged and there are you know there are opportunities for fans both from here and from outside the city to be in fan zones to that the city is is themed for the test and you you 're really leveraging their opportunity that 's as long as we did that we wouldn 't have to pay any money towards a bird no your contribution to in terms of hosting Test matches roof roof stadium of the nature that 's being talked about you will have the the best facility of its kind in New Zealand at that point we don 't have to bet against the other cities there will be a an allocation process so strictly speaking you would be bidding but I can tell you that and in terms of our submission with this facility other things I can 't sit here and give you a cast-iron guarantee but you your your bird will lead to you hosting Test matches on a on a very regular basis in the same way that that that Wellington does well as in Auckland and Dunedin do Karen currently Jamie yeah things and things for taking time to speak to the submission Nigel just following on from there and obviously with the Forsyth Barr example there were there was some guarantees of Test matches put in there and I don 't know what you 've seen your submission I think is pretty powerful because you 've seen a lot worth it but if we were to be of mind to bring that funding be able to expedite the multi-use arena would the indeed are you be open to having discussions of potentially guaranteeing a number of tier 1 Test matches over a period of time there 's part of it well we we allocate tests which is over a number of years no you know it 's not inconceivable as part of that process we could talk to you about what that means the the only reluctance that New Zealand rugby has gotten terms of giving a cast-iron guarantee is that that means that some of the other things around engagement of a city with the fan zones and so on might fade into the background yes and you know I think with a city like Christchurch that has really engaged you 've already had had meetings with Joanna Norris and really exciting things happening in that space that as long as we know that this that we now understand the terms of fire we understand the commitment of the wider community to really get excited about it an event that 's what we 're looking through for through that allocation of prices aligned very good I thank you thank you very much and appreciate that that you were here alone today and for you know reasons others weren 't here I think you when we express the concerns that have been expressed and it 's right to put that to you so thank you very much for making your time available you 're welcome thank you I couldn 't _"

travel around our city um so first of all I 'm impressed to be able to address you on long-term issues 200 strategies because that 's well beyond the businesses like and political cycle times and so it 's just one of this tell you about my observations by recently traveled to Victoria and British Columbia in Sydney Australia and San Francisco as well and just looked at I was really I think that 's also professor of what we can do here and it 's all about dhoklas bicycles and the business setup around those and it 's just so struck walking down the streets in Victoria BC just seeing bicycles all down the street ready for anybody with their app thought I 'd walk and just ride away on and the same in Sydney the same in San Francisco and these are all businesses businesses that have started up in the last six months or so what 's striking I mean many things struck me about the dhoklas bicycles one is that it 's a business right it 's not like the docked bicycles here where they require require somebody to find them to get them going it 's these darkness bicycle companies are coming in and setting up a business that rich make a return on investment and its noticed by big players like uber who 's also making a play in this space as well and I just really feel like changes can happen quite rapidly in cycling being picked up and being used in Christchurch and separated cycling waves were being pushed out I thought wait a minute that 's sort of a pessimistic model of or business as usual I don 't think it 's business as usual I think especially with doctors bicycles but also electric bicycles and you also can see all sorts of technology for getting one person around on electric rollerskates or something is this one person they 're all with transporter so it 's dramatically different when I went to Sydney I 'll use these bikes a lot I was a tourist I just go in and my daughter say it was travel to the other end of the city we just hop on the bike New Zealand cellphone hop on cycle away to where we want to go and just be fight there and wander around go to the restaurant I 'll go see the yachting then hop on another bicycle that we just find laying around that 's that 's really a strikingly different model for cycling what 's also just doing a little research on this as well one of these doclets bicycles are really uber is with public transit transport where public transport people will take a bus into the city center they have to walk a kilometer or half a kilometer to work but if there 's Darko 's bicycle sitting there it 's just a amazingly simple and cheap matter just a typical bike like the right bike got last kilometer and and it needs a bike so there 's bicycles everywhere and then once this bicycle is everywhere what about safety we 're assuming I 'm looking can see an easy future in crisis just such an amazing city for cycling I mean I never live in such a perfect place for cycling what 's the weather 's pretty reasonable and this morning 's bit wet but flat you know we already have rules in place look can 't make turns on on red lights that sort of thing which is hinder its de cycling so we 're really in a position to follow the top cycling town 2017 mantra at the front there so I guess what 's that I saw in Sydney which was interesting they do have some bike place have bikes look at the piles or these dauntless bicycles over the place so what are people doing what I have observed was that people on a busy street you start riding the bikes on the sidewalk so as all these people riding moving around the pedestrians on the sidewalk because the road sisters are just too fast for them so we can do better than that in Christchurch we can have safe we already got plans for safe city separated cycleways and it 's a matter of timing I request the City Council prioritize the site thing you 'll be able to speed up putting me on cycle ways in place because I think we should be keeping pace with the adapt should adoption rate of cycling and not lagging behind because we 've lied behind then we 're totally making let 's say bird cyclists or tourists or riding bikes around here or families are out on a ride but they 're also just making it just making it not a friendly City for cycling I think we deserve to have good cycling and stay ahead and everybody in your city which is fantastic so that 's my pitch I just expand the cycle ways as fast and keep up with and keep up with technology keep up with adoption massive adoption of cycling to help reduce congestion thank you thank you any questions I said we had a number of submissions on that well a couple of submissions on Memorial aive do you see that as a particularly problematic road in terms of utilizing up for cycling at the moment it 's sort of that fiend Alton Road you leave the cycle way behind and or the cycle lane behind a new movement of my territory are there any other areas that you 'd feel a high risk you know so I mean it 's it 's just useful having somebody who say passionate about cycling and just query the areas that we might need to be alert to any place where there 's parking and there 's a lot of traffic traffic is there a plan to sock away in their area I 'm just I 'm just trying to think of these are planned one between Lincoln right and Martin right yeah no no I I can easily find it out but anyway and so you know I didn 't just ask you in Amer we 're really saying that to avoid the problems in Sydney around like real topless bikes but in fact if we put in good cycling infrastructure including separated cycleway so that 's the best way to to deal with the issues that arose and something is there what you mean yes yeah good people keen to ride bikes they just see them sitting there is so tempting I mean just get down the city block and you 're gonna pay a couple bucks yeah so you get on if there 's a pathway you can see the right on you just get on that start using it thank you sir thanks mate so you oh you were visiting is a tourist or visitor and using these binds did you were you aware of people sort of people who lived in the city using them as part of their commute ordered it seemed to be more sort of a sort of very good well look thank you that takes us to our lunch break so thank you very much for coming forward and we are now adjourned until 30 and oh sorry we 're June to 150 it 's New Zealand rugby not coming why wouldn 't we get them to come at 40 well it just seems to me that we 'll hit okay I mean yeah I just want us to finish the series became yeah okay so we 're a June to 140 _"

    "text": "oh dude do you want to do your submission yeah yeah sure so we 're not due to have our lunch great for another 20 minutes so it would be it would be fine so that 's some item a page number one two one on our agenda I 'm dr. Luce the submissions convener for spokes carefully thank you and I 'll let you know when to start the video thank you for staying attentive through the many hours days and weeks hearing from people who make up the Christchurch community I appreciate your patience and your diligence in making the hard decisions as to what may be a sustainable and satisfactory future for Christchurch in the worst light the LTP is a lolly scramble with ratepayers pockets emptying quickly one hopes that the mood at this scramble is a bit subdued living to a budget is a chore it is much easier to pretend that we can afford all we want yet rates Rises cannot be sustained roading infrastructure costs are high cycling infrastructure saves money by moving people out of cars reducing congestion and breaking the cycle reckon jest and demand evermore money space and lives or reducing community amenity Cranford Street is a current example of what we give up to drive and in the central government contribution for cycleways which also helps to rebuild infrastructure and would be imprudent not to accelerate building the major cycle routes and local cycle network please start the video this video questions what cycling skills are required views alternatives to infrastructure and what is to frequent experience of cycling when infrastructure is not fit for purpose and you need high-speed Internet if you would like I can provide a USB with this video on yeah I maybe so this is what staff do without cycle infrastructure people in Christchurch are forced to develop skills and courage so we don 't need to have cycle infrastructure but it probably won 't help to attract the 8 to 80 year old interested but concerned riders Wow let 's look summer this is why spokes consistent some apps for at least 2 meter wide cycle lanes and better enforcement and door buffer zones are not just a nice to have education promotion make the culture change required if interested but concerned writers are to have true much choice spokes appreciates a council support cycling infrastructure to avoid scenes like this one spokes makes the same request we 've been making for decades please prioritize cycling infrastructure build the major cycle routes and complete the local network as soon as possible doing so meets real transport needs pent-up demand results in long term savings and can save lives our written submission provides details spokes acknowledges that some people have to drive getting more of us on foot bikes and buses reduces the congestion allowing those who must drive to do so more easily spokes ask council to support a sustainable transport future to reiterate expand and accelerate delivery of all the major cycle routes and the local cycle network include funding for travel demand management education and promotion motivate the police to prior to ice enforcement make well-designed cycling infrastructure a standard part of all transport projects as it 's currently done with footpaths bring cycle infrastructure design in house while designating cycle champions on staff and reinstating an empowered cycle advisory panel it may be needed and that 's it questions I 'm Phil tnks I 'm going to ask you like you 've referred one thing you 've referred to is perhaps that the expertise should around cycling building shall be brought back in-house to counsel so currently as you know there 's like an alliance system we ran a number of exterior groups contract and do you have any comments to say like well it just seems to me that currently while we 're wanting to build and a good number of cycle ways we need a good number of cycle way engineers to so I 'm not sure where that fits with Queen we might bring the cycleway staff in-house well I think there 's a whole lot of structure that 's going to be built over the next 10 20 30 40 years which should be a long enough time span to warrant bringing people in-house and part of the reason we bring this up it 's not just the cost of using outside consultants but also I review all the projects that are put out for submission between those projects as to what standards are being applied some seem to be aware of the cycle design guidelines some are clearly not I think you 're losing a lot of institutional knowledge I think you 're not in being able to apply your own policies effectively because people don 't know there 's just so much communication that can occur I also think you desperately need to have a minimum especially if you 're going to be using outside consultants cycle champions within the council who can monitor these projects in fact all the projects to make sure that they are treating cycling the way it needs to be treated if we 're going to achieve the goals the city has set for itself and I think we need a cycle advisory panel to be set up because we need to do something to try and stem the min be pushback right now I think people are operating with a lot of ignorance I mean we can repeatedly hear people saying well cyclists don 't pay anything to use the roads and we can 't rely on the out a different message all together to be able to get that message out sorry and your points around education and promotion you refer to that high level for education for people or I 'm just wondering are you also including like besides safety for cyclists that the be education for drivers as well so that in fact we 've got cyclists pedestrians and motorists or actually sharing the road and I guess understanding each other is that what you actually absolutely absolutely things do okay _"

    "text": "do we have the Canterbury Rams here you Oh Caleb Caleb Harrison Canterbury Rams please come forward thank you thank you very much for having me and taking the time when I put the submission in there was some unknown things that I think we 've received a positive result so we 've been working hard with Baskerville New Zealand on bringing the tall blacks and to play a World Cup qualifying going to Christchurch on the 29th of November with the budget being approved for Metro the result of it I believe is that the scoreboard and the court that 's required for a FIBA level one game is going to be purchased state Gambling has been fantastic to work with the only unknown thing is win the floor and the school board is going to be purchased with the tall blacks game on the 29th of November Baskerville New Zealand will need to work with the equipment to make sure the equipment is up to speed so if there 's any way to expedite that pre-purchase of the school board from that Metro budget that would be really we 're trying to bring the New Zealand Breakers back to Christ you to play both preseason and regular season games with basketball booming we think it 's really unfortunate that there hasn 't been elite international bus will be played in Christchurch so our organization is doing anything we can to bring these games to the city and it just really comes down to whether we have a an agreement arena and a facility that 's up to speed for those kind of games New Zealand Breakers require a fever level one arena as well and the floors be purchased so the only thing that 's stopping being the breakers here as the scoreboard so anyway to give that scoreboard sign signed off and in the next couple of weeks would be really useful and trying to attempt to bring both the breakers here in September in October and still a little solidifying that tall blacks game here the 20 Movember but yeah really really positive news when I pop the submission forward I was unsure whether that budget was going to be approved it 's since been approved that the school board will be signed off and purchased within the coming weeks so yeah more words of encouragement and thank you very much for all the support the city gives basketball and trying to trying to bring it international basketball so our kids can see it and hopefully once one day is aspired to be tall blacks and tall firms thank you excellent any questions it 's gonna be a sure qualifier like predicting it because the qualifiers are in June so it 's unknown but it could be a country like Lebanon the really exciting thing is that the TV all of these qualifying games get broadcast in Asia so China is obviously the big big market if it is Lebanon that 's a that 's a good TV market so having a game here in Christchurch will be really good working with the council and how can we profile the city and how can we make more people in Asia aware that Christchurch is a destination city now and the big question on the specialty of record slips as in the chance Adams will be playing NBA season so we 're going to miss out there maybe there 's a possibility plays in the June window but Christchurch hasn 't got that the good thing about this is we 're going to potentially get one to two tall blacks games every year so when Steve does decide to play there 's a good chance that we 'll have them here in Christchurch which will be unbelievable Adam I just want to thank you guys because a pioneer we have that yet the the the primary schools play you 've got from DSR wanted a Saltine schools all together it 's really really cool so and this it 's going to be such a boost for them so thank you very much yeah thanks thank you very much have a good day boy am I Yanni 's got a question don 't think you 're getting a well flight me Nora wait just trying to understand so yeah and great and thanks really repeat what others say you know it 's been tested what you 're doing and really exciting when we get the scoreboard obviously horn but if it just goes to metro sport is that the best place for it or are people like Canterbury Rams is that where they basically gonna be playing once next row supports comes on board Metro will be the best place for the Kennedy Rams to play because of the capacity of 2500 to 3,000 is about what our market is right now the price tag on Horne Castle is far too expensive we 're taking one Rams going to Horn castle and it 's going to cost us 20,000 we 're really lucky because the Christchurch casino is under us in that game so we 've been able to do that this year but the Rams plans are to play at Metro the tall blacks games will need to be played at plan Castle though because the fever fever level one arena has to be at least 3,000 seats so it makes sense to play the tall blacks or the international games up on Castle and they don 't make sense for the Rams to play at Metro with maybe one or two games at Queen Castle a for our market I mean we 're trying to grow it hopefully we get to a point where basketball can attract 78,000 people in domestic level because the participation rates would indicate that 's the kind of demand that the participant participation rates are not quite yet matching the bums and seats so I think it 's just a matter of seeing these kids go from kids to lifelong participants of basketball and then they 'll become parents and then they 'll take their kids along to games so I think over time the demand for basketball is definitely increasing thank you right but thank you very much for your submission great good Cheers _"

    "text": "go cycle Christchurch Connie Christensen kilograms caleb Harrison are we a little bit ahead of time well I suggest that we know what are we going to do then because spokes honey welcome we 're a little but I heated up time which is why we ask people to come here least they think you well good morning still so my name is Connie Kristensen I 'm a psychic Christchurch go cycle Christchurch is an initiative helping new and returning adult cyclists and even though we 're the only help available for adults at the moment to know this escape the cycle of Irish we actually run cycle skill sessions and confidence rise without any funding from Council has pledged to be cabin neutral by 2030 I hear so Cossack the Christchurch is very disappointed and worried that the long term plan is showing the major cycle routes are being pushed into the future for completion we don 't really understand that because surely the cycling is part of the carbon-neutral plan so we are urging you that you actually go ahead with it especially when we are just starting group that is the interest that were concerned adults in the population these people will need the seperated cycle ways to be able to see themselves getting from A to B on a bike instead of continuing to driving their castes so the major cycle routes are crucial before actually continuing the trend that we are just starting to see which is very encouraging so yeah and it is also a thing that is necessary for all these people they have and if the adults can 't see so if the parents can 't see themselves cycling to or from work they won 't let their kids cycle to school either so the major cycle routes a crucial part of this in providing safer cycle routes the psycho way counters that have been installed along the cycle ways that are already built clearly show that when you build it people start to use it so again please please please get the remaining major cycle routes built faster rather than slower and then we 're here but these cycle ways that cost so much money and that 's what we hear cycle ways are actually going to save money in the long term when you look at the rate of return for cycle infrastructure in general and I think particularly things like the major cycle routes the rate of return is actually something like 7 at least and they might actually save the council up to 20 for every dollar that you invest here so if you 're looking for money for the future you invest in cycle infrastructure now rather than later and again if you delay this it 's a real shame to see what is actually been started there will be lost so the momentum is starting to be seen we just need to keep it going you can 't just let it happen on its own it won 't happen on its own it 'll take forever and you 'll lose the momentum so also the money that has already been invested will actually lose it 's worth so that 's another thing so if we put this into perspective again what I said this means that say if the council was to put a million dollars actually have at least 7 million available support in to public health community facilities public art resurfacing roads other things that could maybe achieve the carbon-neutral that you I have said a plan for for 2030 the fact is that investing in major cycle routes also mean local improvements to underground utilities which gets repaired and upgraded as part of building the cycle ways this is also the case with improved pedestrian crossings and sidewalks enabling even more safe journeys on foot and by bike so it 's not just for the people who choose or might be choosing to cycle it 's actually also to get more people out walking shorter distances we think go psycho crisis that the council could actually improve how they 're in for how they inform the community about these are disloyal improvements to get more people on board whatever this is you 're trying to achieve here for everyone and look in the city no matter whether you choose to cycle or not on a personal level when we work with go cycle Christchurch we have volunteers but it is amazing to see decades weaving beaming for joy from the sense of achievement when they rediscover the fun and freedom the peddling from A to B can give them it is really amazing and almost half of the journeys that we are doing on a daily basis apparently less than six kilometers or so which means that even new cyclists would be able to pedal most of those small journeys or shorter journeys to start with so the potential for pedaling in Christchurch is huge and especially with the flat environment that we have so thank you very much for listening and all the tim chance any questions you might have we have any time does anyone have any questions I think you 've made a powerful presentation or Yanni 's going to ask a question Thank You Yanni you 've talked about on the point to around Cranford Street and I 'm not sure how where you are of the other work so it 's not just Cranford straight there 's a number of other roads that are gonna be upgraded for motor vehicles and that area do you wanna just maybe becomes what part of it goes into a road to enable more people to actually travel by time to the CBD into the city center more use of the think of occupancy cars rather than actually putting some of it space in for enabling safer cycleways just putting a couple of lines on the side of a two-lane road where you have a lot of really heavy trucking going down and actually almost encouraging most more traffic than you are that will happen with the motorway going down we really don 't understand why that motorways been extended to Cranford Street rather than just ending a qe2 where the cars and trucks should really be going around town rather than through town so it 's just how the money is being spent we understand that you haven 't built the most way that previous government but to carry on for growing and encouraging that pointless projects we don 't just really don 't understand there when there there could be a lot of saving potentially in the long term budget and this is a long term budget you 're looking about two years ten plus years that you 're looking at what you 're spending of the money on and what it is that you 're trying to achieve because more cars it 's not going to get your PAP a neutral look thank you very much for your submission it 's um greatly appreciated thank you _"

management plain he talks about the history side update you mean yes yes yes I have plans kind of pulled away but you bit your your you 're comfortable with face and there 's been trialed patches of that tried at South Shore just as I was talking about before where they wetlands push it away the top of the rock walls and then they came in and did some planting with seagrass mostly seagrass and what it doesn 't do is a doesn 't stop this erosion that occurs with wave surging in storms we have a predominantly southeast wind there and it was hopeless it that the plants just all died and so it 's they 're not you know planning like gary has planned for this basket system that sets you know on the slope of the mend which counteracts the weight the surging of the waves and the erosion is also seed amount of problems you know that we 're getting a lot of sediment coming down the athan from storm water and things and i don 't think it deals with that sure the plants might clean the water in they 're good for water quality and that seems but sediment you know how plants are really going to deal was there that 's another basket simply raised it because it is another element and that whole process with regenerate Christchurch and the rezoning that 's occurred down there so I just wanted to make sure that you are familiar with it so we were in a position but I mean you 've you 've

    "text": "it will Center Manman football Megan McClay and Julian Barden thank you for coming welcome we would like to acknowledge that landscape regarding indoor facilities in Christchurch has changed since the submission was lodged Christchurch netball by an anonymous benefactor has been afforded the opportunity to develop a community multi-use sport stadium without two team and report spaces used by need more futsal and other sports the benefactor has indicated a willingness to make an investment of up to 15 million dollars to the project which is a significant investment in a fantastic opportunity this facility would complement the Metro sports facility through all the consultation around Metro one point that was constantly made is that even with Metro there is a significant shortage of multiple facilities in Christchurch and that there will remain a significant shortage of quality and will be news for all sports theatre facilities are not provided the solution would have our sports to provide more opportunities for Christchurch residents to be involved in active participation it supports the council mandate of more people more active more offer both organizations have worked collaboratively over a significant facility for community local news an erequest abortion assistance from the council to enable this opportunity to come to fruition within the next 12 to 18 months Nepal is the lab there 's a number one choice of team sport for females in the highest registered participation sport for females and New Zealand and Christchurch as effects largest Centre in New Zealand the presence of meatball in nearly every school in New Zealand with high participation rates from our embassy Suffolk Islanders makes the sport a significant contributor to the well-being physical and mental health about young people and their families those that all levels need to be able to experience pain conditions that are now being given the available other cities and centres Christchurch netball player numbers are considerably higher than those in Dunedin however deleting the call center is able to offer a wider variety of options to play including modified versions of the game which is reflected in most centers in New Zealand thus include programs such as seed approaching development and training opportunities all formats of the game open to be provided 7 regardless of weather programs and activities at club level walking netball and newly introduced initiative fast five people competitions each offense programs after-school Network activities and programs umpire trainings and professional development opportunities currently Christchurch does not have a facility that meet the requirements to hold tournaments which would in all likelihood be held at the metro sports facility while leaving a community-based facility available for uninterrupted community use the consequences for not having a community-based supports for sports court facility are the progress of Nepal in the city will continue to be hindered we are unable to provide Nepal in various forms of the game at various times of the day on various days of the week end and doors continual game cancellations compromise the experience enjoyment especially for a young players health and safety issues with some rapidly deteriorating external courts of heaven

such a large majority about players coaches and um class players will not maintain available to different flexibility around playing times it 's Meghan I 'm Jillian chief executive at mainland football so once again thank you for giving us some time to speak man on foot was one of seven Federation 's across the country and we look after football and futsal from each bedroom through to Nelson with 15,000 members playing football and over 5,000 futsal players foot totals of products being developed through FIFA it 's an internationally recognized game World Cup come and go every four years and for tools they 're doing football and New Zealand 's currently sitting in a bidding process for the 2020 foots a World Cup which Christchurch is one of the host cities that 's been being tagged if you think about futsal right now it 's one of the fastest-growing indoor sports in the country extremely popular in the youth segment which is key keeping our youth engaged give them fit and healthy the interesting thing with futsal it actually has a 65% mail thief I 've seen female sweat so it 's a sport that is attracting young females into the game so it 's cutting through some of those demographics the schools are a significant part of this the ability for us to collaborate with schools and run competitions is key to its success in Christchurch as I said we have over 5,000 players an increase of over 70% in the last two years from these numbers we simply believe is scope for growth and what we needed the facilities to to allow that to happen some examples I can give is in Dunedin Yuka centre with 24 courts where futsal is grand over a thousand teams and nine and half thousand place on a population basis for only hundred twenty eight thousand people the twin full court venue in Dunedin actually meets all of their requirements Wellington 's another market that 's very similar to us in terms of size and it 's supported by a 12 core 4-cylinder the ASB center and then some regional facilities with four to six courts that allows competition to be played all around Wellington they 've also managed to get seven and a half thousand players over the last two years as well is opportunities for growth not just in our sport but a number of indoor sports with the right number of or access the right number of venues around the city the biggest issue we do face with futsal and its continued growth as the ability to provide environments what we 're seeing this facility doing is actually adding further opportunities for us to run community festivals to run holiday programs and do that in collaboration with a number of other sports in the city they 're looking for indoor space and I back up what Megan said we certainly see this as complementing the metro facility so give some terms of what we 're looking for is Megan 's outlined ability to bring someone to the table it has a significant amount of money to invest we 're looking for support through council to support us in our efforts as individual sports but looking for assistance they would allow us to navigate our way through the legal requirements of getting a facility built and also looking for financial assistance in helping with the outfit of the new indoor stadium never dollars so with the 15 million coming from the benefactor some support from council and the two codes also investing through various funding mechanisms we believe this could be a very good outcome and positive outcome in a relatively short amount of time for the city questions okay it 's really asking for a gator from Council to help you through this process of establishing the facility someone that can kind of guide you through all the consumed thing all that sort of stuff yes yeah I think we when we meet with me obviously people from council and that came to help us through this process there has been some kisses been some locations that we 've seen that could work but we need to work through the paperwork in the background to say won 't concede to you in those types of things okay so they will be key Sara mark it 's not hi some we visited that so two or three years ago when this option came to us and it would have been changes to that facility to make it work and commercially it 's so that was I guess we put to the side at that time all right well look thank you very much for your submission that 's much appreciated Anchorage _"

    "text": "okay christchurch archery club Bell scuse my bill nice to see you I 've done archery at the Christchurch archery club that doesn 't conflict me though yeah bye I did one bullseye yep it didn 't take long for me to get a bull 's-eye_''_23.82 if people haven 't_''_27.09 if people haven 't done archery I just recommend it it 's a it 's a very interesting it 's actually takes a bit of a pull on your shoulder more than I realized anyway welcome the Christchurch Club is a world affiliated organization dating from 1948 we were told by council staff that the mainland management plan was being reviewed and if we needed to submit anything we need to do so before doing 18 this was incorrect because it was actually LTP that they were referring to we received further information from Council on the 5th of April that our submission needed to be any by the 30th of April so we had very little time to convene a committee meeting absurd mission effort has been rather hasty we were concerned that no reference to the development proposal changes to projects and Award segment document so the big picture what the LTP means for archery in row domain and the futures we work to find out about at lease what do the issues in the LTP mean for us water supply we commend the council initiatives in that regard flood risk in the event of a tsunami it would likely mean that our facility would be affected but the public and the users would be safer we accept that problem and will deal with we have to roading we acknowledge that the City Council is acting in the interests of all users and prioritizing critical matters circle routes do not affect us and while the cost of this work is high we notice that the council is utilizing governed provisions as best they can parks our occupancy at ref et demain is per curious as we are constantly bombarded with organizations wanting to use their shooting area so I think the fact they 're working in the wider interests of the city our lease expires in two years and then what happens in 2014 we had to develop the idea was that we would be able to start pay shooting facility for the whole of New Zealand because it would be indoors our lease expires in 2001 and we 've spoken to the redzone development wind of the council but any work on that arose likely would be 10 years away further it seems that the councillors weren 't concerned about the Louisville of native trees near us and they 're arguing and helping us move forward we have been a good tenant we were promised action I 'm still waiting the post facility was included in the future of TV the main plan we were told that we would not need resource consent and the domain plan was sufficient to enable us to progress and notify the public of our intentions now councillors requesting a full financial proposition before moving forward and considering our facilities we have raised in consists of a third of the cost already however we can 't give bureaucracy into action why is our proposal not flagged in the LTP is it because we have not asked for help with funding sports facilities smooth player and understanding the priorities required for that sport why are small sports ignored and marginalized we still provide a service for rec bears and particularly why would not even mention when we originally was seen as important for something in you bro why has the land that we used were made available to everyone on Sunday in summary why does the council decent policy allow everyone else safe space without reference to us across at a certain point cross-country bicycle event organization was told by the council that they could reverse our shooting visibly and when they approached us and realized they could not they were further taught by counsel that they weren 't allowed to use the ethics and rope athletics and ragini fee of grounds but could use our space even though the council knew we had an event on at that time they were told they could use their camera back again without for us so what do we use loyalty key funding document states on page 19 we need to make bitties their public spaces but I suggested the statement should include the following our existing users what we made aware the years see our facility proposal later in the piece and this is with the Tennis Club and then today I was told it 's going to be ten years before they hit them to noon write the dialogue with the counselors paw and puts the responsibility to notify us of their intent at the chip our use this doesn 't not always occur and remains unchecked communication needs to be improved castle relationship only controversial initiated discussion seems to bring us together instead of recognition what would provide to the city and that we are important to the city remember we 're all volunteers the Christchurch Eric club operates from a volunteer base reservist affordable rhetoric and coaching programs and the community sort of support outcomes thank you I 'm Sarah thank you for that I 'm just wondering if you 've we have a submission earlier today from a group promoting a new shooting in archery space and Christchurch have you had a talk to them at all or if you 're just very keen to stay where you are currently so everything really right we don 't okay one of the things that we have to be aware of is the Christchurch you club is the International Club that 's right and so anything we do has to take into account world archery that 's right thank you um any other questions Jonnie I was just wondering if there was a lot more detail and what he talked about rather than what 's on you rip submission now you have to provide that through to them actually I was gonna wind up with that comment because there was a lot more information then then in the or Britain then any of written submission so but I think that 's explained by the fact that you had a relatively short period of time to prepare your submission so if you could email that what you 've spoken to through to the staff that would be incredibly helpful for us okay it would be better if it sent as a document because we are trying to be paperless and it would be great okay thank you very much thank you right _"

    "text": "but peace free Banks Peninsula working group David Miller to the table please thank you good morning should we get started yes please sorry all right all like you 're on good morning again madam mayor and councillors thank you very much for the opportunity to be heard today I 'm David Miller and in this iteration I am before he was the chair of the pest-free Banks Peninsula and Port Hills partnership and I 'm submitting on behalf of the partnerships working group to give you some context Banks Peninsula Conservation Trust has initiated and chairs the pest-free Banks Peninsula and Port Hills working group that 's a growing consortium of key partners including Christchurch City Council he can dock the Summit Road society the rock normal exponential a trust Conqueror Tata Runanga banks peninsula Conservation Trust of course and others our collaboration with key partners is comprised of key players who have demonstrated their commitment to a pest-free Banks Peninsula and Port Hills it 's a community driven approach with strong and enthusiastic agency support membership of this partnership will also include Selman District Council and is open the pest-free Banks Peninsula and Port Hills working group welcomes the focus on implementation of a pest management the City Council 's long-term plan for 2018 to trade late in their service plan for parks and Warshaw we similarly welcome the service intention to implement a restoration program for threatened indigenous ecosystems and integrated conservation of threatened species in the service plan and we see mister controls integral to all this so I 'm here to ask specifically or to encourage Christchurch City Council to implement the following first a long term commitment to supporting a community driven partnership approach to all pest control work on Banks Peninsula realized through the partnership that partnership is described in our MOU which will be formally signed in September this year you may have a copy of the MOU attached to our written submission secondly we 're looking for financial support of a minimum of 50,000 in year one of the partnership to develop an overarching strategy for a pest-free Banks Peninsula and a multi-agency and organizational collaborative operational work program thirdly we 're hoping for a commitment to all Christchurch City Council with history of exponential and foothills partnership overarching strategy and work program we also request an annual provision of 40,000 cash and in-kind support for continued implementation of the ongoing goat eradication Banks Peninsula and a scaling up of the dissemination of animal pest traps and training events on their appropriate use to support ground-based community efforts for pest control and the development of local capacity for example as with the accurate trapping group the Summit Road society and the quail Island restoration trust but also like to mention trap libraries which are in our experience enthusiastically responded to and supported by the communities in which they are available there 's an excellent example in the akuti Valley and we need more such libraries so that the community can pursue its own initiatives in support of the overarching strategy we 've designed so thank you for hearing me thus far I won 't repeat what I 've put in the wider written submission and I 'd be grateful for any questions or comments you may have thanks David does anyone have any question so Phil thank you David I 'm an indication of the result so far with the pest free programs in terms of the no the increase in in the native though for now we have patchy information on that and that 's one of the reasons that we 're putting monitoring and scientifically based data collection and reporting back as one of the key pillars of the overarching strategy that we 're developing it 's we always say you know the the measure of our success is bird song but also a measure of our success is the demonstrable reduction and numbers of low-hanging it 's a pest control such as feral goats yeah even cats and so we need that we need to become far more sensible about the true impact of what we 're doing but the feral goats strategy is is it 's been working very recently in little Alcala and we 're hopeful that with the full eradication of goats from that part of the peninsula for example we will have cleared over half of backs miniature of feral goats and hopefully we 'll see a regeneration floor biodiversity great thank you cuz some needs to be further measurement other successes oh yes increases Thank You resourcing to make sure that we get a step-up increase in drew thank you I 'm David you mentioned um trap libraries is an opportunity for the communities are getting involved in pest eradication would you be looking for council funding for traps or is is funding likely to be available from elsewhere but if counsel were able to provide space and maybe some facilitation to our existing networks for tract libraries you answered the question Andrew thank you yes so we 're we 're not seeking funding specifically for that at this stage but we are aware that there 's a tremendous community and growing community interest in supporting biodiversity activities so there is a ongoing demand not only for traps but for education about traps and for education about appropriate monitoring and feeding back it was a recent open day at the akuti trap library it was astonishing to see the whole community participating mm-hmm experience okay any additional questions Aaron asked for a goat last time this came up but he 's already put whole concept and the the MOU process and everything or something that 's you know it 's exactly what we 've been looking for in the LTP so thank you very much _"

    "text": "right Canterbury trailer Yacht Squadron John Collins good morning I have with me Willie Newman who 's a member of a committee and who 's been shredded yachts and longer than I have but we 're really grateful to have this opportunity to tell the council how important the facilities at naval point are for the health of your squadron it is the only deep water access area in Greater Christchurch if you want to launch and so the trailer yacht and do not use no the point the nearest places where you can build either a pigeon very now I know the Nova Point club has put in a big solution we 've read it and we 're very happy with the submission and fully supported as a Dean we support the proposed allocation of firms to make a point one of the influences for trading yachting was that it was a design that could accommodate mother father and the children can go sailing together after the 2000 school that really ripped most of marine or other facilities and the earthquake there was a drop-off of membership and particularly have seen an increase in the number of peers the children the problem basically was Littleton at the my mother 's particularly in regards to launching in some early conditions the launch read has become unusable and we can 't sail and an interesting phenomena would weather changing is that we record every time we sail the wind directions and what has happened lately is there the son has taken over a lot of easterly winds and of course it 's the sub early that causes troubled another thing that 's very important to the squadron is to head in the area where we can store our yacht some of the bigger trailer yachts could take anything up to two hours to lower the mast and get the roadworthy to tow away in my case I love our topic Clifton Hill and you 're going to made you tried to drink a six point two you 're at Clifton Hill let alone find some way to market now the treadeth travel squadron seventies just organization national meetings we actually account for nearly half my hair there 's an image but weird events such as the Sydney home at Grayson the America 's Cup the idea to be involved with you 've got a very deep no just basically it 's a maker giving I mean listening to the two submission a couple of the submissions before about the big new hall we just wanted we bit of this money developed over a naval point to develop Christchurch 's voting area at the moment compared to anywhere else in New Zealand at some embarrassment to put it mildly the Marine and the 1700 birds per head of population compared to any other place they 're going to get about 300 the launching facilities just diabolical and there 's no facilities for showers there are some toilets over there so it is somewhere that needs to be developed long term so we bit of the money would over the hill place the new Marino Avenal heart has shown that there are people in Christchurch you would rather heavily votes here and that 's been a success for any small thank you Andrew it then Yanni thank you thanks for the submission and are and some of the current failings given that we 've got ten million dollars or there abouts on budget in the current plan for delivery of the navel point development plan or the first stage of a navel point development plan and that would deliver that first phase of what would be a larger plan intended to be delivered over a far longer period what do you think of the immediate priorities for naval point if they were you know two or three or four things that we were going to particularly focus on what do you think the most urgent things are them but the highest priorities would be it 's not about sailing in assembly that 's fine it 's actually getting the boat out and getting the boat back in again and that goes for your wind surfers you do he 's your anybody anyone involved and playing on the water and a boat so the suddenly is just destroying this Yanni thank you I was just interested there 's obviously been a long history with a marina development in this area I 'm just trying port isn 't more involved in what you 're talking about has there been a reason I think because historically the port was the one that actually was going to provide the facilities and I 've just built a new new facility and you 're saying that we need more yeah the port 30 years ago when I 35 years ago when I first started trailer sailing we had an inner harbor launching facility mix to start brothers somewhere in somebody 's wisdom they came along and decided that a pipeline going over here was more important than getting a trailer yacht out of the water so consequently now we actually can 't bring your boat out with the master because the pipeline stops it so there 's no parking facilities over there in the Inner Harbor which was protected in a southerly so that 's realistically yes we 've tried talking that it 's this is a business model we 're looking at a recreational use model and under two of them don 't seem to be peering up Newport 's marina not for trailer yachts or anything in thank you we 've got smaller yachts you 've got potential possibly expensive trying to weave their way in amongst commercial shipping it just doesn 't work the other thing that horses the to the company the marina that 's fired is it 's nobody look at Thank You pulling you saying that the southern leaves are taking out of the easterlies usually increasing in the east yes and the trouble with these it 's a little more unpredictable you look at the forecast and think that 's not going to work for two hours in all of a sudden you 're out the middle and look over at give you space and there are back tears and some of these about two right if there 's been one incidents in the last year fortunately everybody was on the side so we all just have to go into the other hand away for the South thank you thank you very much for your submission that 's much appreciated thank you okay excuse me excuse me excuse me can we just jump I would like us to a June now for for our next submission thank you _"

    "text": "Canterbury sports shooting complex Marc Featherstone good morning and welcome good morning yeah thank you very much for seeing us my name is Marc Featherstone and this is England you know we 've received the Canterbury 's for cheating now trusts so they 'd like to talk to you on two topics one is safety another one is a range of sports that don 't get a huge amount of mention throughout New Zealand so basically in New Zealand I have a presentation up here I 'll page down yeah so in New Zealand New Zealand is over quarter per million people with for our holding forums licenses in the Canterbury region this over 35,000 that is you hold firearms licenses and this is increasing on average around about 1300 new firearms licenses a year you know the clubs that we have in crisis in camry SE only care for 1400 so the questioners as weird as everybody else go and that 's the problem we 're facing today so to give you a permanent casein weeded out the students are going and this is the big issue why miss thought it was a delayed inflate actually basically ideally we want hauless everybody with the farm to go to a place where they can you know practice these shooting sports in safety but because of the clubs that we do have the limited amounts we 're struggling to keep our okay nice you can see here it 's pretty dangerous flat far mean even if people are shooting on their own private property some of these firearms when you do pull it trigger that projectile for misses its target can go up to eight and a half kilometers if it 's a larger caliber which is pretty scary okay so why aren 't people are tending the clubs okay the most of the shooting clubs right on the planes island in a small area that we do here we have handle owners association we have the deerstalkers christchurch pistol club and Cantabria outdoor target shooters at these clubs here again it 's a stage where they 're getting pretty full they 've also run by volunteers as well and the days that they are open are very limited for example a tuesday night they have four bays if guys go there to sign in their rifles they could be taking fifteen to twenty minutes per person decide on a rifle you 've got four ways as you can get it 's going to take a long time so that turns people off the deer stalkers they have an open day once a month rumble only volunteers do you Detroit person roping day you will see the lines of people via Christchurch pistol club which are she prob as well we had an open day on the Sunday just gone we had a small group of 30 people wanting to come learn how to shoot pistols l club is doubled in size as you come in place a tripling in size over the last three years and it 's a club where she 's struggling Decatur also as well the club 's themselves can only cater for a certain amount of bombs shooting sports there 's a lot of others that aren 't came forth one of the main ones is their thousand meter shooting a lot of hunters in sport long science it 's a real art to it the range is we never make planes all and and it go to a hundred and if you slipped and few can shoot up to 200 meters she quite missing out 800 so where does everybody go well to go anywhere they literally have to travel hours to get to a place where they can actually shoot which is usually in the middle of nowhere and even then you know most of Thomasson safe spots but we do have a lot of people walking traps and tramping lately so we do need to provide a spot three go multigo this is one of the fastest growing shooting sports in the world this is where you use three firearms together the only designing one place in New Zealand we can actually fully practice the sport and that is actually a road right without have Rangers there certain forum in Canberra sorry the South one we don 't really have anywhere we can practice it in Christ foods we have to practice with different types of caliber firearms so it 's like be a ping pong bat you know when you go to play the competition 's yeah it 's real hard so we 're pretty stuck or it gets very difficult so what could the solution be okay basically can it be sports shooting complex that 's the answer or to help with the problem that 's not a faller hammerstein answer but it will take a lot of the pressure off and say what we want to do is open world class facilities here in Canterbury okay there 's nothing getting you somewhere they can cater for this for everything we 've written we have solution there to give an example where is our land option this is the biggest thing we face we 've been researching over the last two years or three years forward plots of land that we can achieve build this complex it 's not just a matter of just hey here 's a paddock let 's build a shooting range we have to take on a wide range of things into consideration surrounding environments safety templates obviously shooting noises it 's a bit of an issue is everybody else and we also need to future-proof it as well so we put a lot a lot of thought into it we did have another plot of land that was available next to the West Melton military range but the the Eric carrier Club there they 've increased in size there so flight times and that was gonna be a bit of all in just six mission so this last piece of land that we have found the settlement claims island it 's nice they can replay target club and it 's xu and he can land it 's a good thing but basically he can land what that means is it can 't_''_430.3 be built around so if we do put if we are able to put a complex there with future proofing it and that 's one of the key things here as well so houses won 't get too close so from the ranks their nearest house would be about 1.2 kilometres away we 're working on with them acoustic seams in ears at the moment to really come and contain as much noise as well was also nice and close we 've done surveys amongst members on that and we found pretty much everybody would like to stick with and a half from Christchurch but we this is between half an hour an hour for prizes for most shooters it 's only a small amount that will want to travel over an hour of the public so we do this something that is close but then also we don 't want to get too close to Christchurch as well for thinking of the future here so what will the complex cater for basically these are just some of the shooting sports we wish to cater for this is once they do see the clubs at the moment can 't cater for what is obviously thousand meters waffle shooting sporting play is another one we have a few clay clubs but sporting clays a different one it 's a bit of like playing a golf with the shotgun you kind of run a course there the club that we do heaven ken Murray they have to travel two and a half hours with all their it up and take it all away home free go multigo no explain before archery and crossbow do you say they practice that at the moment out it 's a New Brighton but there 's a lot of other places where they 've rented shoes beer once again noise encroaching and clubs around there and plus it 's in the mall in public they need a safe good safe environments subtle we target shooting can 't practice here because we haven 't got the grounds for up parallel picked shooting Paralympic personal club at the moment they operate out of a school hall so they turn up with their volunteers set up the range do the a 'practice scene pick it all up then have to go they can 't pay for any of the national or competitions because they haven 't got the places for us so they 're real keen also as well we want to have a big educational center everybody 's getting these forums licenses but one of the biggest things is is hey once you 've got your licence you don 't use it you they fully understand what it means to hold a firearms license what a means they cheat own a fire around really drumming into them we 've noticed through the years and they 're people coming through mm-hm okay hey we 've got to really put a lot of time and effort into these people and this is we 're struggling this clubs were unable to do that because of the facilities because we 're overloaded for example Christchurch personal club now module say we 're a medium-sized business and that 's what we 're pretty much having to turn around where she have an unemployed full time staff to get it going but once again we can 't cater for all it does shooting disciplines that people want to own practice so it 's a bit of an idea a few of them yeah so it 's a crossing everything to do is shooting disabled our tree crossbow long distance multi gun shotgun all in a safe environment education is a big thing our members want education okay that 's one thing we have found we put you know emails people applying we 've actually had two works that one course and make it turn into five five groups coming through we 've been running their tests on a small course at the club over the last five months or so as well we want to encourage big convoy diversity these shooters hunters yes we go out and we shoot peace okay didn 't use them but we also do love nature okay we want to see museum and Flora 's naturally we want to get rid of the rats and the possums and the deer and the Wallabies and the wall picks it destroying our vegetation and destroying our landscape so we 're into a big time so this one thing within the complex area as well because there 's a lot of land there can 't_''_689.87 be used we want to turn it back to its natural biodiversity and also encourage we see here quite a few hunters that if you do bird breeding waterfowl breeding as well encourage nature back into the environment I 'm just concerned that would come to the ten minutes so okay sorry 's that okay so they ask is basically what we 're after as we after from active support from the Christchurch City Council an endorsement of the concepts yeah we 're looking at selling district leads from now moving as Christchurch City Council and so any support here moving forward in hidden and right very simply greatly appreciated so he came leaned so until you 're not asking for a specific item on terms of the LTP you 're asking for some support from council staff in order to progress the concept before it goes any fear that friend yep okay right lovely thank you very much for your submission thank you great thank you _"

    "text": "can I have the Nathan Godfrey Canterbury Rugby Football Union good morning it faraway kya Kehna me Rugby Football Union supports the crusher City Council prioritizing a new stadium and your long-term plan crushers leads the world in very few pursuits but undoubtedly undoubtedly one of those as rugby the game is in the city 's DNA as a reagent cannery produces world-class rugby players and championship winning teams we certainly acknowledge that there had been other competing priorities but as this process begins in earnest we are simply asking for a seat at the table we were buoyed by the Crown 's decision to fast-track a business case and we applaud the collaborative approach to the crown and Council are taking and working with all the major stakeholders and sporting codes the Cafu vision is to unify and serve our community we foresee a stadium that can be used for all black Test matches for doubleheader games featuring our men 's and women 's championship winning representative teams for national sevens tournaments for traditional midweek into school first 15 games for club rugby finals and as technology advances we of virtual rugby I 'm joined today by Sam dairy and grace Rooker who will share their thoughts on what a new stadium would mean to them Sam is Kepler the Cross published first 15 a school prefect and a member of both Henry under a 10 team and Crusaders Knights Academy program grace was a member of the Canterbury senior team that won the fire upon the cup national championship for the first time in 2017 she is a current member of the New Zealand under-18 sevens team and recently signed a black ferns professional contract growing up I 've watched games of rugby in concerts at the Dunedin Stadium and the atmosphere and vibe are always amazing I love the opportunity of being able to watch running rugby and the men of the weather with lots of points being scored and low I also loved seeing each year in live in action and hearing the screams of thousands of fans echo through this ad I hope that one day mates and I can enjoy these same experiences in Christchurch for the last two years I 've also had verse cottage boys high school game last year we won the match for the first time in 16 years the crowd was jammed into one small grandstand and scattered along the sidelines and although the atmosphere wasn 't teens I often think about what it would be like to play in front of a large crowd of both students and all boys my long-term dream is to play for the All Blacks and I hope that one day I can run out in the black jersey onto the new Christchurch Stadium my home ground with my family in the stands watching I grew up playing rugby in the country and was often the only girl in the whole competition I always got told that you won 't make it but that 's just made me more determined last year the can be rugby seenu 's women 's team played to can raise razor games at am I saying the experience was dampened when we had to warm up in the carpark and use a bigger hammer Edington for the changing room as the stadium could not provide one we won which was a big confidence boost and I recently signed a professional contract with the black fins which is a dream come true when I received the contact I musta read it over 500 times and then it finally sunk in I started I called my parents and both started crying I feel like women 's rugby is up and coming and I hope to get a new stadium in Christchurch so that we can showcase athleticism and rugby skills last week the CRF you contributed to a column in the metropolitan magazine about our thoughts on the stadium and we chose to talk about well-being economics we did this to illustrate the significant role the sport plays in the community not just rugby the sport and the development of our values and character and in defining who we are and how we live our lives the power of sport is measured in the hearts and minds of the teenagers sitting beside me to take sport for granted is to neglect the next generation we appreciate the sport is not for everyone but there is no denying the civilian contribution in Ellington was a beacon of hope helping rugby overcome the threat to our teams and our players and the wider community ironically the solution to this risk has now given birth to a far greater risk The Temper stadiums without doubt our greatest risk demonstrated by the number of high-profile sports entertainment events we have lost as a city I think the one thing that we can all agree on is that the new multi-purpose stadium needs to be affordable to build but it also needs to be affordable to operate for the next 50 years this could include structuring higher tunes based on a clean stadium model allowing the tenants to make their commercial obligations to sponsors and fans it could also include input around how the stadium functions our commercial marketing and events team possess the expertise to work alongside key stakeholders to help shape a fit for purpose Stadium for example contemporary hospitality products digital technology assets fan friendly activation spaces and a capacity that is scalable for both high volume and low volume events these are just some of the considerations that need to start to a warm summer evening in the year 2022 the sold-out stand signs are in front of a new Chrysler stadium our city is buzzing with anticipation ready to write another chapter in our proud history we will celebrate a Crusaders victory and we 'll celebrate brave leadership and bold ambitions of people in this room today thank you thank you we 've got any questions Vicki I 'm one of the concerns that 's come through from people who don 't want the stadium to be brought forward has been the cost of it are you guys expecting to make any fun and we just heard from hockey and how much they 're paying for their turf sand and seeking support from the council where are you expecting to make any financial contribution to the stadium as I said I think you greatest contribution is in our in our expertise our ability to help shape their business case and what they 're saying eventually looks like and maybe a Christian you want to put forward to the Crusaders as well but at this stage I 'm sure this stage stadium isn 't sustainable and I think I hinted that Devon our written submission so temporary stadium right now is our greatest risk to write B Thank You Nathan and just with that in mind I just wondered if you might talk with the National Museum reunion around the question my question though is when you 've also referred to the risk of the a my stay and I guess and how the future costs a that will be involved if multi-use arena doesn 't go here could you would you like to discuss that with us please experience we 've done a piece of work around and it 's not sustainable so around 107 percent of our ticket revenue is used on Mitch on paying for this they didn 't actually open the gates 117 is not sustainable and do you have any any figure on the future cost say if if it needed to be maintained further because I know there 'll be a building time yes probably more question for you stay in trust okay no chipping up yeah at Yanni I 'm thinking and thinking yeah powerful to hear the submissions from the young people say thanks um I 'm just trying to understand if the current temporary stadium which is a lot cheaper to operate than a permanent stadium I presume how does a bigger stadium with more flesh fit out and and you know it cost it that 's cost us Kepley a lot more but also operation may be bigger how does that make it more sustainable for you a grass fuel and you know 30,000 seats in a roof is this just the shell we 're talking about the model so for example Eden Park operates with the Ottoman rugby union and and the model is around reef share so 15% of every person 's ticket when they walk in the gate goes back to the state it 's a conversation that we 're starting to have with the corrosive standing trust but that makes it more sustainable with a fixed fee model the one point two three million dollars that Rodney pays at the moment to the stadium in my view is not sustainable in question so that it 's just 's other considerations as well around I asked be able to extract yield from having good hospitality spaces that are flexible from digital signage assets everyone 's using the for sidebar as a as a benchmark but they have a lot of static signage they don 't the ability to be able to activate within the bowl of the stadium so there 's other considerations that we need to start talking about right I mean just just at a high level it seems the future of professional sports and New Zealand seems of concern attendances seem to be declining the costs player salary soon to be going up and we 're seem to be asked as a city to contribute more and more rate payers money into bidding with other cities around New Zealand which obviously that spoils up the cost for us so yeah I 'm just really interested in how we get how we look at a sustainable model going forward and TV rights I guess are in New Zealand pretty limited because of our population compared to say overseas here they are I think you 're talking I 'm trying to shoot today the CR fu is a really complex business and there 's other opportunities for a lot of other events I think that the sheer volume thing my answer the sustainability wish opportunity of the first 15 games and in national sickness tournaments played with this day and that that certainly helps our business model okay thank you very much well two minutes I mean the trouble was is that we if we go over time we just have less time for others so I 'll make sure you 're the first question that you can ask to the grid Saders okay will the I 'm happy that you submit it afterwards but thank you very much for coming on Nathan that 's good to see you and great that the young people came as well Ben T Stokes and congratulations again to you _"

    "text": "have Canterbury hockey broad Templeton please good morning good morning this morning unfortunately rod is not one of us sitting at the table here today he 's away overseas my name is Mack Benson I 'm the chairman of hockey Hawks commonly was cast in to evolve capable of X Plex Takaki player and current we hope was it this morning the City Council has a long and very significant relationship with candidly hockey in the 1960s the majority of hockey was played on the council owned and managed Polo Grounds now more commonly known as South Hadley pack since those days the council has played an integral part and allowing hockey to evolve into the popular sport it is today two key examples of the development involvement with hockey from the council were the development pilot park in the 1970s which included building one of the first artificial surfaces in New Zealand and then following the earthquake sequence in 2010-2011 the plant support the council provided to build the new playing services at gnomic Park which enabled us to continue to deliver again those actions by the council have future community whole participation in hockey all levels and I 'm able to say that hockey is growing but a Twitter let continue growth is the increasing costs to the players category hockey is now very enthusiastic in fact excited I dare to say about being part of the new Sports Hub at my opponent away we believe for sharing of resources is becoming increasingly necessary for the survival of many community-based organizations and we as hockey therefore see this as a great opportunity to take a lead role in the community by demonstrating to Christchurch the benefits of a hub model an absolute priority for CH a however in order to to grow further is to be able to host international tournaments and therefore priority is the planning funding and construction of a third tube at that put away so if we certainly look forward to further than the very important relationships we had with what the council and look forward to those times I won 't hand over to Peter who 's going to speak the financing in in the twos thank you good morning customers establish justice the council 's funding assistance for artificial rocketeers over that time the council 's provided approximately two million dollars towards hockey tyr 's coasters provided three million dollars towards the new arena motives and considerably more were none we paired now facilities priorities in the foreseeable future that to get the new to happen or operational didn 't look towards the third to but also replacing the three to none we park that are coming to the end of their useful life while we 've enjoyed an excellent relationship with the councillor funding assistance today this has been on a case by case basis however tooth 's require a long term investment and we would like to develop a more strategic relationship with the council on care funding and continuing with the previous practice of inclusion for some provision for tests and the council 's long-term plan I 've been involved in hockey right from when I was a little kid playing a hickory park on the grass right through Club and through national win on the international stage and I 've now got two little children running around the there 's a very good heart at the moment especially since the Black Sticks did so well just recently at the Commonwealth Games we won a couple of medals in our Kennedy base representative teams always perform really well in the national stage the completion of the new tips and their pony ways is really exciting for us as a as a community sport it will give us much-needed space to develop our players and give them a better surface to play on and deliver bit of hockey experiences to the whole hockey community we currently attract our participation from a large and growing sector of our community including both males and females across all the ages and all year round demographics showing players as young as four year old fun stick try number two from the frosty said they morning to eighty plus year old to play masters throughout the summer currently all our turfs are fully booked throughout the winter and our game slots for all our age groups are at a maximum we have a range of conversations for all ages and all abilities in all the on the terrace most of our clubs and schools also train on the turf throughout Christchurch and in the nearby urban areas a couple of quick stats for you we play 221 games of hockey on our to FC twig and during the during the week our turfs are booked solid from 4 p.m. till 9 p.m. on every night and during the weekends all our competitions run on the tips from 8 o 'clock in the morning through to 30 on with said day on Sundays Mad Men can quickly the cost of playing and Everett 's Club subscription for our season for a normal person is approximately four hundred and thirty dollars a year which is a pretty big check compared to most other sports and our quarters are can be cockiest as to ensure that we 're fully inclusive and enable if I 'm the opportunity to play and the reality is that Jeter cost this isn 't always possible the other chefs are both fantastic for our kids and our grown-ups to play on and they 're critical to develop hockey is a community sport going oh he 's sure yes thank you very much for the support over many decades to this point from the council we can 't emphasize that enough we wish to confirm our desire to have a sustainable model going forward with council that we can actually do our planning and make it a really robust sustainable model and its kind of leader to reducing planning costs to make accessible community there 's a key issue thank you very much thank you very much Yanni thank you for taking the time to come in and for the work that you 've been doing I just remember people making quite a few submissions around the law support park and the shift of the sporting fields to the west of the city and to the north so I just wondered if you 'd done any thinking or planning around putting some surfaces and the sort of eastern suburbs and and if so what that was looking like or if not why not the discussions around to the east so thank you very much for your submission so currently in terms of the funding contract and so are you really asking for that to be long term and so how that 's in a period of time would you like that agreement for a ten-year grant to help us develop years ago and since then we 've had to lump sums to hell build the YouTube set hungry pack and this is where we think would be better they have a long term relationship so we can work out an animal figure or a structured payment program that we so we both know where we stand because we 've got three to four placements coming up and a half dollars for six years and so when you were established and of course you had you had that funding relationship with Council on a longer term basis are you thinking okay Oh Jimmy kind of formalize the financial partnership with the council my understanding now prune away a moment is not only love for the hockey Buffalo Creek is athletic etc so you formalize these financial partnership how to make that happen you are alone to kind of sign an MoU with the council for issue in the next week but we 're playing hockey and a lot more locations are just now feet away that we have the capital costs to manage we 've spent three and a half million dollars that none week park since the earthquake so which million came from the council we still have to replace those two contributions to some other smaller tips and tail just to help create capacity but not just enough Peter why Conners good luck thank you very much and thank you for your submission and for what you do for hockey and in Christchurch thank you very much _"

    "text": "and the first one is the action bicycle club Kim Chang welcome good morning morning so before I get into my submission regarding cycling in general that 's the subject that I wish to speak about I 've made some other details commenting on the financing on some of the facilities mainly I believe we should have all those facilities but as with the metro facility sports stadium I 'm sure you can find ways to save cost for for everyone involved so just very briefly I think completing the major cycle routes as well as continuing of the local cycleway program sooner rather than later will be more cost effective and will be much more benefits over the long run rather than extending those projects out for the next ten years it 's I think it 's really important to leave for New Zealand in this matter and because there is much at stake not just here but globally as well so and the third point is in the level of service you 've indicated in the long term plan for transportation I believe there can be more ambitious is the cycleway routes on the Smart View for last week and you can see that well over almost 100,000 trips in the week and approximately maybe 8,000 return trips per day so cycling is truly alive and well in Christchurch and this number can only get better when all the other cycle ways and connecting routes have been completed the LTP says that 206 million of that will be spent on the cycle ways to create over 100 kilometres of cycle way and I believe that fifty or sixty six percent of it will be refunded by the central government as well as NZTA so that means City Council would spend sixty eight million dollars from their own pockets and that works out to be about seven hundred thousand per kilometer and that is rather than the 2.1 million kilometer cycle way and you can get back hundred thirty-seven million which could go into other into your into other expenditure a part of that expenditure that has been spent on the cycle wave one and twenty six about twenty-six percent of it has gone into intersection upgrades drainage and cycle way but in general spending on updating the city 's transportation infrastructure the cycle way expenditure will fulfill all the new key objectives of the new GPS on land transport safety for the people who need it most on the streets accesibility value for money you won 't find a project per site for building road infrastructure that 's as cost-effective as this one and I 've caused an environment I managed to get some data as well and so the cycling uptick in since you created the cycle waves have been 40 percent higher than projected models and that 's been a 17 percent increase in uptake over the last quarter in 2017 so very optimistic figures for people getting on their bikes in Christchurch and this is the foundation for creating the accessible city by authoring a safe and convenient alternative to automobile use a lot of the private vehicle you have to get registration law if the private vehicle usage in Christchurch is really quite frivolous it 's something people take from a kilometer go down to the supermarket and then carry heaps of plastic bags trips around three to five kilometers estimated in NZ key research and we cannot continue to condone or promote this behavior or common date such behavior if you would like to meet real livable city goes in the city I noticed that quite a few level of service has been cut from the long term plan 2018 to 2028 and already in the figures provider for the service of transportation we are exceeding the projections as stated in this long-term plan Joff long-term plan so I hope that this particular section will be more ambitious of course having having more people uptake and choosing the cycling as a means of transport will also help regenerate the city because all these spaces that are being used for cars can be turned to land that it 's much more valuable smaller businesses can come in and you know just so much land in the central city can be useful for something else we also hope the City Council would play a more active part in participating in the events surrounding cycling for example that 's upcoming October and then the by Expo I 'm sure you 've heard a lot of good things about cycling but I like to point out something I think a bit more worrying trends in the country not just in Christchurch you have be doing the count Mexico in it but actually when you measured by the OECD New Zealand is the most obese cont overweight country in the world I mean 66% of New Zealand or to two hours three people might be overweight in this country and you know that 's costing a lot of money in terms of lost productivity social economics leaders health care costs a community infrastructure transport cost it does cost more to drive your car if you 're heavier and the cost excludes many intangibles grief from people who who live short lives and families and so on so it 's a lot there 's a lot going on here that it 's not being spoken spoken about the Ministry of Health defines active transport as active activity at least thirty minutes of brisk walking or about ten minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity five days a week and cycling cycling was also a level of service that 's been cut out on the long term plan I believe it 's the reinstating psycho state education program correct me if I 'm wrong but maybe you should look into reinstating this for the next ten years because one sip of the children here overweight and almost 10 of them are obese so it 's very important to provide this safe cycle infrastructure for them to be able to get physical exercise Christchurch is also the biggest polluter in New Zealand per capita 60 percent of which is from transportation because 50 percent of all the trips can be is really suitable for active modes of transportation instead of driving so this is again a statistic form and ends at Ta and that says almost you can save almost a million tons of co2 a year just by cutting out on you know chips that really don 't need a person to just drive down the block to get a pint of milk or something and of course that 's the a pollution cost that 's not being affected in as well 've got in this figures and more or less the figures for the nation and then just divide it per the population of Christchurch but you 're looking at millions of dollars in terms of social costs and health costs from a lifestyle promoting driving so I just wanted to say like it 's very important for the cycleways to be building you can say all you want about like electric cars or autonomous vehicles and that 's fine but if Christchurch can 't_''_542.42 be the city to do cycling well there 's no other city in New Zealand that can can do it you 've got that city you 've got not two spaced out the weather 's is nice even though today is a bit drizzly it 's not always like this electric bikes are being adopted in New Zealand in record numbers there 's going to be bike sharing possibly in the near future as well so having the infrastructure quicker accelerates the uptick of commuter cycling and personally I mean in our business we deal with people all the time who want to cycle many people help them gain the confidence it 's how to export your own city and in ways they 've never done before and so every day I have people who are really grateful for the cycleways really grateful that you know they can get from place to place without without too much fear and have a really high level of comfort in the commuter experience so please consider keeping not not cutting the budget on the side always and build them as as quickly as possible so thank you very much I think you must have time that the virtually the last second for your contribution to the long term plan but thank you very much I love the cartoon I presume that we 're able to download the actual presentation onto the hub very very helpful submission thank you very much thank you _"

    "text": "okay Lori Jones good evening good evening everybody I 'm a little bit new to this but I 'd really like to say thank you very much for taking the time out of your evening so now you have families and I really appreciate being here I 'd like to read that all right what Sam said I love ins mappings in South Christchurch and I 've found that by far the quickest way for me to get to my flights as to cycle on on a normal bike it can take me 45 minutes to get from home we 'll just change our bikes for electric bike so I 'm getting from home to the airport and my records 20 23 minutes Wow which you can 't do in a car and it 's a beautiful ride until you get to Memorial laughs because yeah you 're crossing through you come through our wonderful new city that has been developed and then you get into heavy Park and you scoot through eglee Park and then your straight line down Memorial F and when I talk to my friends more wonders of cycling to the airport it makes a big difference but the reason I 'm here tonight is that I would like to commend the council for a lot of the work they 're doing I am self-employed I 95 percent of my customers and the northern hemisphere my parents and I I grew up in Auckland my parents Olivia that loved me to live in Auckland but I live in Christchurch because I love living in Christchurch in one of the reasons I love living in Christchurch is that I can give pretty well to any of my suppliers around the city in 20 minutes on my bicycle there not many other cities in the world with it as possible so these cycle routes that you 're providing are useful and well appreciated so thank you very much yeah the only slight comment that I 'd like to say is that as a regular user of bikes around town and and cars I find brand street can can be a scary place you can feel quite it can be scary in a vehicle even with the trucks Sun what a solution is but I know there there are railways around the place and whether it would be possible to get stuff from the port onto railways up to Rolleston or hawk-i poi where they could then be trucked away I think that would help further improve the livability of this replacable Christchurch yeah we 've taken some hat from the government sort of signalling for the next GPS that 's you know that rail comes into the and to the picture so we 're certainly very hopeful in that regard but did you did you have a question around bronze straight because I know that they showed us one because one one one suggestion to us besides having I guess more lights at intersections was to have graded separations which would mean that you know hell there 's a big high overhead bridge say for example at Barrington Street that they would means eta were put in graded separations at every intersection yeah so just alternatively of course the B changes like for example taking up the parking and heading to the number of lanes available as well you suggested so just wonder what sort of options you think might be best in terms of that of say having havoc stall retaining an integrated community definitely the cycle ways that are through there greatly improved they do get a little bit confusing as you get sort of outside it 's not clear like I just ride along the footpath because the cycle and disappears in front of you know in sufficiently on that yet but Edie and because I 'm often going down there and then I turned down Strickland 's Street so it it doesn 't make sense to cross prime street then we cross Brougham Street again couple hundred meters down yeah the separation the separations good and my my main comment about Brougham Street was that in the car often you feel as I sort of in the Karen is of towering truck sort of warring around you and like I say I think you guys are doing a great job with cycleways and there 's definitely made those lots of it areas of the city more accessible so Sara lucky last question just very and brown frequently in its so you 've talked about prioritizing cycleways you 're aware that they 've currently being pushed out for ten years mmm and they tell you 'd like though that funding bought back to the original timeframe it 's possible well obviously yeah I mean that that great and one of the really things I really enjoy about cycling is that you can interact with the community if you 're driving around in a box I find it you don 't meet people on the road but on a bike that 's great like you know your neighbors heaps better and you you see the kids at school yeah yeah it 's it 's it 's valuable but it 's outside of the raw numbers that transport Venice might give you like it builds community being present on the street so I 'm advocate for cycling will say advocate for the accessible city that we have yeah my business takes me overseas and the and the places that are most busy to be other places that you can walk around Christchurch was oversized sort of town becoming in a true City so yeah very good well that 's a really good note in the evening on so thank you very much for coming along and contributing to the LTP consideration stuff over there it 's a nice way to end the day thank you alright now I 'm going to adjourn this meeting until tomorrow morning at 30 _"

    "text": "Samuel struck wall hi I 'm saying thank you for hearing me too much the main thing I wanted to talk about was the measure of a more awake I believe would be very good to have a cycle way going down more more aware because I 'm there 's quite there 's a lot of people work from the airport and I write down the everyday for work but it 's an it 's not it 's a very good road to write down because it 's nice and smooth it 's nice and straight you know and not too many lights but there 's no cycle lane at all so often you 'll be riding along this is a whole lot of cars and relief so you 've got nowhere to go then you get a truck will just come really really close at high speed and you know it 's pretty frightening you know everybody cotton writers so scare that easy bit so I 'm not that good not just one about to come home to my family at the end of the day hmm and I 's a button b2 had to put on it because there 's grass booms all the way down there so just have to have sort of partner in there in between the trees hmm and there 's some options but it would be it would be probably the most amenable to the motorist because when it cut down their lanes at all and yeah that 's why everything we just talked about thank you Mike thank you I know exactly what you 're talking back to off by a few few times and it doesn 't help when they 're doing six because yeah that 's right that 's right so would you be looking at something like that that 's like alone or do you think of cycle way which is separated well I mean anything speed of nothing and cuz I 've got course I 've got Liam who one going out to happen no II but it 's not any good friend here loving catch me it 's not my bike out to happen or to get to it said yeah we 'll Erin Pauline you 've its that currently there wings two wheels cycle way which is due to gap he would road to the airport yeah would your preference be memorial a of rather than you would wrote o year strongly healed roads like you know that 's that 's good for if you live in pepper knew your north maybe Merivale a lot of the city lifts in the South are there and there 's not no one 's gonna want to take a detail all the way up there to get it 's not ready rich right and since you 're cyclists Amazo ask or would you prefer both um yeah both would be good yeah if you can get it I mean of course you know the council 's only got so much money well because there 's grass verges all the way up more away from yeah dams on both sides so I mean you can 't take them all out because there 's trees they obviously you don 't want to take out the trees but if you just sort of cut out an area for parking or on strip of I saw you did she end up reducing some of the car parking you follow be a slight reduction in car parking bears the whole know a lot because I mean you never get the whole lot completely filled up so yeah and then you just paint a line on the on the road with the cars we 're parking so yeah yeah thought you can tuck done the boobs yeah and what you could do as a for wanted to make it it 's just a few extra safer no extra Koster just put some sort of most placed I can taste all that 's up so that people feel more separated thank you okay Glenn oh thank you oh there 's an underpass I don 't know does that work for you out near it comes out by the old Anglican Church yeah it 's all been solved now because the underpass is good for when you 're on if you got down here would row it but also because there 's overpass you don 't have to navigate any roundabouts anymore you can adjust the light if you got no more and it 'll be a lot of tourists you know coming to the study that they 're gonna go straight down more more people going cycle turning and Esther doesn 't and well you know and the more people you can encourage on bikes with this condition is I want to add to the congestion by rote driving car where yeah well twenty seconds not be quick um this insert if you come from the south while you don 't use the southern motorway and then come along of long johns right well John 's roads not fantastic for writing down either and also I would add to the length quite a bit when you 're on a bicycle you want to take the rest to eat fruit because you 're not quite as fast as that okay excellent look thank you very much for taking the time to come and make a submission aim great prop there Sydney Perth home thank you _"

    "text": "surely community trust Jamie Mitchell thank you as you said I 'm from the Shire Community Trust an organisation what it 's been working in the heart of surely for that nearly 20 years I 'm here to talk about ten surely Road and huge potential that space has now is a great opportunity to do something proactive and positive for the community something that will have real impact on many lives but before I talk to that I want to congratulate the City Council for the wonderful proactive contribution you make to the life of our city into our communities for citywide events the recreation programs not to mention the funding you give to community groups such as ours so that we too can be proactive in our individual communities with that money we hold our annual shine festival run programs for people to connect learn new skills and boost the well-being of both individuals and our community I also want to acknowledge the very generous gift of the new building to McFarlane pockets we 'll manage having this space will add so much in terms of what we our future is great there was an article recently in the paper about Shirley Shirley is a family orientated subbu some sixty-five percent of residents are families with children and about 21 percent of its population is between 0 and 15 this is emption Park the 30 average of 17.8% so after me is great however it also has challenges we have a high percentage of housing new zealand homes generational unemployment and minion a community do not have cars at the moment the shitty library has a security guard there in the afternoons Burger King issues trespass notices and it can be intimidating to walk past the youth past the youth who look on mass near the palms or shilling to mediate that 's not good for a community as a mother of boys and teenagers I 've learned that youth and particular need to be busy with things to do and safe affordable places to hang out and meet friends there was notice when the press last week about youth crime when the gangs were asked why their play was just a youth thing we 've got nothing youth things need to be affordable accessible and appropriate the opportunities tential erode could offer in this space are huge I 've heard lots of suggestions about what would be best at that site escape park a big space where they can be basketball games etc a place for small groups to meet with their storage available all available suggestions the site is close to the Moores and shops on a bus routes are easily accessible and there 's an open public area making it safe there 's an ideal space for any of this above suggestions well I have my preferences about what should go there because you put an a submission what I really want is real dialogue to start about what is most beneficial for our community because I believe the more proactive we are and the more we offer our community and especially our youth the less reactive will need to be in the future thank you thank you oh no no no don 't go away you 've got tons of times for questions yeah so I just wanted to kind of kick that off said you know look look at the other services that you 've got in the area the library you 've mentioned that today the service center and perhaps we could reimagine that site as something a little bit more you know a whole range of things coming together and so and the question that I put to here was well would what would it be beast that we 've put some money on the budget so that we can actually engage the community and a conversation about what that could be because I think you know it 's often in a way that you want to go to an end point because you want to get to where you what you 're going but as you see it if you take the community with you you 're going to end up with something that 's really going to meet the community needs in the long term you know because I mean it 's um as you see that the area is quite mixed you know because you 've got you know you put shirley and then you 've got the richmond down the other end you know they say that 's that 's yeah but okay [Music] well one of the other submissions also made the point that if you look at the Richmond area that 's kind of split between two community board areas and it 's split between the other way between two electorates so you know it can be enormous ly challenging to get everyone focused on on an outcome when the the sort of kind of that the political at the local government level in at the central government level were quite divided so anyway so Sarah you also talked about community funding yes and so do you get some funding yeah and it sees here that funding to the sector has been reduced [Music] foundation feet so you 're supporting the call for increased community funding I think it 's really good to be proud to community I really admire what the council does is always more needy and what do you manage to do beyond the small amount of funding that you do get I mean how much more does that enable it 's our funding so I mean we your insurer we have over one hundred and eighty volunteers and these are people who can 't get jobs so for people as a first stage I 've been on their journey back into doing something valuable in contributing there 's huge you know improving the well-being of that community both health-wise and safety wise and and crime was I think this Julie the team she wrote will say strategically is a fantastic location we need to think carefully about it 's highly visible my opposite Shirley primary school next to some shops sits down from the palms on a bus route in between Richmond and Shirley so and with a high proportion of youth in the area it 's a very strategic position that needs to know and you say what should be useful always as we all know good process results in good project yeah I mean the the thing that really sort of kind of devastated me about the the move around sherry boys as their if that made a different decision around Bank save we could have got that site been stunning but I 'm not sure where they 're going to with that now with the Bank save decision Pauling I think the community center on shooty Road it 's more of a metro type Caesar so it 's larger I mean it was very successful providing for a wide range of groups in the in the in the bigger area so the one that we 've got a McFarland Park is I suppose a microcosm of that which is particularly with we 've got 33 different ethnic groups just around McFarland Park so I think that 's more than catering for those specific needs who don 't have transported have a lot of issues in TLC I think those who are down on shooty Road have have some more ways and means so you obviously photography for the Richmond rich and Shirley area but I think because it is more visible I think there 's more petite thank you for your submission you you mentioned with the housing new zealand component of your community and i just wondered how much housing design and typology should be incorporated into getting good community outcomes with housing and we all know and sure this is the place are called 1950s 60s star and they 're trying to sir condense them beyond so there 's much more you know housing her small area okay again I mean you know when James says about the number of families are and Sheila 's and we still need a larger larger houses elderly people in the area too so again want to get common combinations I guess like in some areas eros that I 'm familiar with that I resent like Phillips town there 's been a huge intensification of social housing we heard from the Richmond people when they came in around the types of you know ghetto high-rise ghettos basically as well I think they called them that had been put in an Evelyn Cousins air I just wondered in terms of a planning process around the community center in a community if we need to think if you think it 's worthwhile thinking broader about the type of housing that occurs around it or the type of community that 's actually been rest of the neighborhood sort of interacts yeah and the housing he 's young and we 're starting down that track and looking at that composite sort of housing so it was a mixed model of first home buyers and sort of read or combination some in a range from one to three bedrooms so it has multiple mix sort of place but yeah I mean because disproportionate amount of rental properties in the area I think one of the key things is to try to bring the first home buyers it 's great look thank you very much both of you for coming along and been willing to to make a submission and be open to some thinking around what we might do about there so thank you thank you _"

    "text": "and Scott Kirra koto thank you for the opportunity to speak today I think we all want Christchurch to be a nice place to live now and in the future and I 'm just going to talk about three things and I was I need to talk about them because I read the films and why Mary here would report on the to the long-term plan I didn 't see myself reflected in it and so there are three things that I 'm gonna talk about today which I value so I 'm gonna talk about a little bits and pieces but but what I value and what I would like to see the the city value and one of those things as people cities are about people and we 're in increasingly multicultural society and City I would like to highlight the importance of our libraries in the space libraries provide access to information for all including books which everyone appreciates but more importantly and often had enrolled as supporting our diverse communities libraries support equity social cohesion and community well-being walk into one of our libraries and you language is spoken the support for literacy which is truly important in our city digital access innovation connecting people together and the many other social benefits the one thing that I don 't want to see from our city is for us to become a kind of Donald Trump society the the cycleway and to get that we need that feeling of belonging for everybody cycleways putting people first in the city by supporting walking and cycling and active transport please complete the cycle ways the city is moving in the right direction and I urge you to speak the faith and and accelerate the change there isn 't and we 're developing something that in the city that be really proud of and I 'm just looking at top cycling town in 2017 and and we should be top cycling town in the world just go for it you know all those people who complain all over the place just ignore them we 're getting there just do it the recent road changes on rusty Road has opened up the opportunity to try to create a cycle way from rusty Road this is the gateway to the city that shouldn 't be a gateway for trucks and we had three schools on that road Burnside hide Christ the king and business and been so primary we have a real opportunity to show the world when they arrive at a gateway that we are a city that cares about people rather than machines transport and climate change we 're about to see a true disruptive change in transport with the convergence of a number of technologies including solar batteries electric vehicles autonomous vehicles and ride-sharing if any of you got time I really recommend that you watch Tom Seaver on YouTube to see some of this but in the next 10 years the need to own a vehicle is expected to drop and has already dropped 8% in the US as the cost of ride sharing becomes marginal and open to all we need to be building for an electric future and not for an existing fossil fuels future building more roads now building more car parts now is a stranded asset in ten years time so I strongly urge consequences of a rise above two degrees for the city are enormous the productivity commission 's report on zero admissions makes a lot of sense and there 's been some very good things that the councillors wouldn 't do it the council should be leading the way on on climate change including the electrification of buses and rubbish trucks and encouraging policies and practices that make innovation in this area easy for example I actually work for the tantrum and we would wanted to use a little vehicle electric golf cart actually to go from item to ducktail campus and we can 't do it because we can 't get across the road we would have to spend an enormous amount of money making it legal so there are lots of little things that could be done that would actually make things much easier for us in the future if you look up how people are going to use these new options you know they 're little I want a little box that goes from University of Ireland to dovetail and just takes box for instance from one side to it should be able to get across the road autonomous drunk rather than flying mine 's different so I just like to thank you for listening to me and just think about libraries cycleways and transport for the future thank you very much is love a thank you very much for your submission _"

for coming and early for us much appreciated thank you yeah please please wait yes oh yes I 'm Dale McEntee and I live in a peppery ward but right on the boundary with the here would Ward and might be familiar because I 'm a capsule employee so I 've followed the guidance and the chief is equal to about 2 billion submissions I wanted to start off covered the main points in the head maybe or say section in terms of width as the balance right I think I want to see focus on safe and sustainable water supply and improve waterways climate change leadership and increasing active public and sheer transport opportunities and use in that order I 'm concerned that the stated emphasis to prioritize work to improve roads is not consistent with the plans proposed strategic objectives concern that allowing increased waste water overflows is not consistent the proposal strategic objectives on the topic of rates I think an increase of up to six percent this year would be acceptable provided the overall ten year it 's less than 4.8% and 30 year less than three point to the question of extra money for Christchurch indeed my feeling wasn 't that that shouldn 't happen and also in regard the Central City landmark grant fund I think perhaps that fund has done its job and the funds could be invested elsewhere now there was question on the regional fuel text which I thought was a positive idea within the infrastructure strategy I wanted to see the council adopt a lower cost transport option with that with an increase of the standard in the waste water area but not not to the extent of the full higher cost option in particular I 'd like to see accounts are looking for condition five wastewater assets to be kept below 8% and the financial strategy I was concerned to see that the fees and charges revenue as declining from 2015 2016 to 2018 19 and however over the same period more than three years ago couldn 't quite follow in my review of the LTP as to why there be such a reduction given we 're replacing a lot of facilities that we previously closed from the earthquakes with respect to the Pendleton here with why Mary Ward 's project document page 2 I want to submit that they funding for line-item a few sticks mill Conservation Reserve Program should be reinstated that was two hundred and four thousand dollars over three years my general thought on service plans was that I felt there should be a reduction in the number of levels of service which rely on the residents survey there 's some service plans have seen several new additions of levels of service reliance that rely on the KPI being out at the residence survey example of what should be asking people they 're having a proportion of residents satisfied with sustainability of wastewater services greater than 80 percent and my own feeling was that I struggled to see how public can be sufficiently informed to make a the useful response to that question or questions are they now for that reason Suba in the West in the water service plan I 'm pleased to see an overall trend towards a higher level of service standard have my written submission I have highlighted a few years I felt there was an unnecessary relaxing of standards because the existing stated level of service seem to be meeting the the objective quite well and I thought the de century from the 2015-2016 LTP there was anticipated to be three million dollars of fees and charges but now we 're only proposing to get six hundred thousand from fees and charges in that area couldn 't understand why that was the case with respect to there 's a level of service in the water service plan around backflow preventers level of service twelve point two point one targets sex regarding backflow prevention as only allows for a gradual reduction and risk over time I think council should consider a target such as one hundred percent of medium and above risk credit properties have backflow prevention devices and also request increased level of service for level of service twelve point four point this target should have been reducing over time I believe that take should be reducing over time to at most two hundred eighty three liters per person per day and 2020 it 's because the water cannery water management strategy has a target that by 2020 water used for community supply will be reduced by 10% on a liters per person per day basis compared to 2010 as a wireless effort does not necessarily have to be spread equally through the region in order to achieve the 10 percent reduction across Canterbury a significant reduction will have to occur in Christchurch Council introduced this measure in 2015 at 298 litres per person per day and it has stayed the same and is proposed to stay the same so I don 't see that less is consistent with councils commitment to the Canterbury water management strategy in the wastewater service plan and respect to level of service 11 point one point one target 7 I believe that should stay at greater than or equal to 10 per thousand properties it 's with respect to blockage complaints the current proposal is a three years to allow 40% more blockage complaints from customers then over ten years a hundred percent reduction level of service how old so I 'm just going to interrupt you because we 've come to the end of the five minutes but I 've just consulted with your employer and she has said that you could be made available to assist us as we 're doing some of these levels of service sure that there was just a really quick things which was the art center operational grant I thought should be remain at the current lower level and there was a question in the strategic planning and policy service plan specifically looking at whether the center operational grant should be raised or not I further still at a pre still not sort of operating it at a level to lift that grant amount you and then I wanted to put in a plug for innovation and sustainability fund and the biodiversity front you 're both in that same put you up to date and I sorry no that 's alright a lot of you think you 've had is in the parks and yeah for sure service play so guy just wanted to put a plug in for that one yep and I had an observation about sports fields having a fairly they had quite a ambitious lift and they 're one of the levels of service and I thought was a bit well as I say we were doing the meetings of to see this we 're gonna make sure that we get you involved yes somebody useful for you to come and see me sometime and we can go through those yeah [Laughter] caning later on thank you very much doubt it that 's extremely worthwhile I 've got that noted _"

    "text": "just leave Robinson here I can see David Lawrence David do you want to come forward and give you a submission now it 's page 185 particularly a fellow pencils or other councils us to say and when I 'm stated on so I 'm submitting today to the long-term plan centered around the social housing issues and I need say at the start that basically I think we need to build more social housing and the council needs to get involved in it and probably the easiest way to to be able to do that is to increase the rates the council 's got a good record of building social houses but in recent times the number of units is actually reduced while the demand has skyrocketed you know you all know there 's been a lot of publicity about homelessness thankfully the government 's finally going to do something about it I think it 's been embarrassing it is embarrassing we have one of the highest rates in the world affecting a global online said that New Zealand has the worst per capita homelessness homelessness than the OECD we 're even higher than New York it 's a terrible situation however there 's a bigger and more major concern I think that 's looming on the horizon has been under the radio for some time it 's the growing number of pensioners and also included the area that physically and mentally disadvantaged people who need accommodation and there 's a big issue in the last year 2000 pizzas but a combination someone 's 2,000 extra penis The Salvation Army report that the number the people were requiring accommodation help will trade into a hundred thousand these are pensions on talking by 2025 and by 2030 over 200,000 pinches won 't_''_163.6 I own a house and they won 't be able to afford rent at the moment 25 35 percent of retirees get accommodation supplements and 30 percent still have mortgages and these numbers are on the increase they 're still increasing there 's a desperate need for single and double bedroom units basically there 's probably more so and single there are a lot of widows and single people that finding trouble paying rents and finding reasonable accommodation is this written fencing of rates and I think that 's got to go it 's it 's it 's old hit basically 70 seventies eighties nineties speak and today the average citizen rate payer doesn 't really comprehend I think that the council even supplies we tools have them don 't know that you own a lot of rentals or they 're not interested and then they wouldn 't know that their room fenced and the council was never actually put money into them they probably don 't even understand that bet Heather appeared maintenance and upgrade and management is all paid for out of the end of the rents that you receive and I think it 's a concern that that you people have about not making it public that you can build more housing and it can be paid for out of race I think you swept necessarily over over rate increases one of the things that I am proposing you 'll take something on board but you know we have a very low rates anyway compared a lot of cities around New Zealand we have an government and insurance monies leaving big short for us for the earthquake damage and so there 's no need to switch over five and a half percent rate increases I think you should get your PR machine running and talk about ten percent rate rises to seven on my heart and stuff like that and in that way you 're going to have a couple of extra 2% spending on housing it 's very easy and I 'm sure you 'll all get really basically all you 're going to give is a few letters to the editor some of these people complaining about you know spending money on housing but that 's tomorrow 's fish and chip paper and you know don 't be afraid of a small vocal minority ask your cultures what you what you and your fellow citizens want nowadays it 's a reasonable expectation that every last citizen has a right to a roof over their heads and a woman affordable higher rates are just another tax and in some ways it 's a very socialistic tax which is a good thing because the the a bit more you know just to put a small proportion to help the less able to be housed should be a priority so I 'm asking you to put social housing a clean and over tune in and to increase the rates to pay for it 's a bit late for that sorry times up so thank you very much for your submission and we 'll move on to _"

    "text": "Michelle Lomax welcome cure DeCoteau my submission relates to social housing provision for people with chronic mental illness so I 'll take the submission that 's read just to reiterate that I urge the council to recognize that people living with chronic mental illness should be a priority group for social housing that the council should increase its number of social houses to accommodate this and that council should provide some funding for social housing from rates to give you a bit of context about what prompted me to make the submission I support a family member with chronic mental illness and she recently had trouble with her landlord this is in Dunedin and we 're a well resourced family she 's got a lot more support then than a lot of people who live with chronic mental illness and she was able to to have her fixed term tenancy finished and so on but it did lead to a 6-week hospital admission in Dunedin and it got me reflecting on what it was like for the people that don 't have the level of resources and the level of young context for the submission so just to repeat I 'm going to be very brief there people living with chronic mental illness have significant challenges in relation to housing and they can be quite different really although they are part of that group of people with disabilities in fact they have quite a unique of challenges if the council wants to ensure that the most disadvantaged people in our community do receive social housing they do need to be making that group a priority I believe in stable healthy hope housing is critical to ensuring that people with chronic mental illness be able to be some life possible given the challenging circumstances that they live in and I 've got one more thing I 'd like to add which is that I would like to support the k ed christchurch submission which calls were a special rate on off-license premises to help fund services for alcohol and drug addiction so I 'm here to take questions if you hear any fill and takes very much Michelle and I think in your full of statement you refer to refer to long-term mental illness is time limited I just wonder if you might elaborate on the East Coast District Health Board at this point and our residential services the error for two years and I 'm assuming that it 's a similar thing here potentially but also there 's always an under supply of those kind of services anyway for supported accommodation type stuff which is what 's provided in the house yeah thanks Michelle I 've got one other question too like you refer to that housing first program what you seem to support and like enters especially say for people who have the long a long term or chronic mental illness so I 'm just wondering in fact ere counsel would have some funding available right now at you with a Mis budget if we want to be a partner with government around the housing first program so I 'm just wondering if you would if you would agree that think that ere council should be part of their partnership via funding support absolutely I mean from my point of view I 'm concerned about the outcomes and however we 're going to if the council is going to provide a social housing program that is appropriate to to be ensuring that it is targeted at most need and I do and I believe that no matter what your other seed of disadvantages are if you 've also got on top of their chronic mental illness then boom you are clean Thank you Thank You Michelle it seems to be a up to an hour counsel social housing hasn 't been funded by ratepayers but by rent pays you get the feeling this is like some kind of sacred cow that has to be kicked to be broken through what 's your perception around that I mean is that a perception of reality what how prevalent is that do you think I am I mean I I don 't have in it and deep knowledge allow him as I understand it Christchurch did you start providing him social housing that was in the nineteen thirties yeah yeah and I don 't know whether it ever has been funded out of rates previously but I said we had government we whatever it was yeah has he ever been raped payer support for council housing well I need that its capital tied up that 's all but no right I mean I think is a given particularly the social conditions that we find ourselves amount with increasing poverty homelessness and so on I think that it is appropriate the ratepayers would be making a contribution to social housing we 've developed know they would reach the end of the five minutes we have developed the ODA tahi Community Housing Trust and what I like about that model was that it brings other providers and social service agencies to the to the governance and that it 's a model that seems to be working quite well so but thank you very much for your submission very powerful personal story so thank you for coming _"

    "text": "but Don Donbas good afternoon good afternoon apologies I won 't be sorry okay point of view hi I 've got five minutes so there 's no time for frills so what I 'm gonna talk about is the cycleways need to be completed in five years not 10 years as presented in the draft LTP why four reasons first of all the silent majority you almost never hear from them they 're not here today or otherwise you guys would be sitting in till Christmas the last time they spoke accepted an election was sure an idea you 've seen the numbers like huge turnout improve the prevalent things that people wanted we 're a people friendly central city with good cycle access that 's way higher than a stadium a theater for rich people to attend a rebuilt Cathedral in a town hall parts have been delivered there are some very people friendly places on the Central City but we only have four of the 13 major cycle routes to enable people to reach them safely on their bikes health we advocate to keep on banging on about and adjusting for population differences is likely a thousand people will die in New Zealand this year from inactivity we get distressed when ten or a dozen died while providing a bike and a thousand people die from not riding a bike type-2 diabetes will cost the CDHP a hundred million dollars to treat this year and 80% are there is preventable by moderate exercise and these costs are only going up congestion which was one of the main reasons why you guys said we needed cycleways a street that is capacity for 2,000 cars I mean to travel 4k carry 14,000 cycles 20% of the cars are likely to be occupied by more than one person so you 've got two and a half thousand people but that 's still in excess of five times as many people moved by bike as by care before taking 20% of road space for cycle lanes can double the road capacity with a huge reduction in cars therefore been thing those benefiting those that still choose to drive projections for congestion and Christchurch based on 50,000 plus trips per day to the them to be made by some other means than the private motorcar this is likely to be a generational change so we have to have the facilities for children to become good cyclists so they can use bikes to commute when they are older waiting 10 years sees another group move through schools without safe into the structure finally climate change the issues are starting to become real you 've heard from too lots of River catchment people about flooding and we 've also considered some stuff about flooding over the weekend it was in the paper do we have to wait for entire towns like Greta thing on the west coast to disappear before we do anything about it transport is one area we can do a lot quite quickly electric cars if depart to play but better if we use the excess energy people have these days there 's way better than building more gems that 's it thank you um can I ask you about the section that you haven 't touched on which is around asset sales and you talked about the fact that in Auckland the she is not all of the shares has enabled that companies have think strategically around other investments for example in Queenstown Airport which we can see the effects of quite plainly from Christchurch so would you like to expand a little bit on that yeah that 's basically my main point Auckland Airport has gone ahead and quite significantly over time it 's been in private ownership and yeah the city I don 't know what the shareholding of the Auckland Airport is but yeah the city have benefited from the fact that the that they have a more strategically visioned group dan the City Council yeah you guys are here to run the city not to run an airport any imports a mode of transport so I think yeah it 's time to actually take some blinkers off on some of those things on everybody it 's all I 'm simply time we raised the idea of s in sales but we all do it yeah we do buy one car and keep it clear in our life we use it when we need it we sell it move on well it 's a student it 's not something that we earn a hundred percent of we own [Music] their 75% and 25% owned by the crown which was the trigger for the conversation and Auckland when the crown put up share on market so yeah yeah it would be 25% from our perspective but excellent well thank you very much for your submission thank you that 's appreciated _"

want to do you want to all come up to the table at the same time and have questions together okay excellent just times yours my nominee John Campbell I 'm John O 'Hara I 'm general manager of Toyota auto tiny so a youth development organization operates in a community development framework across the city and I just I 've got what what since our youth move team leader here so just wanna in so we basically a group of people just committed to supporting our young people who go on their lovely journey from adolescence into adulthood while creating not only as much least cabbage on the way but doing is much taking you know making them us to be a fair opportunity just just before I do stuff it 's one of dollars to just um you guys here is collectively in individual your own father pop up and just the mother father and just to that how much we value the support to through a local community board members and appreciate obviously seeing you guys here to anyone or to we 're not here to tell you how to do your job rather what we 'd like you to do with your jobs and took me around strengthening communities for your community so I 'm gonna start off just again I don 't have a lot of effects of focus or not the best details man what do you that you have details but I 'm Vicki Campbell I don 't have anything goes nobody gable she 's a beautiful intelligent person committed to our community in the last six months through her business she 's invested approximately 35 K back in the community through providing community-based fitness programs direct investment through her business and I 'm not here to promote a business here fortified papa new hire team training life-changing but but I actually wanted to return that debt talk about the return on investment there came so she is stealing deck now she started and taught at home talk about toward home but rather she was able to but to spend to rahowa through the opportunities that she got through the game community funding she started slapped myself and like what did we started as young people and sort of how and what have our weekly after-school programs but we know it 's a weekend Tecopa for order another eight program which has been funded supported through council should we don 't need to become youth week on the taught home prior to starting up a business what she loves a social enterprise she spent a lot of time Parenthood got basically running for this progress within our local community worth here and that business as a young person could Kody Warburg he started to go Papa order again stall for young people kicked out of mainstream education set up and punch at City Council and public high school back in 1996 another person supporting at business is Richie Phillips again a volunteer here needs to me stronger what a marine who oversees a team of five youth leaders some of their young people here here today delivering a king what do you start as young Krishna club debt funding again I guess originally started back I don 't know core strengthening communities funny baby I 'm not sure what it was but it 's not a bad return on bhisma our first ever grant from a popular shielded community board was one of eight dollars given but just asked lotteries from 90,000 got about three that was fantastic because we had no idea what we 're doing we 're young students and we basically sit down before me board said hey this is what we 're doing and I said would you like some money and we see pranks and up even better and keep the receipts and we did outside of philanthropic funding so now I haven 't_''_264.93 organized that we have an organization well pops my 30-plus full time staff volunteers working with my last year we had over two and a half thousand referrals we 've put him back 2.6 million dollars into the city I guess they are funding of that I guess what I 'd like to make and what 's the only but the only amount a bunch that we get which our community gets decided a spent as a strengthening communities funding every other piece and every other piece of funding is decided by policymakers who sit outside of our community against thousands of hours has to say many clever of projects meeting the needs of me this is where the money goes you know and I guess one way I 've been talking about the analogies are by the campaign very rare very valuable and protecting it as probably again the fantastic investment piece you 're trying to think it 's probably the best thing Bank for backwards funding there be sort of get outside of final water so again if people and investing of people leadership 's not your thing numbers are it may be 120 Pro young people weekly a year I say a week and this 10 approximately eight after-school programs after this is just the article once taking around about five hours of planning on running a day over 40 plus weeks a year probably cost about 1 per person a day which is again mess on that I was going to leave it on my calculator I hopefully you guys haven 't you might find it wrong but again not a bad return of investment I think sitting around there comes home visitation engagement out of that grows activities grows events and behind some of these guys will hopefully give me the opportunity to talk about some of those opportunities that come this far no evenings this this is there but the key thing it is a history start somewhere I guess over the last seven years we 've been roped and rebuilt resigned engaged three engage disengaged working with young people now requires first aid motive is expandable Children 's Act have a safety compliance with Christmas management we 've seen an increasing cost of petrol insurance rates running things our community is incredibly complex far more completely said it was ten years ago and even five years ago our young people are more complex they face far more complex issues and I 'm not trying to make us something as simple linear equation to like just compare people versus a great you the other but what I guess I 'm trying to say is that you have to invest in built infrastructure your system of eastern people infrastructure and help people infrastructure has been severely under invested and over the last few years over a number of years and when it break when after a while of us not invested and it will break down so I guess on top of this sort of we have this you know we talk about what does our community need and again this is probably where it can things can 't possibly simplify it a little bit number one need us we store near connection when we store need relationship and it takes people to do that if we don 't our some of our tenants workers who worked across every school and around what the number one issue that they see facing young people stopping it from engaging still it will come up with terms of mental health anxiety stress but all negative factors ask them what that you know what they need these young people need well the indeed owners to an external things happen through creating opportunities for relationship and I guess for us that 's the value of the investment through community funding so Council funding into community again so we 've think surely contribution so again I think so what again brought us done so you believe these two I speak next and you guys can give us Krista 's opposite what mister yeah thank you I state the year but bring that others down because I think we haven 't finished with you yet just a minute I get 12 because she 's still you joram welcome so my name is tatiana moana i 'm

remember night and various other programs we do and an out of Teodoro and in the local schools case Brook and pop annoying okay so yeah the young people that I 'm about to invite to speak they haven 't ever spoken in this kind of heartbeats racing and things but I 'm yeah I just wanted to acknowledge the theme for coming in today and sharing a little bit of how they 've been able to contribute and to the community and yeah so thank you very much Jonah my name is arcade I go to Parkland High School and I am proud of it I started to yawn her at the age of 13 I started last year my first

Rosie and I will underpin love me last year and it 's we 've also done clubs in Monday night 's poverty a young leadership team in mana Wahine we 're also able to get the opportunity to be a part of total and yada who here is giving opportunity to go travel across New Zealand to meeting places longer nilly to Donnie in also a part of park they we do fundraising it also helps us to get in amongst the community and one of our tasks for poverty was to use our skills and talents to get in amongst the community in fundraise for a trip to Donnie yeah still Davao has three great leadership skills in mind um you know for young people to build their confidence both the sub steam and gave them give them hi I 'm Rosie and I got a problem with high school 300 vote I 've been involved in clubs the Monday lock program listening group and Mohini through to her I 've been out to the table the places that I give you up to the a protest from as well I 'm doing the Leadership Program with sort of how I 've grown as a person and my leadership skill set golden throughout and that 's really helped me with my sports and stuff yeah thank you like hockey [Laughter] you tape it I wanna lean some questions to more boxes would you like what 's a young woman in the middle what 's your name okay I 'm bored you could take this one that 's why I wanted to give the experience do you like the view from up here I love it your journey I know that you want to be a police officer but there 's no reason why a police officer can 't_''_1055.03 be a counsellor or me all right shall we open up for questions um Yanni Mike oh thank you thank you for your submission and you 've talked a lot about the importance of community funding the second submission lists a lot of things in terms of our funding priorities as a city and you haven 't really touched on those at all touch on as young people what are the important things that you see that we should be funding we 're doing in our city yeah I just would welcome your feedback on that thank you and thank you for coming in today too more things for young people to do I have to think about it sorry no that 's okay some of the things that we we don 't get to influence at the moment but we certainly have an inspiration to a mic and then in thank you actually mom was very same papa noe over the next 10 years there 's no community capital projects actually programs there 's anything missing in pepper now for the years what 's missing what 's missing unpop annoy I grew up in Papa noise so it 's my it 's my hood hey get this right the key things of Thursday one o 'clock so places spaces for young people so but safe and youth friendly yeah thank you very much for coming in and it 's daunting so my question is actually about this environment how I 'd love a bit friendlier and easier for young people to come in because I remember once talking to a young person that came in and in to speak and I said had a bit feel when they said I I felt like I was being condemned for murder [Laughter] comfortable here so if you have a think about it and get back to us about some ideas about how we can make this space a little bit more friendly would be great the other thing is we do have a Youth Council yeah we do have lots of vehicles which could hear your voice and you could get involved in in this decision making so it would be great to see you well thank you very much and I like to reiterate that I think it would be useful if you did give some thought to you know making this a more connected experience we 're very keen to to hear from young people and we would like to link you up with the Youth Council so I think and you could make that connection for them that would be great thank you very much _"

    "text": "the sticks living laboratory trust you thought [Music] company by someone who is very well known to us always reeks welcome yeah it 's yep green lights on I just like to support the previous speaker talking to the Heath get catch me I know that pretty well myself and I can certainly endorse everything that you see the prime issue that we are raising apartment as far as the sticks living as virtue the wonders you may have gathered if you 're really there 's a generic word on this the matter of climate change and I 'm taking the City Council to task actually for what I perceive to be a great lack of any action on climate change the council has signed up to become a neutral 20c in the Senate or visa way you know may be wrong I may be doing heaps but it 's not apparent to me I will educate Adobe a will inform sort of a person and I just don 't know anything about what you 're trying to achieve so that 's such a state beer is really is the big as the catchment you know the place to the whole of the seas as were still there water well one of the things I would suggest we 've transferred to an electric vehicle fleet which we 're sharing with other agencies we hit the prime minister here but unfortunately unfortunately she got hijacked by well the wonderful thing about the the cashier electric vehicle shearing scheme is that it 's open to the public as well so if people want to use it so at the moment as they 've got restricted sites you know like the airport and they 're just over the road aren 't they yeah so but but there will be more sites as they develop across the city over this year by the end of this year they 've already started so people can sign up for them now and and use them they we currently a case in point my astonishing the leadership they 're moving on to various other things oh the Christian of education was raised by the previous speaker and I wholeheartedly endorse that however I would say and rips Williams vixen or disgusting worse than the way the difficulties of health and safety issues when you 're dealing with rules and and you want to educate children I had a personal experience he a number of years ago a teacher wanting to take his class down the hit get room I can say yes totally organizer but I just got to power because of the health and safety of even get around there there but the best way to educate people about the reverse is to get them out there and enjoying them because our roads there are wonderful assets all of them and we should be providing them as hard as we can well just missing the point also that talking about hitting 's within within your publicity doctrine was community facilities and I say these were this apart Kennedy facilities for reading your just not been used enough coming back to the sticks we were taken on a tour to see done on the sticks in the short trip one other things is on the comp attorney Tony is the major victory on the sticks running down 's a surprising amount of land he were just already owned by the city councillor to do I appear in Lang but it 's not really available to the public and and we would really like to see that the nation once again that 's all comes back to educating the people about about these rules and the other thing to emphasize is that a lot of mistakes that 's an area where the soils are actually very good and if you plant up the banks or the adjacent areas are very quickly rewarded with you know with a lush growth of trees and shrubs which all adds to the I should say by the way in acknowledging the City Council the council has made a lot of money over the last 20 plus years on the silver rose and and that 's ready to be a quarter applauded but there 's still a lot more to be done on the sticks and on the other rumors going on through if you wanted to see just one example on the sticks of a success story right to the very bottom hundred meters between crying eroded in the tide gates was planted up as a project by the still optimistic life about twenty years ago and it wasn 't done and now it 's it 's a pleasure and it 's just about just a wonderful example of what can be done with a woman truly about and another so the generic point I 'd like to make really is there with groups like this living American clock you know we are volunteers we depend and we 're supported by both the City Council in we grateful for that I raced with a little bit except that I 'm probably a little bit maybe sniffing a little bit I have a lawn here because with my engineering background and this is really my statement I say we accept reluctantly that waste water spills will occur during floods you know I think that is actually just a reality and I 'm sorry that 's that 's the engineering reality that if you want to prevent any wasteful schools fingers at any time you 're up for a huge expenditure and I think to make adapter sticks of course it is the least urbanized and so that really means that the potential for Tiffany and sticks at the moment it 's happening in Kristin 's and in due course availability on vacation I think that 's probably as much as I wish to say you know yeah I 've really got very little time so I 'll take them David and Pauline if there 's a minute you mentioned a planting program for the sticks and and have you see that balancing with the flow and sedimentation issues that the lower catchment has as at the moment do you see a need to address those issues first before planting or I mean we have we 've had and we had some substantial submissions yesterday where people are really concerned and about the exacerbated amount of water that the Styx River is receiving if I could answer that the the planting is according to a plan brought out by the plant and the planting is very much on the banks and nothing anywhere near the flow channels so the issues that causing any flooding all the planning that we 're involved with is sort of natives in I haven 't seen any conflict here at all the reason for the high levels in the lower reach of the sticks is wooden skewer and it could be season mutation let 's read which we heard about by students quite through the being slumped in it could be the person the beetle it was wasn 't it couldn 't be because the realize all the mates have just all clipped could be because of weed growth anything which has been Athena coming the wheat and that has certainly reduced the there was a lot of sticks significantly in the last few months and there was diminish the immunity now Pauline I 'll just let you quickly thank you could be appreciated weeks to because here you mentioned that you know we we need to be terrible of the occasional wasteful overflow in the peat and to trying to reach nil which hat would you like as a community member and a right pair I think there needs to be a balance in years eleven except that often I mean let 's be clear the sticks is the cleanest of the urban rivers but it 's state is deteriorating and that 's one what 's our major concern I mean we do a lot of work on a lot of things but the quality of the water and the sticks is a major concern would it be fair to say that mean the pollutants that we should be more concerned about or not those ones coming through from urban development from Preston 's and from so what we 're trying to do is change the behavior of the communities it 's great look thank you very much for your presentation great to see you Rick 's as well and thank you very much for making the time and to come _"

    "text": "thank you um could I have the power ho his cat river network Annabelle hesselman thank you no thank you for the opportunity to present to you today so the ax power heat network developed out of a community response to the lack of integration by the council and the management of the apparel Heath cat river including its tributaries in catchment the purpose and vision of the network is facilitate a collaborative network which advocates for the regeneration of the whole of the empower heap that river our vision is for an ecologically healthy river that people take pride in enjoy in careful and you can see on the map in front of you a outline of the actual catchment which ins is bordered to the south by the port hills to the west by horse oil and Hornby and out to Rekha Tong and in the CBD to the north it 's just below the CBD and then out to the east for the eastery and within that catchment you can see what is unique about the power hip foot river catchment is a variety of land uses land use in the green and the large part of the land use which the river winds its way through as residential then there 's also the yellow which is the industrial area in a lot of the tributaries that feed into the river it she came from this and source so that unique land use and catchment provides a number of issues for the river and the claim to factory power he cuts came to fame as the fact that it is the most polluted river in Christchurch in his urban stream syndrome that suffers from huge amounts of sediment running off from the port hills especially after the fires the storm water contamination of copper zinc and hydrocarbons which come from our brake pads from the roofs in from general cars and on the roads this flooding and there 's a loss of mahegger chi the power he could you can think of is it the filling in an Oreo copy there are a couple there are layers there 's the governance layer above which of the decision-makers which the City Council was a part of he came the neighborhood community groups and these are the doers and they and we is the network I seem to create a link led to a partnership between these two layers now the City Council has a number of strategic priorities at which you know connect to create connected communities the sustainable 21st Century City climate change leadership natural hazard management transport options in a safe and sustainable water supply and improved waterways and you have a number of an integrated water management plans including that three water strategy I proposed integrated water strategy in a series of River catchment visions and values at the project level you integration with six values of ecology landscape recreation here its culture and drainage and then there are a number of integrating committees water issues management team stormwater Action Team water forum to hunger transport and Environment Committee and therefore as a network we ask you are these existing frameworks and committees effective in providing a strategic overview for the management of the empower Heathkit River do we have an integrated management plan for the empower heavy river well I can answer that question No so as a network we are asking for the development of a management claim for the apology that River in order for this to happen we need baseline at a baseline information report of the catchment which simplifies and integrates scientific and monitoring information to be able to communicate that to the community groups and the community at large we need to be involved in the collaboration with the City Council starting from the design and planning of projects in programs right through to the implementation if you look at this diagram you can see that if you 've got the catchment there are a number of stakeholders that are involved and this whole idea of integration which the City Council was a key player and we need to burn everyone together to develop a power he kept management plan in environmental limits for the catchment now they 're throughout from the LTP there are a number of issues that we want to highlight as well so the first one is that the we want seek funding for the community water partnership the community water partnership should be included dollars this will enable the City Council to develop partnerships with community groups such as the power Heath get revenue quick to manage the city 's waterways as you know 50 percent of water quality is improved by upgrading infrastructure but a further 50 percent has to come from a weenus in behavior change and you 're part of the community of water partnership we need you need to fund the enviros program at the moment there are only five out of the potential 37 schools within the Apollo Heathkit River that are involved in their environment schools program resources sought for storm water funding in in the catchment the network supports the extensive capital works in land drainage recovery program and storm water flooding protection infrastructure that 's been carried out in the upper catchment but it advocates for the planting of those retention basins to be walk forward and advocates for ecological monitoring and mitigation for the effects of the storm water and flooding projects and it advocates to inform decisions modeling just an advocate some modeling to inform decisions for future treating and whether there is a on storm water treatment to reducing copper and hydrocarbons reaching the power here at River we seek improve point source pollution and with inhaling stream catchment which is one of those key industrial tributaries that feeds into the river and the one of the highly polluted tributaries and again we said we focus support we want the inclusion of the community water partnership it which is a key way to achieve behavior change it in a means of improving the storm water quality resources sought for wastewater and their power here to get catchment B power we get supports the upgrade of pump station 20 which will be a huge improvement for wasteful overflows in the catchment but we do not support the reduction in spending and wastewater overall it is unacceptable quote thought to be it is unacceptable for funding to be insufficient to maintain current Network condition and so allow the Nick wood overall network to deteriorate the network asks for 500,000 to be made available to allow the flow modeling in monitoring of for the wastewater system this system is vital as it is the system the to identify how best to reduce the frequency and volumes of damaging wastewater that flow into the power overflows into the power Heathkit River we also seek for resources related to the water ecology in water quality improvement fund funding for this fund should be remain at three hundred twenty six thousand for the next two years and then be founded in Delhi it 's an increased level and this fund also forms a really important partnership with communities and is a central part of the community water partnership program the network seeks funding for Part C reserves within the catchment and it supports the continued funding for the regeneration of the port hills to stabilize a reduced and sediment node and to the empower Heathkit River it also seeks the development of an eco sourcing policy for an all-native planting now here is a good example of sediment control within the port hills and the gullies and you can see the use of flex which will trip the sediment some paths behalf of the power he cut revenue I would like to say thank you thank you got time the idea that in fact it 's a big emphasis on education and that education alone doesn 't bring real change but earlier today we had certainly one of the groups who came was that Kashmere high school group who clearly are you know hugely successful water group in action as well as your own so I 'm just wondering if it is would you agree with the fact that because the power our power Hope River network is very action focused that effect you get better results thank you say thank you but also as I can I 'm asking your question the compliance monitoring liaison group regarding waste water overflows who are members of that at the moment we know I know but who was I mean as it made up of council as a ek nor is that I 'm you don 't know I mean I don 't know either so but we 'll find out that you 'd like to be part of this yeah okay thank you very much thank you _"

    "text": "some of the counselors are still coming back if we could if we could proceed though we 'll start with the Littleton recreation ground reserve management committee Dave Sanders good afternoon and welcome welcome thank you thank you well you worship and city councilors it 's a great pleasure to have a few minutes for you this afternoon as you mention my name 's they 've seen this of the long term recreation ground reserve management committee it 's quite a mouthful I 'm still trying to get used to that whole line um we 're on our fifth cranial we 're a small committee as you well know in the Banks Peninsula area we 've got several AMC 's the good thing is our community actual community members are part of it and very much evolved our Pacific our MC is made up of our stakeholders which includes little Trek B which is our main stakeholder little from soccer and Lopes and Sea Scouts and our primary function is managing the council 's they see it being the refreshing ground in papillion for us it 's been challenging and for long term planning for our RMC it 's been a little challenging on two fronts one the first one is the marina development very exciting we 're enthusiastic and I 'd like to congratulate the council for stepping forward on the hard issue around the corner the marina concept is simply fantastic and fair the wall I 'd like to thank the key project team members who have fully engaged us we have been attending every meeting the the timelines that have been sent to us by email just the whole professional side of its being fantastic because of the marina development it does include the recreation ground which is a ninety-year-old gram of a pavilion that was built in 1956 and probably don 't know this but the path or you know is a war memorial to the Second World veterans a second world war three strands of little tongue tiny little plaque tucked away that a lot of people don 't know that we 're excited because we haven 't a chance or you guys have a chance to incorporate us for the future of the ground how briefed you are but it does include a new volume and we feel after discussions with your project team there 's an opportunity to include clubrooms as well because that 's been quite challenging for the law to the Rugby Club so we 've all focused on this building being a changing sheet on the ground floor and club rooms that they wouldn 't use the word cover it 's a big community room so we 'll never be Pacific to lurch and rugby it would be for the wider community and have more meeting rooms in our village cannot be a bad thing the only slight observation and it also negative but it doesn 't mean to me is that my last one-on-one with the project team because our trying to think outside the square I believe under the legislation you are committed and law to provide X number of car parks and the design plan is very much focused around that there was a suggestion of building a new road alongside one of our boundaries but it would require moving scouting that scared me this is a its time comparable to other see Scout operations around the country I just encourage the project team because I 've not heard fear that they do not go down there dread I 'm sure that they won 't I just need to put it on record that as a concern for us because for the sake of excess in car parking please don 't remove a building so I just want they don 't record that 's the other big issue for us and again this is not being negative this is just reality of what we 're dealing with as a couple of years ago a health and safety review was conducted on the grounds location next to the tent funds you 'll recall three years ago looked import company submitted a resource application to Eakin to construct a cruise booth adjacent to the fuel tanks unfortunately perhaps not the right word but the oil companies didn 't want to borrow that and a battle commenced between LPC and the fuel companies they use a scary tactic and got hold of a report conducted by the UK government on e can and it 's very clear to me from my researchers the hell out of them so much so that the risk scores sure that was other issues but the LPC application was declined and we all know the outcome now which is more positive anyway on that front but we were left worth carrying the can because he can directed City Council to conduct a health and safety review given the location of our ground annex to the tanks so two years ago this report surfaced our pavilion was shut down with no real follow-up plan other than a suggestion that the County Council with budget moss porta cons and which would include changing rooms and showers and so forth and another area of the ground that was the first time eventually we ran out of time because we had to get the Rugby season underway for 2016 and subsequently we 've got there in the end of getting back to normal but heaven again towards the end of last year so formally out before you must close again and I 'm a patient man my committees patient health and safety but from a logistics point of view when you 're looking after a community of sports users or you want to some clarity and some definite guideline to what we 're working with we eventually got approval to open pavilion two weeks to the first game of the season so I just want to give you some background just to clean this has been really hard so going back to that review right there health and safety review I met a lot so I do a lot of common sense I 'm from a corporate banking background so I do respect health and safety I respect health and safety but sometimes I think we all all of our skin in a situation that one consultant from somewhere who we don 't know who it is has come up with a risk love you I know you won 't be able to see this but this summarizes squiggly lines and one of the red lines comes out our pavilion which is now understood to be a danger zone this is how silly it is counselors if you 're you 're in danger on the other side one front of this line or in the safety zone this is what we 're dealing with to try and manage a community ground so today it 's not about criticizing it is just about something because common sense has gone out of the door everyone has absolutely scared of this Health and Safety report and I don 't blame them if I was counselor staff I 'd be concerned but no one 's stepping back to say hey let 's have a breather let 's have a look at this logistically and professionally when our pavilion was built in 1956 it 's been a neighbor of the tank farms for all these years there will always be a risk next sort ain 't fun it 'll always be a risk for the whole Lyttleton community but just keep shutting us down because people are scared of this report Mikey misses today there 's some help please because we have some exciting news going forward cambree Rugby Football Union have approved Lawton rugby to go to Division one which this is exciting may recall the early 80s we were senior one then that 's when we hit the famous players early bush and have records and the parachutes the good days a little too rugby and while it lasted five years in didn 't to lean well it really raised our community this time around as a past prison I 've learned from rugby myself that 's a different ballgame but how do we plan the rugby union is asking for normal high level standard support facilities including our grounds in Bethulia we don 't have any way forward to how we plan around there when we have this Health and Safety report to deal with that can shut us down any time we have a pavilion that is aging and then we have the exciting marina development out to the right which that will take some years to probably come to fruition so we 're in limbo and all I ask and I 'm grateful for this 10 minutes it 's just somebody or someone to just step forward to help me help the committee to come up with a plan shutting us down and help us was the long term plan you have a copy of the plan which I haven 't found summarized from my conversation today I felt it was easier to talk to you about the issues were doing absolutely but we do look to re to four reso to ground in South and that 's what the original reports are now so I see thank you very much for this ten minutes I really appreciate it and I hope I do get some support and dealing with this tricky issue I 'm just explains I think you well the deputy me is sort of jumping out of a skin over here with an offer to come and meet with you in the community border thing yeah absolutely I 've already done some work with the community board on this and I mean it was that was the background to how you got your changing facility open in time for the season this year but I agree that we do need some some greater level of certainty I mean if we go back to the council resolution the changing facility shouldn 't be closed down unless appropriate alternative facilities were provided and that was the guidance from Council at that time this is actually a conversation of conversation about appetite for risk around that and constancy of risk assessment we need to make some decisions around that but I 'm guessing the other thing that you 're saying in the context of the long-term plan is that a high priority of the navel point development plan would be creating certainty for the changing facilities for the Rugby Club absolutely but of course no one can give me a timeline on that so we have Lawton Road begins in 1 and 2020 I think we all know the Naval development would not be ready by then by a long shot yes so that makes it even more challenging yeah so I put my hand up to take over the role that Christine Wilson formerly had as the liaison for your reserve management committee thank you I intend to get fully involved in this space to get a good outcome thank you very much for making a presentation it you come and tell a story rather than stick to the thing so it adds value so thank you for doing that thanks so much thank you _"

    "text": "this is the make collective term Chesney welcome thank you g 'day_''_10.4 so yeah i 'm some cheese me from the mate clipped it and let 's want to say first of all thanks so much for having me and for doing this process like i think it 's really cool boys along to witness democracy in action I can 't you tune Monday so here with have a fairly specific kind of response there guess was just to try and advocate prioritizing the hit cut cycle way ahead of the proposed timeframe were 2025 and it 's too far away and so I kind of my credentials is I 'm a keen keen cyclist and a business owner in the central city I use my bikes my primary form of transport with myself my two boys and I guess getting out a hit get every day is something that 's on my mind quite a lot especially with these two on the bike um I 'm also putting my money where my mouth is and to a certain extent our business cyclist screen which obvious 10 a day to attention both here and overseas stuff one News and The Guardian picks it up a bunch the others so I 'm actually genuinely patient about this I 'm putting my own money into it so I 'm just going to want to advocate that so I basically got five points as to why you should accelerate the development of the cycle way to hit kit the first is that I think you can 't overestimate how important safety is in terms of getting people on their bikes of my stuff I still have one despite having a 10 a day and centered to get on her bike who still doesn 't feel that it 's safe enough took like from your house to work so I think if she had a dedicated cycle way don 't make a huge difference the second one is right now in heathco I think unlike other places where you are prioritizing cycle ways there isn 't a direct path out of haircut that are safe and especially for young people and I actually got a couple of things here to get my arm myself simplified us here that show classically the kind of entry into our points of hit go on by bike and one of the most appear is where you have a motorway coming down and traffic merging with motorway traffic which is often doing a much faster speed that same route then goes out through a really busy industrial area with like a lot of trucks I 've had a heap of close calls with trucks and other motorists even with the boys on the back of my bike when you think it 'll be extra careful going the other way you 've basically got a really tight and narrow road that runs down beside the history so once again there isn 't a safe way for anyone to get out of the basic out of the valley and I think this lack of infrastructure is actively reducing the number of cyclists in here good so even if you were measuring the number of cyclists coming out of Heathcote I think you 'd be having a pretty inaccurate mission because I think the infrastructure actively discourages cycling the third point is it and we don 't have a high school nearby and there isn 't obviously without this kind of a safe way to get out of the valley there isn 't a way for most students to bike to their high school and which I think well I 'm not like any kind of fundamental right I think in a modern city like Christchurch where cycling is you know it 's flat and it 's easy and we do have good infrastructure I think going to Lynwood high it should be easy to do but right now it 's an incredibly unsafe way and I think it 's only a matter of time before something happens his goods also the home to the gondola which is the better or worse one of crusher 's major attractions and I think if we had a dedicated way people could use so pickups local share scheme in town and then bike I dedicate a cycle way out to the gauntlet I think you see that itself become a really strong attraction and I think would be a great benefit to the city of stage that we are doing this kind of clean green stuff and having easy access to our facilities and the last point is just that I think that impact I think is he 's look at hit good and say three small areas I think got a small population maybe that 's of the rationale but looking if you think about the impact of that cycleway you 've got almost suburbs between hit cut and town and you 've also got a little tune for which kid is kind of a parking bike um destination no coming out a bulletin and I think you 'd see a long people take that up if there was a bit of infrastructure in place ultimately I think as I have said the cycle ways to me it kind of like a symbol of the kind of city we want to live in and certainly the kind of city I want to live in and want my voice to live in and I know that we are prioritizing a number of cycle ways and I think the Hickock one is just as valid and meantime and I think delaying even that one or any other cycle way kind of sends a message that it just isn 't a priority or as opposed to other things so strongly indicate that all cycle ways including the one to hit good be priority projects so we can see as many residents as possible get on their bikes thanks Lambie thank you any questions Sarah Pauline so though it 's a business things theater um why did you choose to incentivize the cycling and just generally the cycle ways or does it make good sense your business as well may do you provide parking and combination of things mostly like I 'm really passionate about cycling I guess I was just curious to see if offering the center would be enough to get to it actually defied and larger they had one to never be true if you paid with a cycle though she will do it and the reason I guess for that I think that for me having someone who arrives at work having been on their bike they probably got the blood pumping they 're 't notice a documented but my gut instinct this would actually be a long-term benefit to the person has to have cyclists who mean employers who cycle so that was kind of the motivation but really just because I want to see if I could say yeah and while you currently bike you know and it does as well with the boys on the bike as well when they 're old enough you won 't you don 't feel comfortable currently yes make accommodation for people and compromise the safety beside the way I 'm probably pretty bad I guess case in terms the fact that we 're not reliant on parking the walk-up traffic at or when that business for an advertising agency protein that I think well I think I 'm fairly well right up on this stuff so I think like from what I understand like the number of you with a part directly outside a business to go into is actually very few and the vast amount of traffic going into most retail places is park somewhere I was potentially visiting multiple places at once and here I can see where they 're coming from but I think that opinion is probably misinformed that would reduce the yeah kind of the business that button is probably more of a case for me to say the one ways might have more of an impact on your cap traffic then just having parking outside yeah so yeah I don 't know it 's hard to really say without being an actual retailer but I think having a thriving central city in particular where pedestrians and cyclists be really good for businesses if people feel free to walk around freely then I think this can be excellent for the central city and attract more people in there which in turn is good for business just having parking on the street sorry clean thank you for bringing family and I love that look the fake you also began with here get a because I think you 're the first one anyway the thing I 'm wondering about with the gondol I 've heard it mentioned before what about a gondola going down the other side as well so connecting up you 've identified over you know cycling a secret is that another way around that problem with the tunnel and find her yeah yeah I think yeah yeah I can bring a call of a submission about like the little sim thing but I think definitely any solutions that would help people in Littleton bike will be would be great the tunnel was obviously kind of like a big impediment at the moment that just kind of gets in the way so yeah I think something like having anaconda going the other way or like a dedicated morning shuttle that was you know free or cheap to get through the time with a bike hmm could make a really big difference of course yeah it 's a really good I don 't know who use their bikes to go see pretty hardcore hardcore the shuttle is a good idea and it 's great alright well look thank you very much for coming on and making your submission that 's much appreciated thank you alright now _"

    "text": "Vicki 's southward so thank you very much for letting me speak and I first can I decide on to the creepiest presentation which was so fantastic to see and I 'm actually disappointed parent who got in touch with embarrass girls to see my school could join in we 're at Sumner school and they said I 'm sorry program is not expanding we couldn 't you know I was keen to try and get our teachers involved and you know to push this there was no future I won 't take this off to five minutes but what schools there that was summer school right like summer schools not part of this program and until there is additional funding as I understand that there is no opportunity to get involved in this what 's with the fantastic scheme and its really set up for teachers to make things easy yeah just struggle we stuffed in the school garden at Sumner school but the teachers really struggled to find the extra time to get these things going and that 's why these external organizations that can provide that additional they can incorporate is it 's just totally necessary to make it so you 've got to make it simple for teachers because it was so much on that place already well I came across it when I was a member of parliament at South New Brighton and it was just it was awesome you know the whole school was really focused on the environment and I presumed still is today so yeah really hear you thank you like this is on to my topic I 'll just introduce myself so I 'm giving my opinion that 's all present anybody other than me but I would have I 'm a student at the waterways Centre for freshwater management and I 'm a community member of the Canterbury water regional I can 't afford to regional committee I 'm also a month which means I think I do have a real view for the future for my children and a recently approved New Zealand citizen so I have a vested interest in this country long term I hope and I 've got three topics I want to cover its waste firstly waste water I 'm not an expert in this area at all it 's just simply get an appeal to decency it feels to me like we had focus on water quality through the elections and I suppose the focus with the dominie was on river water but there 's a lot of issues around urban water quality and it just seems to me we 're in a first world country it is completely normal to expect to pay for proper management of a human waste an industrial film which is also a component of waste water and to see the council not proposing to put enough funding just to maintain infrastructure and the standard of which if I 've understood it right that the standard at which is currently and to accept that we did reduce our standards on this to seems a bit of a surprise to me so they 're moving onto the water partnership so I 'm interested in how we can get everyone engaged involved in reducing contaminants of pollution there 's a lot we can do as individuals but I don 't think our bit we can actually reduce our rates so I think research you 've cost-saving to be had through engaging and citizens so I particularly highlighting here that they 're already community groups that can support program to share knowledge with citizens as I understand what a partnership is looking at getting a million dollars the next 20 years to really bring those groups together to maximize feedback for a reasonable cost and in reducing and pipe solutions that 's the reduced cost first peak filter system as I understand it cost around one and a half million dollars and it 's the furthest six hundred thousand dollars per year to maintain that unless the contaminants coming through the catchment reduce which a point presumably that would reduce in terms of knowledge the 10% who responded to the council 's water waste survey forty percent or thereabouts didn 't know what happened to store water they don 't understand the link between what goes down and the great that comes out directly into the roadways in many cases and so it seems to me there 's a lot of opportunity a more water sensitive behavior this is just a table up on the screen showing the contribute contribution of different contaminants and the different surfaces within a city and from this you can see that car parks Andrews do contribute significant amounts of contaminant looking at some of the key ones in Christchurch which sustain the sediments copper and zinc and so behavior change in terms of thinking about new roofing materials thinking about businesses and their interest in environmental footprints these days there is scope for for businesses for individuals to make changes to their practice and paint and roof change your copper brake pad a couple of brake pads and put on Capri and these are all things that just need to be just have to keep pushing that message you can 't do it piecemeal I don 't think there needs to be a really defined long-term plan to getting behavior change behavior change doesn 't happen overnight it 's a long long slow process and just for interest actually at the car park from Auckland there 's place maker Scott Park in Auckland has rain gardens that 's making difference not just to pollutants on that site this is a really interesting project to look at from Seattle they have a goal of reducing their runoff by seven million gallons and they are working very much as a community scale and provided an excellent website to help people there 's other things in there like some rebates and incentives but a lot of support to help people make action on the ground and you can see on that how many projects that will you be known to take and work them towards their project goal which is a me for 2025 habit change that 's worth exploring and I think this is the sort of thing that the City Council could do with a long term funding in this area and then cycleways I was wanted to plug firstly it bugs me when I see people talk about cyclists and I 'm I am a cyclist but I also draw and I walk and I bus and so for me it 's really important to have a safe option when you cycle I believe I cycle a small town luckily the traffic was reasonable and I could cycle without too much anxiety my parents having too much anxiety I was one of four so it gave my parents additional freedom the fact that we could places and 30 years on there abouts three out of four but still regularly use a bike for recreation and also for transport and I think that is about having had that habit built up over time in Christchurch at the moment I think I could safely take my child children from the city centre out towards their Island using the new cycle routes the you know off the road was separated from the road but bringing them in from Sumner you can get so far but they knew when to ferry road and that 's a very frightening prospect even as an adult cyclists who 's also a driver which I think gives me heightened awareness of the risks you know I could not take my children there for a long time so really it 's just the thing please continue with the cycle ways they 're really fundamentally an think about we know what 's motivating me to sit here and talk about these different themes and to me there is a unifying theme and it 's about the future and it 's about looking at what we want to see and how can we get there and for me the connection when you think about the city and how its densifying we know the population is likely to grow certainly there 's a planning policy to densify we haven 't_''_502.88 shortly had a choice it 's either to become an increasingly congested city with degraded waterways or a city with beautiful ecologically healthy waterways and an easy to transport be that public support be that cycleways be that working and driving when you need to and there are people for whom that 's really important and I get that but really just look around the world look at the cities that you like and what you think looks good and think about where you want christchurch to be in 20 30 50 years and let 's start making those moves it 's really important you can 't it a very powerful submission so thank you for putting the time and effort into both writing it in presenting it so thank you Kampai _"

    "text": "absolutey welcome okay cata tato we 're here this afternoon representing Kashmir high school sustainability council my name is lief Cooper and with me today are students ends at the Lotte and Josh MacKinnon firstly I 'd like to thank you for the opportunity to speak with you in person today our submission is that the Christchurch City Council invest and having a strong and growing network of enviros schools in Christchurch as part of the long-term plan catchment high school first started working with enviros halls in 2012 and we thought the best way of demonstrating the impact that on various schools has had on our school our local community and our environment is for you to hear directly from our students so in 2012 enviros schools helped us install smart meters around the school for students to monitor our electricity consumption working closely with met Stanford enviros schools facilitator our students ran switch it off campaign which reduced our electricity footprint by 10% we then installed LED lights which further reduced effort by 20% the learning around this was integrated into math and science lessons and enviros schools that other schools can learn from this also the combination of these initiatives over a period of five years culminated into in our school being first and New Zealand to be awarded desired future energy prize which is a prestigious global award would by the United Arab Emirates again it was embarrassed girls who encouraged us to apply for this prize and the a hundred thousand US dollars has been invested 25 kilowatt solar array a two kilowatt wind turbine and catchment will be the first school in the world to install kinetic floor tiles which generate electricity from student first steps through the embrace schools network local primary schools have been to our school to learn firsthand about the sustainable energy sources and we have published articles in national and international teaching journals as well as through social media so our partnership with Umbro schools has had an impact not just on our school but our local national and global community four years ago and vehicles helped us establish our water clarity testing program with the Kashmir stream care group to help monitor the water clarity of our local half years Kashmir students have been measuring the water clarity of the hit-girl river and Kashmiri students have analyzed this data and science lessons and there is emergent evident evidence that the water clarity of our local waterways has been getting worse over the time and the chemistry in particular has been negatively affected by the 2017 court help files with an bios school support we continue to work with local community groups and agencies on further developing this project which is building strong community relationships focused on promoting a livable city with a healthy environment over the last two years embarrass schools has helped us develop a native riparian reserve within our own school along the banks of the waka he stream which flows the rascal environmental of our schools facilitators have helped students clear the previously neglected and overgrown sight an implant over 150 native trees an ongoing program that has above student planting weeding and monitoring the ecological diversity of the site many students involved in this project have never planted a tree before and embossed most facilitators have helped educate our students about the ecological importance all of these amazing things their students have achieved for our school our community in our environment have been facilitated with the help of enviros schools we want to continue being an enviros school and we 'd love other schools to be able to join the network and benefit by working together we can achieve more we do recognize that the approaches City Council needs to manage some huge infrastructure costs but we also believe that level of investment needed to support a strong and growing and bio schools network as reasonable and this investment will generate greater long-term benefits we 're deaf would like to submit to the council that you invest in having a strong and growing network of enviros schools in Christchurch as part of our long term plan number UE and thank you again for taking the time to hear our submission we 'd be happy to answer any questions the council might have regarding our submission kuren thank you and I agree it 's always more powerful when you 've got the students who are participating making the presentation so thank you very much for great and of course this is all being livestream so you 'll be able to play it back for everyone put on your Facebook page and make sure that you 're telling the story look more broadly but just here so has have people got questions Sarah so what is it about enviro schools rather than you know say you know a local teacher the patient or other organizations that makes the funding and connections within virus called so important well for us personally and bar schools has been able to come along and kind of gauge where we are at with the school and where our students are as a group and give us projects that we can handle but also produce that we can explain so I was there as I future energy price none of us had ever ever dreamed of being part of that and actually having that opportunity available to us and there was that was all because enviros schools had come along introduced us to a smaller project that we could handle and and run for a number of years and then kind of things that you know we could get involved with so outreach into the local community and then eventually applying for that price so personally I believe in both schools really good kind of gauging we 're individual schools rep and also we 're groups of students right and they 're able to also gauge whether you know how regular and how strongly that kind of connections maintained and whether they can do it independently it 's really that great experience in the brain to the table I 'm a classroom teacher our high school and the projects that we 've delivered here just would not have been possible without embarrass schools and the the breadth and the experience they bring to the table they know what projects with other schools they 're connected with you know community groups and that 's really what 's added value here Tim thank you and I read it 's outstanding what you 're doing in our community and I wish my primary schools involved in for our schools and we were just at Chuy 's Early Learning Center the other day there and I you 're putting the pressure on your parents to change I know that my lot here and many peers around me so thank you so much that it 's got leadership from now end into the future what you guys are doing so thank you very much Dion like that 's probably a question for dr. Cooper but it doesn 't minister it get involved in this as well that we operate you know we we actually run our sustainability Council is an extracurricular activity so typically we meet at lunch times after school weekends so that 's all done you know with our additional funding we 're lucky to have a virus school support and that you know they can partner us partner us up with Department of Conservation to get trees for planting of a cashmere string care group before doing our stream monitoring projects but the short answer that I believe to your question there 's no so there probably is quite a lot of more scope there for the ministry to get involved is this is future focus and future learning I suppose you know we this is in my eyes as a model that is working and is local and is making a difference to our local community very good all right well thank you very much it 's much appreciated and it 's great as I say to have the advocacy coming right from the heart of the school so thank you very much thank you thank you _"

    "text": "emotive foundation Kristen price good afternoon afternoon go to the Cote Tina photo couture I 'm here to the munnar in the taboo of time to FINA WA I acknowledge all that has come before in this place all that will come after us and my module role as elected representatives particularly during this fairly extensive long-term pain process and obviously many hours of hearings so I 'm from swim at a foundation I 'm from twilight 's of foundation we support to where a charitable trust we support two programs that operate nationwide Chapel to die and enviros schools which is what we 're here to talk about today so Christchurch City Council was a founding partner from various schools back in 2003 some violence was developed as a council community partnership in White Castle in the late 1990s it then was launched nationally in 2001 is that program that other regions could adopt and develop on that collaborative council community model and virus was canterbury formed a couple of years after worth christchurch is one of the founding partners of the arrangement and city staff were actively involved stage coming on board with about 30,000 a year back that thing and the program was within a really complimentary way to the other educational offerings that the city here that I 'm a place based in the local however things changed and in 2009 there was a change of the staff that were involved and the the other partners were dealing with and people there were some questions raised about the city 's supportive enviros schools they 're questions raised about why the city was supporting what what some city staff at the time name is Annie can program and then we had some other really great support from staff the City Council here and the climate smart strategy that was being formed at that time had a hundred thousand dollars earmarked for considerable investment and growth and enviros schools and then everything changed the quakes have obviously had an enormous impact and innumerable ways and it feels for us at time at so that the ability to resolve this situation that we 're in with the city and virus schools and Eaton has been you know understandably complicated 've been trying to find ways to make it work and make it keep moving forward but we 're really now at a crossroads and we really we 've made some good progress with staff about however the issue isn 't fully resolved so we 're here today is one of the many things we 're asking for it you know that you 're being asked to make a decision on about the future of enviros schools and Christchurch City so in our submission and another correspondence that 's that 's come to the city these are the things they 're being asked for by ourselves and also by it came as the coordinating partner so it 's really their commitment to a launching partnership it 's right-sizing the investment to meet the demand an integrated approach is essential we see they 're not council all around the country and we 'd like the city to be an active partner on the governance group so the rationale the reasons behind this so the program operates is a partnership between ourselves who we have a central government funding councils and communities only offers operates and areas where there is support for facilitation from the relevant territorial authority so you see a couple of blue patches there on the map and pakoda in each Britain there 's no relationship with the councils in that area and I secured long-term funding for enviros schools so the program doesn 't operate so the situation one with the city is that there are a number of schools that have been involved with this program for some of that for 15 years because the city was involved and that 's the only reason they were ever taken on in the first place and you know ourselves we don 't need funding at time out of us this is about the schools in your city so the programs are highly valued we 'd since some counts as some information about our recent census very high return raishin Canterbury 92% and we 're talking about quite a complicated thing for teachers to fill in that they put a lot of time into doing we 've surveyed Christchurch schools there 's been no advertising of the program however that is a high level of demand there 's a third of Christchurch schools that have run the coordinator and asked to be on a waiting list to join enviros schools and you can see some comments there from Christchurch schools who once wanted to be involved in this program and then thirdly in terms of what 's being asked for an obese men around the 1 to 250 a level I just wanted to give some context to that and show you what we 're asking is in line with what other cancers are investing so you can see here are the City Council 's in the South Island so Dunedin for example much smaller city they 've got two people based in their community development team and funded from different budgets across the council including waste money yourselves currently we 've had 20,000 through a grant and the funding in the last nine years is varied between 5,000 and 30,000 dollars up and down and then in terms of the other partners so if with may traction in the last few years with increasing community demand and some of on board and you can see in the sort of contributions that they are making and these are all in the context of long term relationships and contributions made agreements maintenance or the three-year cycles in line with the long term plan he can contribution actually have confirmed an increased contribution heading into the 1819 years so their numbers slightly different to what was in the Russian submission so they can contribution in the new financial year will be two hundred and seven thousand which is a mixture of staff time in budget so they 've got a few more slides but I also want to make sure we leave time for questions so I 'm happy to sort of pause at the take some questions and address some time um Phil thank you for your submission one thing I just haven 't_''_387.759 been clear about is the relationship sort of between toy matter and end of iris course Q because explain the connection yeah right sorry so Twitter foundation so we provide the national management and support for the enviro Schools program so you can see at the bottom our moderate development partners so we have central government funding for that and so we 're program development research evaluation resources mentoring national strategy then the program works on regional council boundaries every region has a regional coordinator that 's generally the employee of original council and I 've got Andrea beside me who 's an eco employer she plays that role in this region then every single and virus school works with a facilitator who we train nationally who are part of a team managed by the Regional Coordinator and that 's where the city and district council funding comes in they 're supporting local facilitators and then you go on to schools and then and so and all the amazing results from the program and so you 've got a lot of investment that 's being pulled in from the community thank you so can this really clarify so is the foundation like an umbrella group for each leighton-morris goals so the Foundation has received some strengthening communities funding but you were saying enviro schools has really limited the foundation has been applying for strengthening communities funding on relationship is between the city and district councils in the regional council regional councils can 't apply for that funding so you know we 've been applying for it on behalf of the regional network but the other funding streams that come from the district councils that 's all a relationship and a partnership between 18 and those organizations so we 're sort of stepping in here is a middleman to try and find a way through the situation thank you yes Karen yes so did you say other councils as funding this through their waste minimisation levy rather than so these around about three million dollars a year of staff time and kind value that from their council funding around about ten or fifteen percent comes from wisely refunding and the risk comes from various parts of council budgets and you talking this is across the country this is across the country right I think in this region there is a reasonable amount of funding coming out of waste budgets some of it will just be rates based solid waste budgets in some booths and levy that comes back here from strengthening communities that means it 's not coming from the waste minimize does main active Ronnie because we if we change the waste minimisation because that 's a standard Olivia across all properties of a hundred and forty four dollars eighty three if we changed it by dollar we 've suddenly got a lot of money to put into this or other projects Justin yeah I think I think it 's yeah we 'd have to take some advice on that but it might be but I think we need to take some advice on us yeah it 's a budget that other councils utilize right okay very good any other questions Sarah I just check has been looking at here in last year 's funding from council came through the metropolitan discretionary response phone and read my strengthening communities and why was there it was just two dates yes we not we knocked it out of the yeah yeah and then put it back through that mechanism yeah yep thank you very much much appreciated _"

    "text": "thank you I 'm Tim say well something-something the fruit I 'm not asking you to spend any money I 'm asking you to honor an agreement basically and engineer will probably realize this is the third time I 've spoken to you on the Smitha and like previous occasions my submission is asking for two changes firstly let the future use of the mcdougal out gallery is is you is to be for the city 's 2-dimensional a collection and also the museum 's two-dimensional that collection and its earthquake strengthening to be brought forward to the 1920 year well it 's the same my submissions basically the same as the previous two years I do wish to miss Menken points which I think you might not fully appreciate the point I 'm making in terms of the gift is that there was a written agreement between my grandfather and the 1928 council I 've seen it all to you and I 'll read it out if some day that I 've been out trying matter your archives out at the airport quite an experience I might say and of the letter where the mayor at the time the river confirmed the receipt of the gift of 25,000 pounds to build the gallery and he said that the check was for an art gallery for the city there does the agreement my friend silence later price of that rid I would like to redeem my promise to you in regard to the art gallery gift if therefore gives me much pleasure to enclose my check for 25,000 pounds and the second thing I wanted to mention in this regard was that there 's also written evidence that the gift was to the citizens of Christchurch which I 've been arguing makes some difference and it 's actually on the foundation stone just to the right of the steps that you go in and there 's a zero in it since this art gallery was presented to the citizens of Christchurch by re MacDougall this square the 28th of May 1928 so there was a written agreement that wasn 't just some kind of gentleman seeing way the check was written out and nothing was ever this was any kind looks on public record as saying he didn 't want to have anything to do with the museum and he wanted it to be an art gallery for the city who actually wanted it to be built away from where it was of course and that was in the press on the 12th of March 1928 so once again written evidence and they just want to go on and mention the other point about the museum 's use of it it can 't_''_234.489 be used by the museum for decorative arts and crafts so here it is reasons the conservation plan states quite clearly it should be used as closely as possible for what it has been used in the past so using it for huge great three-dimensional the museum that 's what the museum wanted to use it for Anthony right got the act changed for that reason and what I 'm saying here is that the actor should never have been changed because of the the building should never be used for things like that it 's a purpose-built two-dimensional that gallery and should only be used for to point out that if you boil this thing down it 's not a difficult decision for you if you just can accept the fact that it can only be used basically for two-dimensional as it can be used for large three-dimensional objects then you don 't have to decide to take it away from the museum at all you can still be used by them into their art collection as of course it used to be and as of course the new crackerjack gallery is starting to be used now and that 's a good thing the museum 's actually starting to lend some of their paintings to the new gallery so it 's not a difficult decision for you at all but it 's the right one because if you don 't make it you better end up eventually dishonouring the terms of the gift and what I 'm saying is that no christchurch council to my knowledge has ever done anything like that before in the city 's history and I was one of you I wouldn 't I certainly wouldn 't want to go there and again about the new gallery it was only built in half the size I 've mentioned in my submission exactly what happened the square metre which it was reduced by it was at a meeting in 1997 before construction again very few people know that even the new director mr. Jackson doesn 't know that I mean a whole new generation only remember people have come on times gone past and people don 't know what happened and they are now very very tight for storage and as I 've said to you before the display capacity of the of the new gallery is only in my relations that he made only about half of that of local bodies but in the end of all this as I 've seen in my submission the future should be determined by your obligations and your obligations are to Robert MacDougall to the citizens of Christchurch to the heritage of the building is a category one heritage building and you 're the obligations you have under the hood reject museum and most importantly of all which everyone forgets about is the donors of about to the city 's collection and of course some of them a lot of them have been done so through you through every race it 's not just people giving things but works it 's also rate payers paying for them so then I come to this oh and I just wanted to make one one thing in here something I have mentioned before with the exception of Wellington the people have been advising me they know of no city in the world big or small where the old art gallery I mean every city in the world 's building you out gallery we haven 't done anything we haven 't anything special dirty in your area every city in the world has kept their about Gary 's certainly all the Australian cities have I mean we 'd be doing something we didn 't keep on using it as an that gallery would be doing something very strange on world standards earthquake strengthening oh dear what can I say well it 's good if it 's down there for 21 to 24 and I 'm very pleased to say 's down from 21 million to 12 point 7 million that 's marvelous because of the because it doesn 't need the base isolation but when it 's finished it 's going to be virtually have been unused for 23 years and last year I used the word this was really just outrageous this year I decided on using the word tragic I mean it really is said is not and I 'll be bold enough to make a prediction that by 2023 the questioner it will be disparate to see the MacDougall open the game and this of course you borrow more money in the meantime to build more gathering facilities somewhere else and I got that will heaven it 's barely needed by the collection already and please just try and get it open sooner I 've made the point once again the Local Government Act sections 10 and 11 they have museums and galleries just about music as a core service it 's the same standing as a savior so I know the position you 're in everyone knows I said but I just wonder is it on that question I 'd let you go well over time because out of respect for your patient and connection so thank you very much for making the submission yeah about this at some time are you just going to let it ring there will be a decision made at some time but I 'm not able to tell you when that decision will be made well that 's what we 're here for we 're hearing the submissions and once we 've had an opportunity to hear all of the submissions we will make our deliberations which will all be it 's true yep look thanks very much for coming and in what we do understand your your your passion with us could I am _"

    "text": "thank you Thank You Victoria Neighborhood Association Bob meant I not Margery today welcome thank you to begin with I just like to explain a little bit about how the submission house has arrived at the the VNA submission there was a team of 16 people who worked on the submission and then a draft was sent to all 104 members of the Association for their comments on it and in the submission only those points that I see strong support are included strong means probably 90% of people commenting favorably on that part of the submission the project priorities in our submission I just like to list them the first and the highest most important to us is water purity and water related infrastructure there is no higher priority for us secondly would be transportation and in that I guess our main point would be that we think the council needs to take over the city transport from famiy can 't_''_73.229 whether that 's realistic or not it just isn 't it doesn 't seem to be working effectively at the moment thirdly there 's great concern about rates that we need to defer spending on on large project projects too for example would be the stadium and the ten million dollar grant to the Cathedral and finally the fourth priority would be to lobby central government about changes to the district plan legislation before the five-year moratorium is over in order to just say a few words about each one of those beginning with water the overarching priority in the long-term plan should be water in water related infrastructure how the city ensures people have clean water is essential and so too is ensuring that the infrastructure involved in safely disposing of cleansing storing treating wastewater is it primary importance there can be no higher priority our drinking water is already contaminated compromised with nitrate contamination and faulty wood well health maintenance and chlorination is required even if only temporarily the sewage treatment system is only being repaired with no plan for expansion upgrading or protection from the effects of rising sea levels this is a massive problem on the horizon there is nothing or very little in the LTP about it we do not support deferring wastewater say again the current a sewage plant is inadequate for the city of cinn for a city of this size especially with the increasing number of suburbs and spread outside the city limits although there 's a plan to repair the sewage treatment system there 's no plan for expanding upgrading and protecting the system from the effects of sea level transportation and roading we encourage the council to take over full responsibility for public transport it does not make sense to split a public transport across to local government agencies the council and he can the council is the appropriate body we fail to oversee planning and tendering as well as the infrastructure public transport should be seen as a service with some cost recover but not a full income stream we would urge the council immediately or as soon as it 's practically possible to reintroduce the electric or yellow bus system as soon as possible there has been a unanimous support from the VNA membership over several consultations regarding this turning to rates and major projects many of our members are concerned about the regular rates increases effect will be greater than 5.5 percent many of the members do not did not support the targeted rates for rebuilding the Cathedral we therefore cannot give blanket support for other targeted rates without knowing what the projects requiring funding might be we do not support funding both the stadium and Morton 's metro sports facilities as two separate facilities the operational costs alone would be prohibitive especially when added to the operational costs of a large Convention Center in regard to lobbying central government about the district plan we think the council needs to do this for a change in the legislation before the five-year moratorium period is over and the reasons are this some of the reasons would be removing or we 're making significant changes to the rule requiring a minimum of one residential dwelling for every 200 square meters in neighborhoods such as ours this is failing absolutely phase and failing within the four avenues to making it more difficult for residential activities to be located within a central city living zone it 's far too easy we think for non commercial for commercial entities to and cannot expand three removing protection of the financial commitment made by hospitality operators within the entertainment precincts for example Victoria Street especially since it has now been over five years since most of the bars opened and no business should expect ongoing protection from Central for the personal business decisions and finally clarifying the rules related to short-term accommodation facilities within CC Living zone especially in relation to purpose-built accommodations such as multi-unit Airbnb developments without the owner living on-site thank you thank you and that ties on that last one was a number of submissions that we 've received also from the hospitality sector about the level playing field required with respect to Airbnb so very timely comment has anyone got any questions right Danny thank you I know it 's all the sorts of different process in terms of the district plan you 've talked about making it harder for non residential activities to go in have you got any concern about some of the residential developments that are allowed to happen in the area either white or density or no principle we say it 's residents we don 't want our encroachments and to the existing residential areas I 'll give you two examples The Salvation Army took over 4200 square meters of the corner in Colombo Street in Sulphur history that was residential and some of it was on residential l4a which is allows for churches etc but the size and scale of that took a big chunk of land a residential land out and I 'll put this against the backdrop of the City Council saying for years now but they want more residents more residents and more residents living within the inner city you cannot and within a one-mile Square area continue to gobble up residential land and still use that as your mantra second one is a rumored development next where the christchurch bowling club used to be and while I have every sympathy for that project and the need for it within the city to just to sign it in prime residential land if that 's to go ahead it would be another another sacrifice of the the long-term goal of the council no we don 't have specific clean thanks 's we are doing some background work on that assembling information but can you give us a bit more anecdotal yeah one of the things about air B&B is that it becomes the motel a hotel and you only have there 's nobody actually living on the premises somebody different delivers the key or the key is picked up at a at a central site and people are there for a night two nights a week or two often half the places there are no lights on at night there 's no commitment to the area it is not residential in the sense that that we want we want people living in the area contributing to the area and increasing the safety in the area after dark and Airbnb Hotel type of type of arrangements where you have absentee management like that is a great worry plus it 's going to exacerbate we know this is going to become a crisis in any when all of you do it exacerbates the parking problem particularly in within the four avenues but if you 've got a 15 site 15 apartment air parked there overnight and it becomes it becomes a real problem even when residents permanent residents out there I don 't thank you for that that much appreciated I mean obviously there are a number of issues that you 've raised and your submission that we shall have a good look at so thank you very much _"

    "text": "very much thank you all Nick grew quite tiny water toy hey Katherine peeps and we really to respond to questions the point of this submission is really to promote oh that 's not oh that 's fine yes that was an extra thing it was the power point thing that 's fine the point of this submission is to ask for an opportunity with the City Council to look at what we have chosen to call a new way of working and we have experienced it in the community water partnership approach and we would love to work with it in some sort of focused way because it is I think it really reflects the the initiative that the City Council 's taken in relation to takaku takaku CUDA and to Hana and I would like to just see if we can 't do something to support you on this our problem is that often the groups that worked within our sector when I say our sector I 'm talking about the third sector the NGO sector the nonprofit sector the freed sector don 't care what we call community initiatives and community this is and building community and all that kind of thing which is fine of course we all want building community but there is something distinct in our sector which is happening and that is some very thoughtful work on strategy and policy and it 's emerging all over the place and it 's coalescing and there 's a course that 's being offered at the WEA actually which is just starting tonight on the transitions from a new society and so on and we just know that people want to do in relationship with tality Noah so we 've picked on this one little hook in the LTP which is talking about the possibility of three full-time equivalent staff for the community water partnerships development we 've applauded the inclusion in the project of the relationship with E Ken and Worth Department of Conservation and we would love to see the appropriate third sector organizations picked on to the difficulty with using the language of community groups and supporting communities and empowering communities is that everybody 's part of the community City Council 's part the third sector organizations that have this interest and strategy and policy which is why Network wide tongue has been very supportive of one voice through our core time which is just a register of groups that want to work together with commitment to a treaty based future that 's ecologically sound I mean that 's really all it is but it is drawing together a lot of groups and conversation in thoughtful outcomes so we 're kind of wanting to say please fund these three full-time equivalent positions we have experience of working a little bit with the community water partnership and we think it 's a really good framework but it was the only one we could find in a long term plan to make this point about the use of the term community groups taking time to address that and think please carefully about the fact that not all group are interested in strategy and policy many people are interested in providing a service or providing doing little project planting some trees and these things are all great you 're not criticizing them but there is another to I think support a new way of working as we move forward and I just congratulate the City Council for starting that process with the establishment of Delano moment so Kristin 's there is another slide there we may feel heavier quite a pretty one yeah there we go that 's that 's what one voice does and it 's that good old interest of the state that must not be controlled by the state they organize the realm of voluntary activity it 's a very ancient statement but it 's a very true statement and so it 's this bunch of people but want to work together and are working together and are learning heaps together and we just want to contribute as a collective into the City Council thank you questions there 's one more slide oh sorry it 's what you said last time there we go before yeah the biggie for me is only ten percent of these hundred fourteen thousand third sector organizations in New Zealand have any paid staff at all yeah and a lot of those are the thoughtful ones the ninety a biggie it is questions challenges you 've been very clear Odion thanks for the the submission obviously that partnership is very important just digressing a little bit more from from say just the water partnership what other opportunities do you see for for the councillors a wider body actually to be more involved in these partnerships especially worked under two people work well the N was it the greater Christchurch partnership meeting and I was fascinated by the fact that today no longer Toby 's got this new were report all ready to go and shareable that 's that was a great thing to find out about and the the thing is that people in our sector have been working I 'm actually doing a workshop at the National adult and community education conference on relational politics which is a follow up to the matter key my EMU leaders forum report and basically what we 're looking at is what are the what are the challenges for organizations to start learning to work in a relational way with terms of Ibelin and one of the educational things that have on Wednesday morning to further discuss the educational changes in the curriculum so we 're doing some really heavy stuff in that area and it 'll be lovely to share it at the local level and kind of put it into practice because you know I often think that we do stuff at the exact level and we don 't make it work on the ground and network worked on your totai he has always taken the view that we need to do it on the ground so we 've been doing it in the NGOs because the statutory sector has got soaked as it does as I usually do but you know the statutory sig has got bogged down with a lot of legal substitutes for treaty relationships so we 've got a lot of this treaty principle stuff we 've got this biculturalism stuff and I mean bicultural just means two cultures we should really be talking about the relationship between the indigenous people and everyone else as a bilateral arrangement there 's a whole lot of language that we 're working on with with Minister Davis at that word bicultural can make you feel quite invisible it 's it 's will meant I mean I 'm not I 'm not the people actually it 's really short head for the treaty but why don 't_''_503.99 we get better at using the right language but the people who can do that fastest are in our sector because governments have got you know all that statutory stuff to deal with it 's like when Helen Clarke mr. cotton socks changed the reference to the treaty in health policy and she thought it was she was doing a good job I growl at her then and I 'll still keep running in it and that that she she said let 's talk about partnership protection and participation well there 's a Maggie elder said to me not so long ago hexley what I wanted to be for the partnership it 's a relationship let 's look at who 's got the power whose language are we speaking for example you know partnership is another slick wish protection he said no thanks participation not sure anymore actually you know I mean a substitute for their expression by tongue to be an hour to invite us all to share believe now the multicultural strategy is taking it to mr. Davis Christchurch multicultural strategy because there forward that we 've got Jamie actually says that at first the land welcomed the first people and then the people welcomed the next lot and then the job of this people here this to welcome new migrants all in the spirit of manake toner and kaitiaki toner there 's just so much that we 're doing all the time in the third sector which kind of I feel is not communicating with my city council or that 's what I 'd like to do so that we can actually try and make it real in it and we have to stand small we have to do a project and I clicked on this one because we know we 've been part of it and we know that that that 's some good people there so excellent well thank you it was some very it was great well done and you 've taken us right to the end of your submission so thank you [Laughter] _"

    "text": "committee for Canterbury Aaron Jackson you 're not Aaron at all you look like Aaron but you 're not Aaron mr. Jackson my name is Gary Jackson with me is Marc Christiansen and I think you 're probably familiar with Marc more so than with me we are here as ladies of the committee for Canterbury and being here I do extend apologies from chairman Gill Cox and exec director Aaron Jackson who interned prepared the written submission that you have received and our role today is really just to speak to that submission at a relatively high level to give it some context and direction so I 'll lead straight into that given the time available in doing so I will touch primarily on two subjects which again are in the written submission the overall subject of transport and transport infrastructure and secondly the heading of the facilities very brief background for those of you who are not aware of the committee for Canterbury I think the most important thing I can share with you is that the committee for Canterbury is very much modeled on the Melbourne initiative growth and the prosperity and the vibrancy of the city of Melbourne particularly over the last 20 to 25 years that is a direct result of the formation in the early 90s of the committee for Melbourne and the processes and the engagement they have had with community with city government with territorial authorities and state government and our model follows that closely so we 're not at that stage yet but that 's the background founding principles independent objective apolitical long-term and strategic we 're not interested in working within you know short-term electoral confines inclusive and the membership list you will see on the back page of our submission outlines just how inclusive we are we are probably the only group that can represent and does represent young people NGOs community groups business large and small and and that 's the basis of everything we where we come from researched and formed an evidence base we 're not here to push opinions as such we try to work with facts driven by vision and values and this is an important point I want to emphasize the vision and the concept of the prosperity for the region across social environmental cultural and economic aspects we would all went around the room we would all define prosperity differently some of us would promote some of those over others but they 're all involved our roots were based on effectively the geography of Canterbury the whole roots of this province in the whole town and country relationship so effectively we 're city and country or city and Canterbury ok transport infrastructure the points we would like to make to you in support and as an extension of the submission that you have whilst the LTP that has been drafted as understood and acknowledged as a city council document and process and I fully on that we hopefully understand that 's what that process is the point we want to emphasize is that the city in this case from a transport and infrastructure viewpoint has also got regional responsibilities which in our view need to be recognized and empowered within the content of the LTP put simply the whole transport plan for this province which Christchurch is a critical piece of needs the city boundaries and beyond whether that be the port the port whether it be tourism whether it be people enjoying that easy access from the city to the mountains or the rivers to fish wherever they 're their own interests maybe and we fully understand is the committee for Canterbury that there are a number of other parties involved in that discussion I 'm not asking the City Council we 're not asking to solve all of those issues NZTA the mayoral forum other District Council 's and so on and the point we would make is that transport itself we can all sit and debate the future of the car and forms of transport but there is no doubt that transport in the widest sense of the word goods people electric petrol trucks trains whatever it may be transport is vital to those for prosperities that I talked about a moment ago and it 's got to be done right because as a region which you as the City Council are a key part of this is a competitive business if you look at the growth of what 's Bay Northland will its new political connections we are in a competitive business whether it 's for residents whether it 's for lifestyle whether it 's for tourism whether it 's for industry whether it 's for educational growth whatever and in that competitive environment transport effective transport is critical transport strategy transport delivery we get it right we have a competitive advantage if we get it wrong if we 're just a gridlock city because the motorways don 't flow through into local job into local roads and so on and so forth we 're at a disadvantage and it 's a fast-moving world particularly with what that other growth is going so we urge you as a council through our submission to take that leadership role that 's necessary not just within transport planning for the city but a leadership role within the other forums that underpin that and the other stakeholders secondly with regard to facility season I guess this leads into the subject of the stadium we understand that two hundred and fifty million dollars or so is allocated to a new stadium and the acknowledge the discussions and the progress that have been made since the drafting of the LTP on the subject of the stadium the committee for Canterbury supports the multi-purpose multi-purpose stadium project and principle and the progress being made we recognize the minister 's support that has been gained and we recognized the role that the Christchurch City Council has played and helping get it to that music to that point where we are today with regards to the I guess the input from the committee for Canterbury to you on that subject we urge everyone including I guess this room and the council and all of our contacts and networks to regard it and push that it is a regional asset this isn 't a Christchurch City Stadium this is a regional asset at least for Canterbury if not for the South Island and we won 't give them debate about Dunedin at the moment but it 's a certainly a regional asset and we support you on that but we need you and we look for you to push that also we make the point that that stadium critical part or a certainly a very important part of what we would call the social prosperity of the region it 's not a stadium and our view for rugby fans and I know that 's I think your view as well it is far wider than that that 's a story and an angle that we should all continue to push the committee for can debrief through again our values and our principles we intend we will advocate for the debate we will take a leading role around that debate we 've got it on hold at the moment till we understand a little more the current position of the minister and government but we we are ready to publicly and engagingly with number of different stakeholders and viewpoints bring that debate to the fore to help contribute to a consensus decision we are fully prepared as the committee to support the Christchurch City Council 's leadership on this issue on the subject within other groups and other forums such as for example the mayoral forum across the the tas of the Canterbury region because we know there 's come in and within that forum where I think we do have credibility to also support the role of the Christchurch City Council at the same time as we do that we were also just from a committee for Canterbury viewpoint and that opportunity we have with you today to say that the Christchurch City Council in our view also needs to show strong and positive leadership on this issue individually and collectively because I think this is an area where we all need to be on the same page and telling and selling the same story for the benefits and the principles that it represents so you worship the mayor thank you for the opportunity I think I 'm just within the 10 minutes but if there is any time got 19 seconds to go but I really wanted to ask about the really kind offer to talk to the rest of the region about the different funding models so you 're not suggesting a funding model but just to explore the types of models that could be used for funding exactly we 've made the same submission or and whether or not we will be presenting to those councils individually I 'm not sure but whether it 's through like we will go and seek separate discussions if we need to and present to their regular council meeting but equally we are more than happy to get involved in the mirror forum process yeah and I might be you presumably you wanted to do regional transport yeah really for Sano for obscenity of the transport right across Canterbury do you support the hierarchy I guess that goes active transport public transport Freight I 've got a view I guess it 'll only be an individual done we don 't have a view I don 't see me as a committee I think to be quite frank as a committee we wouldn 't be putting it into hierarchy we I wouldn 't be sitting here saying if I get the clear purpose of your direction of your question I wouldn 't be ranking any one of those over the other I think they 're all important I think wide in the discussion I understand that because the I think and that 's appropriate for the city but in terms of the region there are connections between the different districts in the region and those two port well with the two ports and the in the airport as well so thank you very much for your time and effort we we may well be in touch regarding your extremely kind offer thank you thank you very much _"

    "text": "that 's the time allocated so thank you very much could I invite the Christchurch Cathedral reinstatement trust Victoria Hin stop thank you this is a nice segue really into the next submission so good timing here welcome thank you mr. Gus tree good afternoon the establishment of the Christchurch trust with me is out cheerfully to go through in trustee Carter I was listening intently to the questions that were asked me and I 'll be covering some of those off as many as I can I want to thank you for the opportunity to be heard and I thank you for your commitment to the reinstatement of the Cathedral which is at the heart of our city your ten million dollar grant represents a significant contribution to that reinstatement project I would like to talk to you about timing and the trust shares the concerns of mr. Hawley the previous submitter the I reiterate that it 's critical to the success of the project that the funds are received within the stage one which is anticipated to be about no more than seven years and the trust asks 10 million within that seven years and not the ten years as proposed can I talk to you please about the joint venture and you asked some questions about that the joint venture is to be established and the trust as an equal partner to that venture with church property trustees and I 'm happy to confirm that significant progress has been made on the establishment and on the negotiation of venture agreement that agreement is it 's critical to and underpins the joint venture project going forward and whilst it is not yet signed I can tell you that it is closed and that the trusts are happy to say that we see no real impediment to that agreement being signed we are conscious of the requirements of church property trustees and respect of the definition of guarantees were secured or assured and we 're working our way through that and how it impacts on the joint venture itself as part of our negotiation but we are certainly very close one of the first tasks of the joint venture company when it is established will be to confirm a plan that will provide the timelines that you 're asking about and will provide the projected cash flow flows for that stage one or that project so the trust ascertain expect that that project delivery plan will be confirmed within the first six months of the joint venture company being a step that significant work has already gone on in the background on behalf of church property trustees in relation to that but it is up to the joint venture company to own that plan and to confirm the consolidated project and every plan so if it 's helpful to you the trust can say that at the point that that consolidated delivery plan is ready we can come back to the council with some more certainty about exactly when within the first seven years that money will be required so I hope that it answers some of the questions from the previous submitter I also like to talk to you about the fundraising itself and I can confirm that the trust is well underway with the development of our overarching strategic fundraising framework we have engaged with the experience timelines for a consolidated capital campaign to raise the funds for the reinstatement of the Cathedral we are well down the track with our key resources study and in this regard we have significant lead gifts and the networks have already been identified as to we were going to pursue the the major part of those funds that said the trust is very confident that we have a really solid basis for a successful capital fundraising campaign I would like to give you some key messages today if I may I want the council please to remember our Cathedral and I want to remind you that every stone and every pillar and every wonder window reflects the history of this of the city and of this region and I asked you to reimagine that same Cathedral and I ask you to share with the Trust 's vision and restoring that broken icon to its former glory for this trust the project is all about reconnection it 's about reconnection with our people and it is about reconnection with our community and the project is about revitalization it 's about looking this your 10 million dollar contribution paid within the first seven years that we are seeking really is essential to the reinstatement of the project and is essential for the revitalization of the heart of our city we 're happy to answer any questions I note that I 've covered some of those time rooms and given you some indication as to when you can expect at the time thank you well I mean I haven 't had the opportunity to say thank you to yourself Peter and to others for stepping up and taking on this role it 's a huge role but the city is very grateful for what you 're doing for us so thank you um Glenn thank you could see all given that restoration projects all builds rebuilds rather team to blow out in terms of time and cost more than new building is probably given the uncertainties what kind of certainty do you have that you know you might require anyone 's funding at a given point of time because I mean in this case it could blow out over seven years 10 years didn 't so there 's been a lot of a lot of time and effort calculating the cost to reinstate the Cathedral we 've had a number of different leading quantity surveyors to come up with a budget cooker and the other thing about that is putting some discipline around the joint venture board and a joint venture company to actually deliver the reinstatement of that Cathedral for the budget is sit as part of the the funding JV agreement that is being negotiated at the moment and that will happen and that 's why there 's a lot lot to work through that we are very confident that a we 've got the budget right and also that we 're putting the motions in place to have the right discipline for the joint venture company to deliver the reinstated cathedral for the budget that 's been seen probably an unfair question bitters are possible to land on a kind of time contingency as much you know as much we can build in cost contingencies that Diras I 'm not really in a position that I can say that here the program Jimmy families in the framework so I just want to know your framework well including your funding campaign your funding the target in the timeline turn on your patellar mention let 's focus on your first year seven years or spray over to the ten years your family I 'm sorry I don 't sure what the question is your setup the funky-looking pen in the pocket from you sir yes your type of how much funding you 're working it 's still being negotiated as part of the joint venture agreement and we 're going through processes to establish at the exact budget of what Annie and what that 's like what how much fundraising we have already taking account of the council contribution and then what we need over and above that so that is that is what exactly what is being worked through as part of the joint venture agreement and unfortunately because they still being negotiated we can 't disclose and figures in facts from that negotiation current it 's it 's one of the few remaining points that we 're working on is I mean it 's clear that the council is in support of us and he 's you know the intent of the the two million dollars original resolutions and they that our 10 million the rate payers ten million dollars was to go towards it after the other sources of funding from crown and church it wouldn 't necessarily be for Stage one it was for the whole reinstatement project I 'm just wondering how that first with your fundraising and things and it also sees that we would apply it and that we could have just asked down should fundraising exceed so we 'd want to be assured that you weren 't just fundraise and taking our ten million into account but you were aiming for more than that for phase one the council thirteen million even if it 's Larson will still be needed fundraising for the later phases what we always do fundraising I just clarify because our resolution doesn 't talk to the different stages it talks to the project as a whole and that hours would be so that the last sort of funding that what 's the second phase what 's the next phase after the Aces isn 't that the tower in the major the major cost is phase one which is a main TV so we are and for phase one at our separate projects that always has been and the ancillary buildings are separate as well and then the second two phases will all be raised through fundraising yeah no no yep thank you very much and as I said before these things don 't happen these people are prepared to step up and take on these roles so thank you very much for what you 're doing for the city thank you _"

of you this afternoon to speak to the submission by church property trustees in support of councils commitment to a 10 million dollar grant toward reinstatement of the cathedral CPT 's the owner is the trustee of the cathedral trust christ huge Cathedral seat beauty and the diocese have for the past seven years worked hard to recover from the physical damage caused to its properties as a result the earthquakes it 's well advanced and its earthquake repair and rebuild program and it 's one of the largest private owners of heritage buildings in the country with over 70 sites and close to 100 separate listings to recap in May 2017 the Bishop exercise to powers under the CBA to receive the Cathedral decision on the future of the Cathedral for the consideration of senator in response to the impending decision by Senate the government made an offer to cpt in support of the reinstatement option suspensory loan establishment of a joint venture to deliver the reinstatement establishment of a fundraising trust legislation excellent progress has been made of course on all those matters Christchurch City Council 's response was a vote to support in principle a 10 million dollar grant and support of reinstatement the support offered by the government and Christchurch City Council have been strongly characterized as providing certainty and this was no doubt a critical factor in senator decision to reinstate the Cathedral these commitments remain as conditions of Senate 's decision on 9 9 15 30 2017 to reinstate the Cathedral I 'm here before you today to request that this council confirms its commitment in support of the government 's offer to provide a team million dollar grant toward reinstatement of the Cathedral in a minute that provides that the certainty required cpt asks that consistent with councils position that the reinstatement option provides certainty that it carefully considers the potential impacts on the reinstatement project of the timing of funds availability in the imposition of any chronic conditions the total funding required for the seven to 10-year project is directing church property trustees to bring about the reinstatement of the Cathedral comprises teams to be satisfied in order for the project to proceed this includes among other things acceptance of the Christchurch City Council offer and no significant work to commence on each part until funding sufficient to cover the total cost of each part has been guaranteed inclusive endowments the first phase were part of the project which is the reinstatement of the main cathedral building requires an estimated 98 million dollars in funding to commence consistent with Senate resolution church property trustees will require Christchurch City Council funding of 10 million along with the crown and greater crutch building stress funding to be guaranteed in order to meet the funding requirements of that first the first phase is estimated to take seven years the Christchurch City Council grant proposes a lot in the draft long term plan to be funded via a targeted rate would therefore need to be received within seven years into the nineteen years as currently proposed in the draft long term plan consistent with the resolution of Senate church property trustees cannot commit phase one until that 98 million in funding for the estimated seven year period is assured choose puppey trustees in the cathedral Raines Christchurch Cathedral reinstatement Trust which has the government created fundraising trusts as future partners in the proposed reinstatement joint-venture entity will be responsible for the reinstatement project and they view the confirmation of funding including timing and any conditions is critical in agreeing to the freestanding statement in conclusion church property trustees supports Christchurch City Council 's commitments as referenced in the draft long-term plan to contribute to funding of the reinstatement of Christchurch Cathedral through a two million dollar grant and strongly urges Christchurch City Council to amend the long-term plan to ensure that the funding of ten million dollars toward the Cathedral reinstatement is able to be provided within a time frame of not more than seven years as opposed to the current teen years in order to provide the necessary level of certainty to enable initiation of the project in successful completion within the ten year forecast property trustees looks forward to the day that it can announce that all necessary support has been including the team winning from the are secured in order to enable the launch for phase one the insane thanks very much given could I start with the the reinstatement joint-venture and thank you for the diagram it was in your original submission and I felt that we found that incredibly helpful because it 's probably something that that I and in perhaps the city don 't have any particular visibility over because obviously details are still being worked through but can you give us an idea of when that joint venture agreement as likely to be reached and have you got any further in terms of appointing a chair speaking after us but negotiations being fruitful at Sur it 's a complex agreement and we 're optimistic then in the very near future an agreement will be reached so they see as to the first question the chair the independent you know Jeff so we 're working through a process currently of arranging to seek directors and the chair for the joint venture entity that process is currently underway right so I 'm just want people to restrict questions submission you know obviously there 's a degree of delicacy around some of the arrangements yet to be entered into that 's why I was came to know when the joint venture would be would be established because I 'm I 'm sure that they will assist Bucky do you have any given that part of the importance of the cathedral was the 70 that have created do you have any lightly start date as the first question and the second one is doesn 't matter to you if we have an agreement with you the way in which we raise the man suspecting not so if we 've got an agreement with you to pay a certain amount every certain time doesn 't matter to you how we raise it there would be correct as long as we have the money at the time that it 's needed and that 's that 's the critical aspect in terms of any idea of staffing the reality is that these preliminary work that can be undertaken before there 's a start to the main phase one being the the reinstatement of main reinstatement can 't start until let money as a shirred for that project obviously to commit so that the contracts and in the works to some extinct and it 's up to which may be the reinstatement Rustica talked a we have got the reinstatement trust coming nice I 'm down I was just really running on bullet point for just to understand what you mean exactly by a short what the funding for starting stage one is that mean that you 've got the money in the bank or is it just in a guarantee that say the fundraising is going to happen or what so the Senate resolution requires some of the funding to be guaranteed and it 's quite explicit and I think some of the other funding needs to be for short yes so there 's a combination of the two but essentially we have to be able to know that we can proceed with certainty and that the money will come that the money is there and if certain other monies will come for example we could take an estimate that they 'll be so the interest doesn 't necessarily guaranteed but as should but there are certain funds that need to be guaranteed and they include the government funding the crown funding etc yeah I think it 's just the still a big question mark over the fundraising for that 98 million shortfall sort of short form yep at mic 30 seconds what would be the consequence of the council not changing the timeframe from 10 years decision unless there was some other unexpected funds come in earlier there 's the potential that project the start of the project would be delayed it 's very helpful link thank you very much for your time

appreciators around a Wildlife Park is a Christchurch in Canterbury icon the reason we 're here today is quite obviously you 've read our submission we are asking that as a major community asset that we get recognized and the long-term plan for secured ongoing funding just to touch on what we 're about of course recreation we have been one of Canterbury 's leading recreational facilities for over 14 years now we 're an important contributor to economic growth and also the recovery of the region after fundraising very hard we bought the first girls to New Zealand in 2015 and critically endangered an iconic species that we 're privileged to hold and during that year alone 200,000 people came through our doors and over 55% of those were from Christchurch and came debris but of course we 're also encouraging people to come to our wonderful region and enjoy what we have to offer okay sorry just we monastic ministry of education through the learning experiences outside the classroom project and have done since the year 2000 our current contract goes through until 2020 we deliver formal education curriculum linked to over seventy seven thousand Canterbury children a year and what sets us apart is that these are whole day experiences to take away injuring learning outcomes we also have two partnerships with the warehouse and the Department of Conservation who both fund transport and other ancillary costs to enable were low decile schools to to visit so in the last year we 've had a lot of load of diesel schools through our doors due to those partnerships and of course conservation advocacy we educate every visitor that comes through the door with take-home messages such as keep your dog on a lead to protect Kiwi such as by sustainably when it comes to products with palm oil to save the rang attempts and also of course lightening your environmental footprint by recycling we 've just completed a major survey in April and 92% of our visitors plan to make a conscious effort to help the environment that they impact species in their environment with their decisions so we feel that that we really are getting through conservation of course I know that when people think of Arana that they often think lions and tigers and gorillas and our arena teams but it 's lesser-known often since the media doesn 't cover it the amount of amazing conservation work we do for New Zealand native species and the last few years 23 around a pretty we have been released to the wild over 60 Pheo have also been bred and released to the wild and we were initially part of the North Island Pheo breathing release program last year the Department of Conservation invited us to start a South Island bred for release program we read the first 13 South Island Pheo in captivity and all of those 13 have been successfully reared and breech to release to the West Coast already it 's not a matter of put two ducks together and break them our highly specialist Doug Pullman eggs were artificially incubation the ducklings are hatched reared and also taught how to behave in the pile of them to put out in the wild okay a keen party key another nationally threatened species and that 's another of our Arana team members out at a release to date we have read over a tea party key which have been released to the world various sites all over New Zealand and just last year Department of Conservation gave us a newfound appear from Great Barrier Island with new genetics so that plus such as our success in that area that we are engaging more a real big excitement as I 'm sure you all know about the orange front of parakeet that 's our Canterbury parrots and it 's nationally critical we were so privileged to be invited to join the program for the species in 2017 and you only get that if you are really performing because these guys are so intended to chicks and that 's a picture of one of the chicks that we 've read so far so we 're really excited about that it 's not just conservation helping to restore species and other places at aronia through native planting over we have over 25 New Zealand native species living and breeding in the grounds the rowing revolution the can debris spotted skank was rediscovered about ten years ago it was thought extinct some the since the 1980s Bellbird Breeden live in the park all year round internationally of course we are recognized for our contribution to exotic species efforts and I 'm not sure if many of you have heard in the media that recently we have signed a deal with the Australian Rhino project and the aim of that is to with two other major like zoos in Australia and partnership to create a really large population of southern white rhino in this part of the world the poaching rate is exceeding the birth rate and this rate of southern white poaching carries on they will be extinct by 2024 and so we are beaming together to help ensure that the southern doesn 't go the way of the northern white rhino which just happened a couple of months ago we lost the very last one in the world and you all know cheater giraffe etc research we also animals for instance we do trial bake tracks for care to make sure that they don 't bother them in them in the wild and a really thrilling thing is we are soon to receive one of the four critically endangered New Zealand frog species and our new captive breeding research facility which is close to completion all with funds raised from outside sources but this challenges in this modern world we 're at a situation we are we cease our budget annually on what we can afford rather than what we actually need we need to increase our staff levels current workloads are actually unsustainable and in fact done some of our team works so hard that you know burn out as a potential possibility with a zoo that we are operating which there 's world class with the work that we do we must recognize that we need really skilled professional staff being the most geographically isolated major zoo in the South Island of New Zealand our current wage structures are as such that we train our own professionals from scratch we find it very difficult to attract after five years of intensive training if you have a staff member head off to Australia where you static in gorillas and orangutans czar two of the most critically critically endangered species in the world and yeah we need to continue our professionalism and that means increased staff and there 's also increase compliance over the years of course there are new zoo regulations have come out we take our job very seriously operational costs increase all the time as well even the health and safety a number of years ago we would have one person the lone operating tiger and line reserves highly dangerous animals these are all a two-person operation now because we must operate at a highly professional level everyone deserves to come home safe from work every day and as a result that 's farthest reaches resources so essentially we 're employing imploringly the council to increase our operational funding to at least 500,000 per annum and include it in the long term plan rather than a supply annually to the streets and in communities fund given around us huge importance as a key community asset significantly support their major zoo and we 're very very grateful for the support we 've had through the streets and in communities fund over the years but we do ask that to help see Arana and performing at this level into the future that the council gets behind our drive by recognizing us thank you very much yes to David Barker our chairman of the board and yes we have come to the end of the team minutes so if you could just be really really brief I 'm gonna have to move on to the next sub matter our current expenditures 3.3 million dollars that 's what it costs us to run the pack we don 't feel that we can recover any more from attendees their charge and at all times the four dollars to come to our PAC we are in terms of being able to meet the demands of Health and Safety MPI all the other things have been talked about we do need support from the council there 's no time for questions I 'm really sorry but it 's yeah I mean we it sorry and we 're all tired unto the questions but I will say that there is a funding review working group that 's operating at the moment and one of the things that we are considering as the establishment of line item for nine items not the right word but proper partnership agreements with those essential characteristic Eric Duras to building features of our city so your submission ties and very nicely with that week so thank you very much thank you _"

day to day so I want to challenge you for the next few minutes I want to live in a city of the future one that recognizes the reality of climate change and creates policy designed to reduce our carbon footprint and environmental impact encourages of Fiera society with equal opportunity wherever possible I don 't want our city leaders to say the problems are too hard or for central government I want you to be explorers pushing those boundaries and I want you to be thieves stealing amazing policy from other cities around the world and challenging what is possible I want us to be at the forefront of local government politics have an energized our city with that we can be innovative in experimental not just in our public spaces but in our culture in politics I 'm proud that we 're targeting to become carbon neutral by 2030 but we can do more we should not be afraid to sit difficult goals for trying and failing is how we do more than we know we can the long term plan absolutely needs to include specific climate migration projects but beyond that we as a city should consider how we can leap from the front any efforts for climate change we are already powered by a hundred percent renewable energy we already have a car sharing scheme of a hundred electric cars what else can we do to push their envelope and lead the way to a sustainable future in considering a fuel tax I want to talk to you about what it means to incentivize change a fuel text isn 't just a way to gather funds but it 's also a way to solve other problems we need to consider the wider ramification these options a fuel tax needs but as a way to transition to desired outcomes fuel taxes can be a lever to reduce air pollution reduce congestion and sent the type of travel that is better for our city such as cycling public transport and electric vehicles people often mistake suggestions such as these as being a tax burden but I want to highlight how they can make us richer how I our entire country can benefit from forward thinking it 's clear that a fuel tax will help raise funds but you have to include in the discussion the requirements of funding better solutions and in sending the choice towards the speed of feature by understanding how we want our transport to be where we 'd be the place to transition there a local fuel tax must not unfairly affects lower income families we need our public transport to fight a genuine and viable transport choice and it should be a computer but options for the majority of our citizens this means that we need bus priority visions turn up and go frequencies and person passenger and memories we need to complete our cycling network vehicles over pedestrians and cyclists we 're lucky to have an electric car share scheme in the form of you go to aid private users who otherwise don 't need a car car sharing fills in those gaps not serviced by public transport we should look at how services like this can lessen the need for private vehicles and encourage the use of those and plan for them in our transport plans finally for those who aren 't serviced by the above we should encourage electric vehicle usage as the best means of transport to reduce our carbon emissions and improve our air quality here we can invest in public education charging infrastructure which I understand we 're already doing and encouraging adoption every council vehicle purchase should be easy first unless there 's an exceptional reason just like the current government policy when considering the entire pyramid of transport needs the following the the previous should be the specific actions that we take in concert with the fuel for the best outcome for all voting on this discussion a tax on carbon usage increasing landfill prices and encouraging local use bags will further enable us to transform from an unsustainable throwaway culture and reduce our environmental impact we can use these funds raised to incentivize better recycling efforts and reduce wastage an age where our water rights are under attacked with fresh potable waters increasing at risk and companies seek to profit from what has always been a public resource we must call for volume-based word pricing especially on water years for exploit somewhat of the way that Auckland does a water tax could be revenue-neutral but pay for our future water infrastructure needs particularly wastewater management and environmental restoration this requires legislative change but we must start the conversation now going on to transport in terms of transport commitments specifically we must reject the delayed completion of the Christchurch cycle routes and cyclone networks and affirm continued commitment to the 2020 to date of the previous LTP we must always choose pathways that will hastened towards our carbon neutral goals we need to spend the additional 19 million to a complete the cycle network and benefit from the urban cycle waste 50% plus a co-payment I 'm also we should also take advantage of the current political climate we are two of the three parties and government have campaigned on commuter rail in Christchurch if we don 't start this conversation conversation now then we run the risk of missing out on these campaign promises and so I ask you to get that conversation started as well we should continue supporting schemes such as you go share in Nick 's bike who provide excellent transport options for the public I can mean to the council on the uptake of electric vehicle cashier scheme and a reduction of the council 's fossil fuel fleet and I urge the council to continue to fund electric vehicle infrastructure and conversion of the council and associated entities because to electric alternatives I applaud the pedestrianisation of our city center with laneways and the 30k zone and ask for a continual focus on pedestrian comfort accessibility and safety going forward finally regarding facilities I question the wisdom of spending big on a football stadium I feel like there are more important funding needs for 250 million and I 've hoped that any decision any case that should absolutely be below the priority of reducing our contribution to climate change and giving our city a bit of transfer options I 'm not here today to tell you anything that you don 't already know but just to add to the chorus for a bit of future thank you thank you very much I was actually thinking yeah round of applause since there 's no one else here got you the record we 'll give you the round of applause but I was thinking about your submission when I was reading I 'm on a citilab email and they sent me Atlanta you know sort of news articles and things like this but they 're running a series at the moment about about bus and they use Seattle which is our sister city and it 's why I was thinking of you this morning because they had gone that they 've increased their population since 2007 by 15% downtown private vehicle usage has declined by 10 percent in the same period and that 's because they 've really invested in their bus network and and 's a vicious cycle with cuts to schedules and routes and then that leads to declining bus ride at met ridership feeds the narrative that trends it as a waste of money more people take to their cars and overs traffic gets worse and the buses run slower repeat yeah so you know that 's why I was thinking about you this morning when I was reading this article so thank you very much for your submission and I think we 'll end the day with a round of applause to you [Applause] yeah I had a bit more time too could you email it through that would be really useful thank you I 'm sure it will be quoted an and some of the debates that we 've here yeah thank you thank you very much you know that the PowerPoint is there all right so thank you everyone and it has a Saturday afternoon I 'm going to let you go did you have something urgent that you needed to say so next time we vote on a parent 's going in around okay so I shall adjourn p.m. thank you _"

    "text": "take your tape or why are you signing Mortlock better mayor councillors Steve tutor Ichiro there to kill your evil over to Ricky Nicholas oh sorry director of the company I must 've written come me my fella he representing the real I got this bit that needs a way through we have got a presentation which basically yep what we 're looking at here in the first slide is composition Romania and Turkey have over many years I stored as you know the canal for lately it was brought me decide to commit to manage the loan of the lake to prevent flooding there 's also done primarily also for improving the health of the lake those two objectives and having constructed the canal it is now used by the council exclusively for lively flood the waters of the lake prevent flooding the RMA the hearing was held in which consent was given to the killer will be extended out his life of the canal be extended out 35 years the part of that consent process required the construction of a bridge praxis across the beach there 's and basically the council 's endowment fund I 've got two endowment funds have been funding the opening closing in the opening and closing of the lake and in this case they 've doubled phones also funded 200,000 towards the construction of the bridge and the Runanga into katie funded hundred fifty thousand dollars and there was a shortfall of about one hundred sixty eight thousand dollars which was required to be funded but the parties had not reached agreement on how its to be funded now the endowment funds which council had been lied upon land upon to pay the the way to do for this purpose wasn 't sufficient to meet their digital cost and so it was a case of good looking now to council and saying well you know the writing is done that 's bit funded probably a million dollars worth of expenditure I 'll be like opening and Lake and providing the canal and providing monies for the bridge and now it 's council that 's had a free ride put crudely up to now they haven 't used the thermic fund which was established the opening closing late so we 're asking for one-off small donation and council to the Darwin fund so the endowment fund can pay the bulk of the capital costs of that bridge ongoing monitoring and maintenance basically the weekends consent required is quite significant number of monitoring programs looking at the health of the leg it was the question of maintenance to the bridge the engineering requirements to ensure that it was safe to operate and these are ongoing obligations and that was imposed upon the Runanga o or to kitty in this particular sense because they were to be the owner of the bridge yeah basically council said we don 't want on the bridge we won 't be relying on the bridge that 's very generous in something it 's very used by the public and it was designed for the public and so we would say well why should the rinoa and to kitty have this ongoing obligation going forward but what a CCE is a community asset so we 're looking to Council to provide probably only between 10 2015 maybe makes 20,000 getting to required because basically the whole purpose of this canal was to lower the cost of opening it closely like they had a number of engines you could open the like and close it very quickly effectively without having to dig around the whole beach the second thing is the disturb the landscape it certainly it was reefs it was the safe way of opening closing the night and finally cost most important award it was improving health the lake in you there 's been a report being done for council and free can showing that consequences of the since 2009 the trophic level index preachers and I 'm and it doesn 't really show that graphic covers here because it it 's a straight line the graph averaged out over there since 2006 2003 to the present day but the reality is was that since the lake was openly close by canal through you through the canal the house is like is improved substantially so what makes me resolve to one extent each party shares the cost of the bridge we are simply say 950,000 it providing for the bridge it should only be required to provide them our monies we looked at concept for toll for the bridge they didn 't find favor with the like resonance although I think it would have been a fair process to have done and say well and I think residents won 't pay for it we think the council should support the adult front to do so and who should monitor maintain ensure the building of the of the bridge and we gained we looked at council then down from till now but what we should mostly celebrate is the success of council they 're not working together and I 've got to say that the staff that we done was the council is superb and I won 't_''_322.03 I will name one person because he 's lengthy process with council over many many years there 's crime Harrington he 's been a delight to work with work with and we know that he 's done his best for the project and he supports what we 're doing but there 's no issues at all in that regard but what the result mind now Bonita is going to talk about Tiago by mention plane or the consequence of that thank you just curious is anybody you 've been to these areas so during summer months in particular you would know that it 's a very popular place in we get hundred literally hundreds of visitors to the area so we the council first put in the year half the public path they put it sorry they put it to you our left originally they put the pathway in their way which was sorry can see the arrow no okay it 's your right it 's my right on the right side and unfortunately along near is very important why heat up his site son they and they were totally unaware that when they put the public pathway through that area which means that not only and it was there lot of foot traffic beer there was a lot of rubbish in a lot of people were going to the oddity because there 's no toilet facilities and they bang and so the Runa know at their own cost put in and shifted road on the left side and put in a much better steer stairway you know to access in and it won in at the other end and so I really wanted to highlight the fact that we we shifted it over to petite that weight up aside and so what we 're seeking from the Sioux Council as is in partnership with you is to look at firstly building a better park a car park because at the moment there isn 't it 's really insufficient space and so we 'd like that he reads to be cleared preferably flattened in with some shingle down that would be that would make that agree so much more so far and also to put an erect a toilet both it tumble down in it being and bein so those that 's really what we 're asking for and as you can see there 's already being a membrane standing dragon drive form presented it was awaiting a response delete good idea to the carpark repose is on Redang Island so innocently reserved the professor 's files will be away from the public reserve new backpack with a kid park going into the so this is basically up to their public have been driving on to this I went to kitty lab their parking me vehicles there there 's a lot of very sense actually situation to give it at all so we with the pathway out of sorry I 'm trying got the road incoming from Christchurch towards the the reserve yes it 's difficult without a pointer so that nation Matthews right so that was really original with it original we should 've over to you the path I mean I think it 's here yeah the existing Erie is we people pack right you have to take so that 's the roadway coming on Roberts we 're the parking with the arrows okay and you want you want a sort of some agreeable part pop there well it 's it is required because what happened was the council had a slip on its on the reserved and very brightly as a result a certain want to get rid of the water so directed the water from the slip onto the was CCA a reasonably dry field panic into a very wet attic right and and it 's basically creating problem for a self okay alright well got 19 seconds Andrew thank you and thanks for presentation to questions so I 'm just the site for the car park or the proposed site for the car park that 's on running island rather than council land Oh silly yeah okay and the tumbledown Bay toilets of the tunnel down by making it they towards I had some involvement in this a few months ago and I understood that there was a reasonably good quality conversation going on between our Rangers and the runing around the possible sighting of toilets and the ability to potentially do that within reprioritizing some existing budgets my thinking was there was a conversation going on about us providing the toilets and the running and providing some ongoing maintenance to those toilets has that conversation conversation stalled because we understand that the reserve management plan hasn 't been being deferred in terms of committing it we did conscious with Christmas coming but a blunder you don 't people going to the beach it tumble down by in particular and and and basically have nowhere to go to the toilet and that 's exactly what has been happening that 's the thing that we need to work together to avoid all right well let 's see whether we can pick up the toilet conversation outside of the reserve management plan conversation anyway given the urgency yeah okay I mean that may be a conversation we can pursue rather than this needing to be an LTP matter but we can certainly look into it as part of LTP consider thank you very much thank you it 's wonderful thank you very much for going to all of that trouble and for coming over for the actual hearing itself and thank you good to see you again _"

    "text": "take 30 Rome outer trust Jamie Stephenson injili snap welcome thank you for this opportunity of speaking our submission is in two parts we don 't get a presentation we might if you 're lucky do a song and dance so hopefully here we go um we here really to talk to briefly to some of the things than the proposed long term plan but more particularly to talk about some of the proposals which are starting to take shape in the council supportive community lead revitalization plan of the inner city ace which Jamie my colleague will talk some more about but we want to begin by saying that we acknowledge and recognize the difficult context that you are working on and being able to develop the long term plan especially as you seek to try and get a balance between the post-quake recovery and regeneration while maintaining your services and planning for growth which is set against the need for financial prudence as well as the challenges that are faced by climate change in the need for a seat renewal so quickly our people so we support the that 's needed being done and we acknowledge that they 'd includes subsidies cooperation and joint features which you Mia have indicated in other ways of raising Vignon but in a way that recognizes growing hardship and the need to keep rates affordable we also particularly encourage you to secure a fairer more just cost your agreement with central government when this comes up for renewal later this year and particularly in negotiation we luckily refer to the metro sports facility and the monty youth arena given the cute huge capital outlay for these projects we believe that the water and its related infrastructure needs to be given high priority and that wastewater needs to be equally prioritized alongside having safe drinking water flood protection work and the necessary stormwater infrastructure we actually encourage considering imposing consequences for non-compliance we very much support the proposed transport strategy and the need to shift the emphasis away from roads and motorways to accommodate residential expansion of the city outskirts and we particularly encouraged to think about and seen tough to see work opportunities being created closer to where people 11 we acknowledge you to actively work towards returning your rental housing stop to pre quake levels we recognize that this is going to require it require you to reprioritize the community facilities program so that projects such as the multi-use arena and the New Brighton hot pools and your smart cities innovation programs may be a given a lower priority rating coming from an area which is awash with alcohol outlets and a marginalised area we strongly support hi it 's cool to put an additional special rating on bottle stores in other off licenses in order to increase the cost of cheap out alcohol or mitigating the cost of alcohol harm I 'm now going to hand over to Jamie to the revitalisation thank you and thank you again to the council so since the council resolution last year to support the community led revitalization plan process they voted or Martha and council staff have been working together with the community to identify and prioritize the hopes strengths and concerns of the inner city east and Lynwood area while this process has not yet reached a point of yielding a list that the community would like to see responses to and some of these are issues that were relevant even before the earthquakes so we are however aware that after this round of long-term planning it will be harder to allocate allocate council funds to these sort of initiatives so we 've proposed a range of actions that come out of these community conversations so we feel confident that they will have widespread support in the community the first of these is improvements to dorsal us Reserve which has been identified by many as an important community gathering place but has also been identified over time by locals as being nondescript and a strong connection has been made between clarifying the purpose of the park and maintaining it as a safe place the second proposal is a review of the design of the Inner City East Linwood leg of the Rapa Nui shag rock cycle way many locals have had concerns about the design of the cycleway especially as it concerns safety and the effect on businesses particularly in Stanmore Road and Worcester Street in an area that 's still recovering scheme for the area rubbish has been a strongly identified concern amongst a cross-section of the community and with a unique makeup of the area with about 75 to 80 percent renters many on low incomes large rubbish is of particular concern so we would support a scheme being piloted as a community-based pre-employment program in the entity 's Lynnwood the fourth is a review of residential planning guidelines for the area some residents have talked about preserving the unique character traditions and amenity of the area while others talked about the negative consequences of intensification of housing we are aware that these guidelines fall into the district plan and we would support a return of district planning powers to Christchurch City Council at such time we would support a review of guidelines to make sure that rules in place protect what 's important to our community the final proposal is a purchase of land for community hub many community members have talked about missing access to lost services and essential shops such as chemists banks and green grocers we are aware that the market hasn 't provided replacements to can make it difficult for new businesses to start up particularly in the area serving low-income population so we 're proposing a community hub one that meets local needs and enables the return of services in a viable way a place to act as an incubator for new businesses and to develop the neighborhood economy through such initiatives as neighborhood co-ops and social enterprises we see this as a place to fulfill community hopes for more places to gather and spend time together and places to build on and sustain an existing community initiatives that people really value so in closing we see these proposals as a start to addressing community hopes that have come out of the revitalization plan process at this stage and we also see ample opportunities for community to play a key role in shaping the implementation of these thank you okay um look there 's so many people in three minutes so it will start with deal thanks for the presentation and thanks for the work you 're doing on the revitalization strategy for Lynwood Village do you know do you have any idea when and we 're interested to hear that Little River is taken four years to get so we 're not even a year and they eat and but it 's been very important to engage the local members and bring them on board particularly given it 's a marginalized area and people don 't_''_486.55 often participate the ability to be able to be engaged and just one other thing in in your written submission you talked about supporting the regional say local fuel tax I mean that 's a regressive tax and it 'll obviously impact on lower socioeconomic you know communities they don 't efficient vehicles and stuff like there 's any otherwise we can sort of have to start those conversations I mean yeah I mean it 's good but it 's not gonna happen overnight yeah yeah yeah thank you actually my question follows on really nicely you talked about there the cycleway and the fees and the concerns of the businesses and with actually a lot of people in the area not owning cars do you think councils doing enough to encourage and enable cycle uptake in walking form of transport for many of these people and you 're helping groups like icicles and people get bikes and lights and helmets and things would probably help quite a lot in that area and then probably have the businesses would that help well I think us is part of funny it 's doing I think a really important service but use this more that can be done for sure around it and whether there 's the ability to work in partnership I mean one of the difficulties is making sure we 've got a good supply of good bikes and that we can you know able to be able to to do the math so they 're in good working and they 're passing on a part of recycling the US yeah many of the shops in the area mmm many of the customers don 't own cars anymore a time so actually being able to help with it you know like we 're not takin you 're getting people to those businesses would help well that 's really come to the end of this at the submission as an approach that we adopted and I don 't know a number of years ago and that was to actually bring all of the community board bring I was the local Member of Parliament at the time there 's a whole group of us got everyone together work with the community and we did our own and organic collection and we had an agreement through the community board with the City Council for free dump fees in order to take all of the stuff we took tons and tons almost broke my bag but it was really effective and I think if it was done once a year it would make a real difference and I would really recommend you reach out to the student volunteer army people like that they 're always looking for projects like that that would actually enable university to university but a suburb to break the back of what is often years of backyard collections as people change rentals they leave the rubbish behind so it would be it would make a huge difference so I just recommend that to you as an approach fees okay thank you very much _"

one of brixon chair of the Little River Railway trust also I must include behind me this is Vanessa Mitchell who is vice chair of the Little River trust for the moment also Georgia Mitchell her supporter who is a representative for the playground committee also Craig Roberts treasurer and my personal supporter jr. virtue and goodness Dobson trust me as I speak there are still eight series of slides which are coming up on the wall it is fitting the key points of our submission we before and after shots which would illustrate reminders of the submissions content council has the trust submission counselors will having to hand and in all probability the architect design concept village plan has already been observed he 's available for public scrutiny it is not my intention to proceed item by item through the submission document but it must be noted that this is the outcome of trust and its supporters in the past year alone I calculated 7,200 hours of community effort has gone into producing the ideas that rest with or castle as you will see the settlement and state high 75 need to have the pre-existing drainage network and checkpoints attended to swales would be of great value to ensure this but also to protect the integrity of Toledo or whitey WA which is of great cultural national and local and environmental importance the streetscape to provide safety for pedestrians and vehicles the village also needs a recreation park complex a park playground for children when people stop in Little River there 's very little in the way of amenity for young people the historic and unique Venice heritage buildings are requested to be revitalized you see our coronation library layer it 's looking very sad at the moment however I know that the little work has been done to seal the roof and that is appreciated this entails further work which will free up traffic management walkways and finally a modern wastewater system this can happen if the flooding within and about the the settlers that came to the area control the flooding and all these other things can fall into place our submission is a direct outcome of a Little River Big Ideas document that distilled the essence of the community 's concerns of the past years up to the present these concerns are the framework with which we work that this submission is supported by the wider Runanga the RET reserve management board the Little River Railway trust the banks peninsula community board the bank minute award his own committee all observe a commonality of interest in diverse areas the trust has formed a strong good solid administrative structure it is professional it is energetic and the people are enthusiastic they have asked me to ask you this provide us with the resources and we will be glad to work in partnership with CCC to revitalize it our River then get the job done I thank the mayor deputy mayor councillors and staff for your assistance with announcement on this submission kanui 10a I could be he knew a key aqua leave time for you to ask many questions of us bit like give us the tourism will do the job with us I just want to ask you about one of your slides the one with the track has gone into the Dutch you 've got a comment to a bed assisting slowing traffic speeds through the village we were at the Y we will mirai on Waitangi day and the speed of traffic further down the road seemed pretty horrendous was wondering in fact a few it 's a community group have concerns about that and the possibility of extending the slower speed limit out to it perhaps a bit further than them are I yes answer a Simon and we are very cognizant of them arise concerns in this regard particularly for example we are so culturally net when they 're having a Tony traffic is going past that Mariah hundred colleges but there are also pedestrians who wish to walk from kun town to Little River so this is a matter of great concern we have through the Little River love Little River boo many to get the traffic speed down but Jenny would be able to program that we are looking at you know speak for a turn yes our traffic management program at the moment only covers the part that 's covered by the 60 kilometers an hour but then our Little River Big Ideas the community asked us to reduce the speed right up to the Mirai and perhaps even through as far as coupe town which is 7 thank you very much thank you any questions Vikki I didn 't I 'm not sure if I heard you properly are you asking what happened we estimate it to be between five and several million dollars at the moment we believe that the most important aspect is to get the flooding under control that will clear state highway 75 that will allow Little River to go ahead with securing its amenities and maintaining its viability and probably one of the key elements of that is part of the streetscape design in the plan which the middle river village planning committee put together thank you thank you any other questions yonni thank you just we had an another submission earlier with showing the domain and so can you just help us understand kind of what 's being done to address the flooding current way and what the gap is in terms of having it addressed yes currently the front mitigation environment has been handled by a care shed and the O 'Connor river and a reating district was struck for that the community contributed towards it over the last three years that work has progressed well and I understand that they have some final work still to be done for the remainder of this year in the vicinity of the hour et demain and the coronation library the Econo River builds up very rapidly and that is a flood area the flooding comes from folks behind Little River and the drains which have not been cleared over a long period of time many of which are on private land I hasten to add some of which are part of the council responsibility but all of them are currently inadequate they were built in about the 19th century I think many of them they have been kept there but they need to be developed and brought one of the choke points which distributes water and directs water into Little River but nothing has been done on the economy over at the moment I understand they would like to build it over bond the height of the Bund is limited by the height of the bridge behind they would also like to put gabion Zee to protect it so the river doesn 't wash away and take away a bridge so there people are thinking about thank you thank you very much so I 'll just it would like to say that you are the kind of living breathing example of the sort of thing behind the GSL teepee which has we 're in it together and it 's the idea that we work in partnership we can achieve so much more than people who just come and say to the council come and do this for us this is a invitation to come and do this with us and it 's really appreciated Little River Big Ideas I love it thank you _"

    "text": "right the living Memorial Trust Matthew Rosenman great well thank you for the opportunity to talk to the council just talking to the issues around the auto guy keno reserve which is at the e-tron 's to Christchurch has been described as sort of one of Christ chutes best kept secrets don 't hand me in the room you 've been to ultra Baikonur mm-hmm great well one of the issue is with the auto guy Kino as well one of the great things about was the new crush it Northern Corridor is that it 'll be positioned at the entrance to Christchurch as a natural wetland feature and we 're trying to do everything we can was to make it a real good sort of entrance picture good slide please okay so just a feeling that auto park a no-reserve is a Department of Conservation Reserve being restored it in partnership with the living room trust the Memorial Trust since 1982 so and it it 's one of the few remaining wetlands that were once common in Christchurch an area of cultural significance and ecological values in all the a neighboring farm no expert outside rivers Hall and it 's apart from the storm water system coming from Belfast so it 's a blend of private enterprise with lemon Halen Hayward and Department of Conservation it can in community groups over the last 25 years so it 's quite unique in that it 's not a burden on the Christchurch City Council ratepayers and it 's an excellent model of how you develop facilities for people for the Christchurch people without bit burdens routes and it 's just a peaceful peaceful place to take a walk around we 're currently doing that upgrade with its damage would be quite afraid at the moment funded by Wellington dock and which will see a new bridge and walking track in real order to the public in October as a as a key destination with with NZTA we did a lot in the submission and negotiations with the well officially with wisdom Belfast bypass and we were able to get them to bloom they 're planted actually on the embankment and also they extended their Whitley and seen out beyond between the they had proposed scheme even we planning the pine trees from the fanfare and we 're able to get them to change those to Totoro so we were able to influence on the designer that motorway that at least it blended in and with the the new crush at Northern Corridor we were able to get that shift at eight meters away from the reserve this is what I 'm reading him to us been able to work with big organizations and planning people really honest results and what we 're able to do there that that Chinese on-ramp at the moment that temporary on-ramp Road the only reason that came about is that we went to them and decided in pointed out we were landlocked if they put that road hard up against that gave us they made a concession to ship the motorway 8 meter and put in a gravel track and then they decided that that was an ideal cost-effective way to put the temporary road and so when they finish their that road will become a neset and it actually gives its nesic port department conservation for the Christchurch City crews here the stormwater system from Belfast close out the india and it 's a it 's a gives access to it so all of this has been able to look at the bigger picture with these people being able to negotiate and come up with a real good win-win situation so we 've got to consider gravel track we 've got a couple hundred thousand dollar road so we 've got the motorways progressing in a line so what 's next mark time to look at the belfast stormwater treatment facility which is in something that we 're very keen on and also linking this new equation was in corridor with with the cycleway was their area the untreated stormwater from Belfast is it significant issue to the wetland it 's the only city done to go through I mean for sort of pristine with me and that 's the only issue that 's sort of holding us back and we need a collective approach to the wider area and just was to two main issues the belfast stormwater treatment an integrated transport planning so Belfast plan in the longer term with those blues squeeze at the top is the proposed storm of treatment ponds and that 's a looked what I mean there 's some looks in isolation whereas if you look at this visual of approaching christchurch from the north with autoplay key node you 've got the motorway plantings which were built on the end up with this Wales maple all the same Whitley and theme and now we 've got the opportunity in within the longer-term plan to develop wetlands that will okay to serve a function in terms of quality but I 'll serve an enormous visual functions and also it starts building this landscape that would be quite incredible isn 't a proper northern approach to Christchurch and the other potential there is as a car park at the moment on that these sheer cycle paths along a new motorway finishes just at the main North Road their overpass at Otto kokino or at the just pass the kokino and there 's its motorway land at the moment and unfortunately this wasn 't that would have been a great motorway playing it was a good lead from Council that you could rather than epic with it area is designated motorway land that would come service at the end but rather than step up the cycleway finish near one I have a a form carpark yeah we 're not asking the council to put a million dollars for a car park what were suggesting is go Council go collectively to to the central question or horrible alliance and start working here you could do it well they 've got all the machinery their own things and you could get that formed you know it could still be probably to put it in but my brain doesn 't do this very well is that South at the top yes yes sir okay sorry looking up you 're looking yes no I 'm with you now yeah yeah yeah thank you and with it the new motorway there 's an over bridge over the main North Road is pedestrian access under the bridge which would lead and also it 's an ideal place if you 're gonna have a cycleway ship you you have heaven facility where people can park the cars or bike and ride catch a bus at the outskirts of Christchurch but also given in mind the Stormwind of treatment things what about Kira would like to be able to grow with these may be opportunities within the stormwater to incorporate native plantings and conservation years so got this potential develop a really neat entrance to Christchurch and all of this has just been able to look at the big picture I 'm working with yeah it 's not you know it 's not lots of money and so to summarise in the stormwater treatment facility is sort of critical for the restoration of wetland and there is a need their collective planning with water and transport for this area to have the best possible final result okay any questions though David thank you very much miss you just like your food to the potential car pack site for Blake and ride you know just wondered would that would it also be potential for Park and Ride for a bus service as well yes that 's to work very you yeah yep David thank you that 's the first time I 've seen that particular plan and what concerns me probably links into the previous subdivision do you have any idea where the proposed stormwater retention ponds for belfast to discharge they do discharge to the kaepa Tony or they not in the South Branch they state they discharge that comes really reserved into the South Branch we yeah possibly if these retention ponds are proposed and to be built they could be of some assistance to removing some of the stormwater discharge that 's currently coming from Belfast to the capitana Creek and exacerbating river levels and the lower catchments I 'd certainly sort of like to promote this particular floodwater stormwater retention basins that certainly is advantageous for the Artic I know reserved and potentially for the lower stakes catchment as well yeah it 's that look that 's great it 's a very good submission and thank you for the taking the time it 's always great to have these PowerPoint presentations as well just really gives a graphic image of what can be achieved thank you okay we _"

other names have been crossed out so sorry the submissions represented use of the community represented members of the Stix happy new it in this coastal forward community the community representatives endorsed the Joint Working Party submission in Pat we know that the mebiner II in the spirit Coast will support the resolutions and the joint submission but notes that will be subject to the land drainage staff determining the timing timing of the works within their project prioritization we know that the application of the guidance criteria to determine the long-term plan outcomes including the capital program and projects and funding within it is not set by CCC staff but a set variously at council executive level and by elected members and over lamented only by councils mmm I 've been following the submissions on the live stream and this happening to hear the individuals and community groups or an organization speaking upon issues recovery to community and individual regeneration unfortunately this is not so for our Lois that 's small settlement communities the CCC has no targeted strategy for regeneration or area plan for one of the hardest hit areas from the natural disaster events almost eight years past the natural disaster the Christchurch City Council stays in the Christchurch City Council 30 year infrastructure strategy 2018 in 2048 they are still to make decisions about the funding timing and scope of the regeneration projects taking into account all the other work that needs to be undertaken across the city we understand that 's the restraints of the budget but we representatives of as asked about prioritizing for capital works funding to meet the CCC statutory obligations the levels of service to provide flood protection and storm storm water management in a sustainable manner our customer expectations have not been met in this long-term plan I think I had some photographs thank you the council 's for community outcomes strong communities livable city help the environment prosperous economy the four overarching issues affecting the council 's infrastructure of ESSEC renewals climate change post last attachment needs a coordinated works program

earthquake events the sticks stormwater management long-term plan funding as allocated to provide for growth the stormwater management plan aims to maintain and improve the six values for waterways without investment and storm water treatment the water quality will continue to degrade as further land use and interpretation takes place the sticks catchment is identified as the highest growth area for the duration of this long term plan the Canterbury Regional decision 26th of June 2013 was sought to implement the sticks SNP with the consent CR c13149 the sticks stormwater management plan was informed by the Belfast area plan the sticks catchment Belfast area plan 2010 identifies this growth but was not informed by an area plan for the receiving environment for lower stakes and yet our brought away the lowest sticks River services one-third of the city 's stormwater jack discharge the council option 1 provides stormwater management the upper reaches of the catchment to provide for growth there is no funding for the lowest sticks receiving environment our priority and expectation is that the costs need to be spread evenly between cost benefits and contribution to the mitigation of of effects in the receiving environment the growth areas benefits but the receiving environment where the effects have felt and degenerating the funding priorities are not fairly distributed neither is the timing of works allocated for funding there is real concern in the lowest Lex communities we are watching our areas disrespected deteriorated and disregarded as earthquake flood issues a worsening and yet these photo shoots an earthquake effects have been identified and acknowledged the sticks earthquake effects G Graham Harrington and Tom Parsons informed part of our report and showed that those effects were identified as own is 2012 there is intense frustration in the community on the basis that the council seemed to be not addressing flooding issues the council may be reviewing the condition strategy sets but residents perceive that the CCC do not appear to be adequately reviewing the performance of the drainage assets of the river reduced its capacity to handle stormwater but the council it can and others are going in with developments which further exacerbate the planning situation for even for residents residents believe that developments such development should not be permitted until the current drainage flooding situation is fully understood and the rights of existing residents protected development has increased flooding on land adjacent and near to developments by reducing the area and the catchment available for ponding and so pitch speeding up runoff will run off of the overload and damaged drainage system closing on farm drains which is effectively training existing and nearby properties so that the stormwater ama around the properties now ponds on these properties damaging waterways utility assets so they no longer function effectively area areas around the state some effects have been designated newly flooded after site areas around the lowest six have been newly designated as flood ponding areas but the residents have not been adequately consulted upon this but therefore appears of the Three Rivers residents are being expected to put up with more flood ponding on their land in order to lack of earthquake remediate remediation to banks riverbed and also there is no acknowledgement of the Brooklands lagoon inundation in the southern end residents feel that their land is being sacrificed for urban development to the extent that there is a feeling that the CCC is deliberately letting residents properties get flooded so residents will leave sell their properties to the CCC so that the CCC can you the landfill flat ponding despite this lack of performance of information on drainage assets these organizations have put the pursuit at Michoud building and resource consents for new developments developments using these consents are now causing increased flooding from neighboring properties but the council II can and developers appear and willing to take responsibility for this new cloning developer contributions for new land-use consents are not reflected in the long-term budget plan budget these contributions appear to be absorbed and lost in the central pool of plants there is no contribution to the receiving environment the contribution appears to have been designated the predominantly to the contribution appears to have been to designate the predominantly rural land and rural residential properties and application of responsibility to mitigate the increased risk in the fix both of development and earthquake took place it 's almost a token gesture towards operational activities to placate and miss play cricket residents from past decades of inaction of maintenance upon the river is to put forward and there is no funding for earthquake damage effects or flood issues homes have been identified as as more vulnerable to flooding than the Gea to report 2014 we secured funding to protect the homes consequences of increasing flood result can result in social health and safety and economic effects in the community their flood risks acquired post earthquake noodles is not addressed and this will result of damage to houses businesses rural businesses infrastructure increased cleanup costs psychological impacts upon people directly affected it will also have several indirect impacts including and reduce the economic activity and increase in insurance costs stresses on public health system delays and access through emergency response and social degradation for repeated flooding we need confidence in our homes communities and small settlements and facilities and environment are protected from the cumulative effects of the exacerbated than the upper catchment and from damaged two rivers beds lateral spread and change it to properly from the earthquakes earthquakes post-quake land zoning decisions affecting area must have reduced the infrastructure road in wastewater management and renewal costs to the council give back to our lower set of catchments for that sacrifice our area gave give back the Local Government Act requires the water supply wastewater stormwater flood protection and control works roads and footpaths that are included in the infrastructure strategy the council business and says opportunity for all not opportunity for some not winners and losers effective management of stormwater runoff reduces the risk of flooding reduces the impact of stormwater on the receiving environment a well performing stormwater drainage network contributes to a multiple values such as ecology recreation culture heritage and landscape it is an also important part of developing resilience to hazards and climate change stressors for stormwater drainage network is provided and maintained to collect or remove stormwater protecting the community from surface flooding during storm events a healthy waterway is we need high priority enhancement of the lowest x catchment natural environment developed alongside growth in the upper catchment there 's no clarity about how the costs of information will be allocated when will counsel make some significant decisions regarding funding timing and scope of regeneration projects and the lower stakes beyond what is already approved how can we accelerate this process through the capital funding the long-term plan 2018 28 service plan for the flood protection of control works as at March 2018 States the citywide stormwater model validated by floor level surveys has been used to better define the extent of the flood risk and well informed long-term sustainable decision-making the community represents us on the working party have continually continually asked for the updated citywide stormwater model but we have been told it 's not available clearly it is the facilitator appointed by the council to assist residents complied a list of tens questions raised by the representative members these have not been answers I 've asked a series of questions for validation on the floor level surveys used to determine the extent of the flood risk but these have not been answered since October 2016 we have appreciated being upon the working party and we realize the constraints just as a final perk law relation the Christchurch central Brooklands playing a harbor Basin sorry the infrastructure strategy page 60 states that and why do a water supply isn 't currently being secured groundwater supplies thank you do any of the others want to speak as well okay it 's pretty well recognized that the Styx River is up to full capacity with that even I don 't know how you can dispute that with it flooding the last 12 months even the height of summer through the drought it wasn 't retaining within its banks and under the drainage board act it states that you cannot put any more subdivision into a river if it cannot handle that and the statistics catchment has designated to be the highest growth of any catchment in the areas of the city it was told to us by the your engineers so if you 're gonna put all this extra subdivisions into this catchment why are you not doing anything to the last Styx River it 's not legal you cannot do because what you 're doing now has it doesn 't comply with the-- with your the storm would have consent from lead he cane was up in 2017 as far as I know and it 's been put off and put off and put off because they know they can 't comply so they 're putting more and more subdivision because they know that they comply yeah so why it 's still hidden you still have a nikkie gone for that concede and if you don 't get that can sink you will not be on it but one more thing into the Styx River and all these subdivisions are certainly it will not be able to go into it so it 's in your own interest to spend some money into the sticks to get it up so I can hold the capacity of the waters it 's going to fly with these subdivisions after the earthquake there 's lots of electric spreading there 's cracks and the stalks hitting the air up to your waist and all that all that soil is moving into the river now not that out at the moment but as soon as that gets into the river it 's going to be a huge cost of removing that so the longer this is put off it 's going to cost the council more and more and more money to be like 10 or 100 times what it 's going to cost to do in the future to what its gonna do now with with him the highest growth in our area we we should have some of that money I mean just an the priests and subdivisions I think there 's five hundred billion spent Thea we never got one seem to woods there a lot of catchment of the Styx River we 've suckin all the fits all that money is taken over spent on the hip get a even if you 're asked nothing of speed on us if we once do that the catchment we should give one-third of the money we 're not we getting a trickle of the money it took me to it to their size of our catchment and to the size of the people we not fear if we were just kidding if we had a pond through the budget this we can actually maintain that river and and do enough works to to make it handle the flow of the water but it has not handing the flow of the water there there 's been various reports and all these reports I think such reports all these reports say the same thing the same event midpoint is saying about you don 't have to widen saying the river that to fall capacity why I mean is why are they getting all these reports costing hundreds of thousand dollars and then the engineers are just disobeying that information and not doing one thing the reports say if they do report sure if you 're going to spend that money you should do what the report says it was a waste of time you know even recently we 've had the situation on the last opus report where they love meted all the nude points which is the narrowing a lot of the narrowing points which are the main ones that are affecting the greatest and done who has done a wonderful instead of running dandy being very simple thing taking them back decided they were gonna put on a big shower just dig it out just at a just beautiful dia that wasn 't done for the flower the river it was done for public opinion it 's to me the whole thing seems a waste of time we 've had the working committee there we 've spent a lot of time and the idea of that work was to get a budget in for this so we didn 't have to put a submission for this and it was never done we had no budget allowed for us for the whole time is the budget for the for the I even a budget for the Heathkit four major developments worth quite reiteration there 's a plane for the I even there 's a plane for he 's getting there 's no plan for the sticks here can you not have a plane it 's just it just doesn 't make sense I mean there 's no disputing if you put a subdivision into a if there 's holding pond work to 100% there only work to 125 100 50 flood when it 's over there event that will let water get stuck straight into the river now in the priestess subdivision those holding ponds don 't even hold a one-in-ten flat I 've got photos sitting there if you want them I 've got the Sydney showing it flowing over their holding pond in a one and eight year flood run an 8 year event and that 's with not one house in the subdivision so when those houses are going in there which they are now that 's probably going to hold a 105 year flood that 's what they 're holding capacity is on there I mean there is answers to this as answers now they there 's a lot of water could be re re diverted ever kept a Tony or with the northern either Tyrael coming through you could run a drain down for the northern are too straight to the Y Mac this is the drain you know the freezing works pipeline some of that could be utilized and streams and creeks that could be reverted into the Y Mac and not I mean here in the paper it says the bail faster double in size that water 's going to come down to us and this it 's Reed averted into the Y Mac that 's coming straight down to us in a river that 's over capacity we are now he gonna receive water from the flopped and basin we never had before why are we being sacrificed why we seek and we feel like we 're second-class citizens want our money for air subdivisions which is the Council of course this it 's the council problem it 's nuts not as you 're making us suffer for the money you are receiving into subdivisions and it 's a great deal of money you know points subdivision five hundred million dollars it 's a lot of money in this there 's it 's like a tipping point this there 's so many more industrial subdivisions all up the planned all up the track and they 're all gonna come into the sticks River and in five or be flooding people yeah and the potential for danger is huge I mean I 've I 've actually had to pull out cars over that River and it 's been over the top of the the river it 's not gonna be long there was two and one meeting we we didn 't hear it 's not gonna be long before someone dies and who 's gonna be responsible for that the council is responsible because you could have maintained this you 're not complying with the law as it sits well we 've come to the end of the 15 minutes but obviously look here aged a whole lot of points I honestly thought Preston 's was discharging unto the Heath into the into the Horseshoe Lake so and we have got plans for wetlands developments on the other side of the Horseshoe Lake for that reason but just meet you something there when they calculate their their planes for the storage of the water they they kept like the map you will see the rise over the earthquakes and everything else natural deep same they 've calculated that up of the river there 's only that much storage in those ponds there that 's only half of water what was expected to be in which which at that time wasn 't enough you know I know for a fact under the priestess subdivision do is supposed to be holding takes in every house because the engineer that redid the original work on that table that it did somebody else took over that development and all those after the earthquake all those holding tents got script so there is no reserve and that in that subdivision for the house orders I need for the road water well you 've raised a lot of issues and I mean the submissions obviously that that came and from the working group has been where the working party have been quite extensive and we were obviously gonna have to do quite a bit of work on them but you know thank you very much for for making the submission thank you for the work that you do being involved in the working party it is important and there 's a lot of work and in responding to in terms of the LTP well we 're in the process at the moment and there are two elements to what you 've done one is this the LTP and you 've quite rightly raised questions around budgeting and and when things are appearing on on on budget for work to be done the other is the overarching planning and I think that there 's there 's more than one issue involved because once you get right down into the Brooklands area then you 've got red zone there government 's indicated that they want to transfer that land to the council and that there 's obviously a considerable amount of work around regeneration planning that needs to be done so it so it 's at a confluence I guess off of a number of issues that do need to be taken into account in a different way so if one 's a long-term plan issue and it 's the funding side of things and terms that the budget that was required to be on there sometimes things there on budget that they don 't look and the other issue as their whole regeneration planning across the whole area of the Styx River which is what the Working Party is all about so but look at marina do you want to refer to your submission now no we have it she just had a really large poisoning event and the cup of tiny Creek much burns into the sticks fish died we had huge eels and trout buffing up against the way Bridget you just saw in the photo over there and I 'm just putting it out there that and when you guys do look read a very diverting water from that industrial area out towards the way McCovey river would possibly be a really good option because the lower steps catchment is saturated right yeah no or thank you very much it 's just the the large Styx River is supposed to be the cleanest River in Christchurch so it 's probably one of the only one left I think it 's just been in Canterbury so it 's because it 's spread feet so it 's probably gonna be you gotta clean that thing yeah no I don 't think thank you very much for your submission its we 'll take it on board thank you the marina what I 'm just gonna _"

    "text": "invite the white hairy eco sanctuary column nuke you 're all good to go yep it 's green as long as your green light coat oh hello again this is about the biodiversity of the city and the promotion of this is part of an eco city brand for the city and in particular the role of what tackle eco century is a vital part of achieving net Kennedy needs multiple eco centuries and my colleague Bruce will follow on and Stanley Bruce white Kennedy needs multiple eco centuries just like many of the other major cities and regions of the country Canterbury is the single largest region without this personal experience of this charismatic endangered wildlife this is our birthright that we 're missing out on here we 're tackling would be the first of a network and Canterbury a stepping stone through space that will fuel a halo effect to surrounding habitats and landscapes we need the added value associated with a predator proof environment and forest forest for Bush birds in particular not just more of the same species for eutrophic wetlands which is what we 're future and already here which is wonderful but it 's it 's not the full quid it will be a stepping stone through time to a predator free New Zealand and I just heard on the radio the government 's announcing a major injection of funding into this we need to be part of that we need to be ready to get some of that central government funding and also for things like the billion trees it 's also related this will be the heart of an ecosystem cinnamon every other city is now beginning to call itself a wildlife capital we 're missing out this is the basis for attracting valued people to New Zealand painting them here as citizens but we have all these assets here ready to go and to develop we 've got a lot of biodiversity but it 's invisible to most people these but these are the core values a place needs a connection to its unique natural and cultural history and both are embodied and nourished by an eco Sanctuary concept you can read the next book yourselves but it 's it 's relevance and I have some deep concerns about this and I would ask what anyone contradict us and saying that Trevor 's Whitman showed the kind of foresight we need now and this project will be building on that legacy and to build on this successful model we need to lead the way in biodiversity promotion through these other initiatives like the crisis by diversity partners at the 360 Trail a strong ecological landscape planning and so on I 'll now pass over to Bruce yeah thanks Colin I just like to mention there four points and Travis wetlands that Colin raised the council purchased the land for Travis wetlands about 20 to 23 years ago and and that 's an ongoing project thank goodness they did and of course the land for Travis 's is not too much different to some of the other land that 's now red zone particularly through there was considerable foresight and travis has has strengthened year by year with the plantings and the other point i 'd like to reinforce that colin mentioned is the halo effect and how important that is as of everyday guy but how important that is that we need a century to provide a protected habitat then spreads out that 's the halo and it will enhance whatever plantings end up going along the route v8 and corridor if you like so it 's an essential part of it the third point i just sort of mention is farms and we know this pressure on funding to have the funding discussion but certainly funding for the red zone must for the UK secretary side but funds must be set aside and the fourth point about the Eco century in particular is just like travis wetlands is it 's about housing the contribution of the community it 's about resourcing the community to actually enhance the community excellent film thank you very much and it 's a good summary of you all together I just want to when the comments you make Colin is you make reference to interim stop banking just wonder if you might elaborate on that Inc it 's a comparison to what might be future possibly permanent stop baking yes we are aware that there council offices and regenerate christchurch about all sorts of problems with this sanctuary in its location and one of them two deals with sea-level rise now mmm we we would see that as the mayor has just pointed out the council is not going to be walking away from the eastern suburbs anytime soon and they 're going to be looking after to maintain those communities on the assets that are there including ones that have been just recently constructed so in order to do that of course we 're probably going to have to kind of ensure that there is appropriate protection for some of the more vulnerable areas including stock banking and so the century would just be one of those assets within that broader area that will need to be looked at the way in which that can be best protected and of course the that major highway you know that goes from North Canterbury to little thing is it goes past or through the century area so we 're obviously not going to walk away from that either so that 's relates to the need to allowed to flood back into salt marsh or something is lots of other areas of the red zone will be thanks and if I make just a supplementary question you refer to that resilient certainty needing to be realistic about future global trends and you also say we can 't afford to be rolls-royce smooth is good enough but we need to deal with the bit with with the big mess of potholes just wonder if you might elaborate on that a wee bit mm yeah well that 's a huge question I mean we 're talking about sort of you know major trends economically resources wise in the future and I mean my own tape as an ecologist who has studied this and is running a course at the WEA this coming week is that things are going to be changing we are going to have to kind of be more relaxed and the way we manage things and not pour heaps of money into unnecessary activities we 're going to have to kind of be more modest in our call on the environment and on the amount of lot of money floating around here and so it 's really part of their it 's about being more rational the way we manage these resources and not believing we 've got to kind of go rolls-royce into it maybe Bruce wants to whatever I don 't know I was just going ahead to to the the first question and the land that we 're seeking for the Eco sentry there 's actually a higher land and Travis wetlands and the need the travis wetlands has is some higher ground for retreat of species thanks Eileen thank you just wanting to join a few dots you know Minister Jones talks about 1 billion trees we have an opportunity with the residential red zone carbon sink etcetera your plans how would you go about setting up a framework to to go about it well as Bruce just said one of the important points about the red zone between Travis Roden and the river is that it 's higher ground it 's been filled and you know we can grow trees on there into the you know a medium-term future and that spine needs not just more raw power and have a kicky as nice as that is but we need they 're taller forest environment and and sort of predator-free in order to get out of ikonics bush birds kind of flourish there yep deal fine Jonnie thank you again just referring to submission on page 95 of our agenda it 's the point you make about prioritizing land drainage you say if it fits with an integrated catchment management approach then yes have you got anything that gives you comfort that that is happening or that there isn 't and and is there a more specific request that you might make of us in regards to how we do the planning about the planting sorry it 's a new submission you talked about the need for an integral catchman our management approach yeah and I 'm just wondering where that 's come from and whether we need to allocate resources to sing that done or whether it 's been done or why you 've put that in there effectively I think I think it 's more about getting the right ecology is is the last cab off the rank it 's kind of consulted after all of the big engineering decisions have been made and often it 's in too late to have a more sort of balanced approach to to the plan and I see this constantly you know a classic case would be the proposal to weave through treaty symbolism through the middle Aven River through the Central City representing you know the English Park then on the one hand and the kind of indigenous forests on the other and it was Scotch bye-bye drainage engineers who believed that would raise the flooding well we could observe at the last big flood middle of last year that H it was the bridges that were the main obstacle to water flow down that catchment and it had nothing to do and so as a result we 've ended up with you know a sort of bad half-baked decision about the catchment management there so that 's the kind of example that I 'm still talking about you know we need to get more expertise around the table at the both very much for your contribution as always very well thought through and and well presented so thank you very much _"

    "text": "ctc cleaning this country Timothy Laurence good morning and welcome I think you all know why I think you all know why I am here to go through pollution problem that really is out of hand let 's propose the speech now hope you can all listen carefully would you eat this plastic bag give marine life would think it as an appetizing jellyfish one of its main food sources hi my name is Tim Lawrence I 've been building in Christchurch now for 10 years and over this time I have noticed that roadside rubbish is becoming worse and they often it is not being picked up last December I started CTC which is cleaning this country via social media my goal was to erase awareness of the increase in rubbish on our streets in in their communities and to encourage people to join me in cleaning this country please excuse me this is my first time doing anything like this I 've been wanting to do this for many years now it 's a great opportunity to get the started the majority of people want to do something their hands dirty by cleaning up their community the environment doesn 't have a voice I want to be the voice of the environment I 'm here today to appeal to the council would you support me is there girl awareness and find practical ways of improving this problem the council has a great record of being invited environmentally focused and friendly my ultimate goal would be to work with the council to remove the growing amount of abundant waste we are seeing right across their Garden City to do this we can 't sit in our offices hands on the ground with motivated people I proposed cleaner city by increasing awareness of CDC and to mobilize volunteers to pick up rubbish we 're and when they see it in post photos etc we can increase awareness by community advertising and social media I would like to work with community groups volunteers and with a number of key a couple of key people who would organize and lead these teams to clean up as a pilot scheme and in the memory of our amazing insects I would love to propose in a long dives road this area is practically covered in rubbish but advertising on community radio and inviting the citizens of Christchurch to join me in cleaning up this area we would see a huge improvement in reduction and waste that is currently sitting on the roadside I would need support from the council with advertising in health and safety by providing Road cones hobo 's vests and road safety management closing the chief of roading regarding roadside rubbish it will not even be picked up unless the complaint is laid that 's not going to clean Christchurch and keep my reputation as the Garden City we need to meet we need to make the trip picking up trash important as we all know the environmental impact that rubbish has when it gets into our waterways ends there care of entire throw or a great place to serve as it 's right next to a waterway what would we do with the rabbits after it has collected as hen sorted making sure that we were making sure everything that can be recycled is recycled resulting in minimal landfill my it into building blocks this is currently being trialed in Tunisia we would measure our success by the community involvement awareness of the issue by how much rubbish rubbish we clicked and gets sorted and finally by how much bit Aragon City looks do not just us that live here but by the thousands of visitors who come to our city annually possible future plans are after I show results it 's the awareness that we must pick up after ourselves and pick up what we see finally wouldn 't it be great if cleaning this country could gain funding if we show good result and build awareness I would like the council to provide full support and permanent funding in summation I am passionate about cleaning our city and improving our environment to impact I hope you all seriously consider my proposal and request for support I would like to leave you with this quote from Taurus New Zealand beautiful scenery but doesn 't it better that all we can see is the sight of the letter thank you feel free you have time my first time you 're you for the opportunity to put forward my proposition everywhere you look around you rubbish is everywhere we live in the garden city look under the gardens and what do we see plastic bottles you name it it 's everywhere this is New Zealand we need to do something to keep it clean they call New Zealand one of the cleanest it 's not the cleanest country in the world look around you is it really it 's not just the roads needing cleaned it 's the rivers features parks and walking tricks litter is everywhere I would like to say so much more about a little problem it makes me so angry about the situation I hope you can understand how bad it actually is thank you all for listening but please stay with us one thing after today look around you on the roads you will surely see what I 'm talking about it 's a very big problem hmm keep your eye on the time because time is ticking and no one is cleaning this country I don 't need pictures to prove it just this morning Road rubbish all around them and none of it gets picked up can I work this morning how much did you get to clean the city I spend a lot of my time cleaning up building sites they are the last of my worries that 's help City this whole country needs more been a constant kid keep on top of our pollution thank you very much it 's absolutely a theme of the LTP that 's why I raised it you know are we are we really committed to the to the Garden City you know who we are and you 've really challenged us to think about that and I 'm just thinking last year just before I went to the keep Christchurch beautiful Awards which must have been about this time last year because that 's on again next week exactly that I felt like right I 'm going to do what you just did and I went from my walk around Trevor sweet lands and I took my rubbish bag with me on the way there on the way back on the way back I 've ran out of room and my one shopping bag that I took with me and fortunately somebody had thrown a plastic bag out of their car window as well and so I filled that up as well and it was too full completely Chaka rubbish bags just on a Sunday over an hour yawn glean mother 's mother 's day but today there 's the mother of all clean ups but are you aware of the mother of all clean ups that bets on today so there 's community groups right now so I mean know most of us would have loved to have been there helping you know the our communities cleaning up the waterways all sorts of all over the city the mother of all cleanup so that happens yeah so that happens so while you 're talking about it with us you know there 's lots of people out there so we need to connect you with people it 's actually worthwhile to connect people like you with other groups that are doing an SSI are you aware of keep Christchurch beautiful kid New Zealand beautiful so so we 're gonna we 're gonna connect you up with some people yes oh no but it 'd be good to have some connections I wouldn 't go out wearing a suit like that so thank you thank you very much for they ultimately it 's the third year of this mother of all cleanup so it 's both the river corals or power Heathkit Ivan or Tucker also but I think what you 're saying is this needs it 's in a teaching elegy about it 's a regular everywhere not clean oh yeah I 'm working at North Kent with the moment a lot going up to kaikoura clearance the whole local government sectors pushing hard back on plastic bags bringing straws to see yeah no no no no it 's weird we cover the whole of we cover the whole of the banks peninsula so we 're just as committed in terms of the rural environment as we are to the urban environment Sarah and then Vicki Vicki local cleanups as well so we feed them and represent for example from a church and surely and rubbish away for free it 's we 've organized them through the community board I don 't know if you know the local community board chair but I think we could introduce ya Yanni last question yeah just quickly but we are also as a council pursuing the the dealing with waste at source through local governments so we 've put forward a number of remotes to try and recognize that it 's not just the picking up that 's important but also actually preventing it from being there in the first place so we are challenging that on a little bit so but thank you for what you 're doing and thank you for the submission there 's really good all right I 've just and we 're gonna wind up for lunch now but I just I 've just had it confirmed from the deputy mayor that the Metro sector is backing all our remotes so that 's that means we don 't have to go any further the Metro sector will lodge them so that 's great thank you all right so we 're now adjourned until 30 and if people could be here _"

    "text": "Elizabeth O 'Dell good morning excuse me I have chosen many years ago not to own a cat because I think it takes about a minute much resources to maintain one that could be used elsewhere so on that point I have made a submission you speaking very clearly to roots I use there 's a full-time bike rider and I think there are a lot about probably representing quite a lot even reasonably large amount of people there are quite a lot of people who just do what I do just ride bikes and okay passes so this is so I want to first and foremost I want to okay so I watched ice road be upgraded and I thought it because there was lots of space that there would be a cycle way vociferated so I could wake up there and it was not I know I disappointed it 's a dangerous road if you 're on a bike is I 'm a very confident bike rider I 've ridden a bike for many many years hmm but that 's probably one of the spaces that makes me and we never know whatever now a cycle way through there was a golden opportunity to connect up with a nice new cycle way that 's going through to the live yep where we would have been able to bike down from South right and South Shore area and doing that to go to Sumner or into town or whichever way I don 't think parents are going to want their teenagers to be riding down the or the young people to be writing down I wanted to the scramble tracks there 's a terrible must opportunity it was in GTA it 's a state highway route and it 's just a tragic shame and we have raised within zip ta our desire to see them every time they 're building State Highway particularly in urban environments to put a cycle where long Snider 's it 's like almost no skin off their nose to do so so but thank you for that it 's well it 's it 's state highway it 's not a council road yeah debris that 's been left on the road and we 're we 're also pursuing it yeah okay but but just just to say that it won 't be it 's not we 're not looking at it as part of the LTP we can certainly ask them but it 's not council Road yeah thank you okay sorry okay but there is a cycle way there so carry on yeah the all sorts do you go from Bridge Street it 's space and revel it 's really narrow it 's covered in weeds a lot of the time and she just got mowed a week or two ago the guy who ever mow through it they 've mostly black through neva at least one only wrote they mowed right through the whole pile of rubbish that it be done via and so created a whole pile of small broken but suppressed bacteremia that was a great news so while they made it a bit easier to get your bike through but it wasn 't a pretty sight at all especially basically you go down on the history side so you write you to the history then you 've got to can 't get all the way through you 've got a cross through the tracks there 's sanctuary in the middle on the other side of the century there 's a huge crack and someone 's nipple log of wood over it as it was that it 's dangerous you 've got to go through what was it was once a soccer field he 's a great pole in the middle of it it 's not I think any of us has been touched since the earthquakes if not before its roots Trevor it 's true and it 's got this like damage the whole thing and it 's basically ratty in pothole and it 's really like they 're right through to NZ rich you quite right you have quite a bumpy approach onto ends a bridge to get onto it then on the other side you 've basically got to chuck down to get up to New Brighton Road you 've got to sort of get around and it 's the whole thing from loom Adair through you could actually write off-road if you put that cycle way road to mainland throat you can get right through it with just link up with the site good flash cycle way so you put it in all it needs there 's some tiny out some upgrade and that 's what I 'm asking to be done yeah it 's like always just a lot Jessica some people before have said when I was sitting here that cycle guys are all very nice that are nice to hear but they 're not important and that 's saying that people won 't meet but not important we are we use our something with it the cycle ways are used by commuters going into account who may or may not pay for the cars they want to take it they 're used by people like me who use them for getting our groceries we use them for if we want to go through the have to go through the Sun or anything like that we go if it 's a very long distance you 're not a fast bike was but I am a very confident one and but I go into areas your bike there oh this is a bit dangerous isn 't it scary and that 's why I think the separators a little ways Thanks when you wanna you don 't have to when you 're on the actual road you have to be are we yeah so we have to do it 's being in my sister 's bathroom my best friend is South sure it 's not being chaotic as far as I know but it takes 55 minutes to 60 minutes to get from my house in the South Brighton and to the bus exchange I can write that in 30 minutes no six different right you know instead of going what we would think would be a more direct route which would have been says the nearest mall that 's what the east gate and then straight through to town it takes you all the way around and like terrace and Marshalls right any key to go past the palms and you did it around and you go everywhere it seems to me that what you can 't have done is try to use the least without regard to where people live or the fact that they might actually want to get into town to go to work I don 't but I was might quite right this is he came and I mean it 's not you know we 're we 're we would love it to be us yeah this is another bus for ya we have made a submission to Eakins long-term plan asking them not to catch any of the routes so we 've already done there they are going to make their decision about the roots as part of their LTP we can do make no more we 've submitted on it we agree with you 100% they should not be cutting these roots know that there is going to be a process which will commence and after the 1st of July which will lead to a public consultation on the new roots as proposed after the it probably be at the end of the year or no it 'll be at the beginning of next year so you will have an opportunity to submit to he can around the new we 'll thank you very much and much appreciated coming on it 's good to hear a powerful advocate for you know the particular form of transport that you use and you know you you are irrelevant and you 've made yourself relevant and all those who choose to cycle and not to use cars you know others that you 're an important part of our city it always up thank you very much _"

    "text": "Megan Ralston by welcome submission my name is Megan Ralston and I live in south shore with my husband Tim and our two boys heat Damian Francis I 've recently been involved on the how team a group established to write an engagement strategy from reading about Christchurch on how to talk to South Shore and South in writing about coastal hazards and the replay reads own land I 'm also on the board of the bridge South Brighton trust establishing a new multi-use communities facility in an area which lost all its shots and services to the earthquakes but today I 'm just speaking to you as a social resident I have supplied a photo of my home on North Road it 's a home to poor people just one of the nearly 500 families living in South Shore I 'm new to civics and I did find it very difficult to read the long term thing but these just the things that are important to me South Shore is an asset to Christchurch it 's both an outstanding environment and an amazing community it should be seen in be lead as an adaptive klemming but it is great to consume to me that there is no acknowledgement of the regeneration strategy for South Shore South Brighton and the infrastructure strategy there needs to be funds available to implement the regeneration strategy and I asked that sufficient funding be allocated my asset make a commitment and allocate funding for film a permanent flood protection and south join South Brighton I look toward my neighbors across the history and see a well-engineered scene war on virtual Road at a cost of I think around 8 million protecting I think around 140 houses and I 'm aware of the 26 million or so spent on flood protection on flopped and basin and Dudley Creek protecting around five hundred and eighty-five homes are the nearly five hundred families and South Shore not to mention the families in South Brighton deserving of similar protection if not why not Christchurch City Council has a duty to provide protection so short could be promoted as a tourist destination if you add us to the coastal path works pathways cycle network build attracted another spec and the city it 's already a well used walking and cycle area possibly be reused in the Summoner causeway tract because the high flood management zone and the district plan used to 1 meter sea level rise that has resulted an onerous Planning restriction said the public were not fully aware of at the time the plane went through its truncated process the engagement on this was disgraceful and has had a significant negative impact and well-being on our community I know a families who have tried to extend their homes and you 've been denied I know people trying to build on beer land where they used to be a house prior to the earthquake and they 've been denied when the district plan went through my understanding was that there was a residential unit over they put on South Shore the hearings panel found that the risk of flooding and social was linked to sea level rise and therefore the risk to life was not eminent and thus it wasn 't necessary to avoid building and that planning rules could be restrictive discretionary but that 's just my happening his accounts are using the high flood management rules to deny building it appears to the community that you want retrieved by stealth flood protection was in place and South Shore it would have a dramatic effect on the consent rules my understanding as there other areas and price which do not have such restricted planning oils at South Shore because they have sea wolves that negate the need for mitigation of flooding because South Shore has no protection each individual new or extended property has to reinvent the wheel to provide their own mitigation for consent the building of an area-wide flood protection system will allow area wide mitigation this will provide some evidence a bio council own reasoning indicates a risk reduction in infant and in tune can influence problems around the provisions of consent I want a commitment from Christchurch City Council that you will engage properly in effectively on coastal hazards and that engagement will result in action that is reflected in the district plan in other documents in this will require adequate funding I said beliefs sadly believe that some councillors and council staff coastal management and this could be not be further from the truth we 've stood up stood up against maladaptive processes that are short-sighted and we 've had an adequate community consultation area we have considerable local knowledge we have been in Stella crying out for engagement on adaptive planning solutions solving problems means listening inside every problem lies an opportunity and I want the South Shore term I remain a vibrant community with a future for my children thank you thank you very much and I mean this has taken us to the end of your time um yeah there 's an enormous ly challenging issue some that presentation and part of its in relation to the long term plan which is very very relevant but the other part that you speak to as the pricey that we go through around regeneration planning with some elements read zoned and others not and then the two sides the history side and the in the coastal June side so yeah it 's probably headed and budgets around things like you know sort of stop banks and various other bits of work with with a purpose of mind so but not an endpoint in mind so it 's I want to kind of reassure you around there no there isn 't and I have to say that you know and I have to confess that I 've been picked up now twice on on not picking up certain words that were included in the plan so I didn 't see the word retreat in there and I know it is in there and it shouldn 't have been that should have been language around we don 't you know what options are going to be considered because we as accounts ones the local government here cannot go to an endpoint we have to consider options and language is really important and I apologize if I had seen the word I would have insisted it had come out and I 'm just it just instructs me that I have to read every single word in future but it it does you know I want to make it clear that adaptive management as the approach that this council has endorsed and will continue to you very much that is a gorgeous house in fact I 've seen it I 've seen their house Ellis _"

    "text": "Easter period your worship esteemed counselors we are the peer enfermo we 're from New Brighton you 've only good me five minutes so I could talk as you all know five minutes is probably the shortest amount of time I 've ever spoken so I put together a very rush to submission but I just want to focus on four things quickly so hopefully we can get to some questions Freda keeping I love reading camping on the Freddy camper I 've traveled all around New Zealand and Kemper veins and tints and I was really excited when we opened up our community to share the awesomeness of New Brighton with the world there was some expectations around things like broken fences and lots of rubbish but as you see I 'm quite adept at using the snap scene to solve it so it 's an expectation it certainly has been delivered are those broken fences are current I think that when we talked about free camping we thought about people being self-contained these are apparently self-contained keeper means but I can prove to you they 're not because Jose where I love and I discovered and I also discovered this quite uncomfortable I 'll just leave it there for a little bit you may be wondering how long it took me to compile all this excellent data how far ahead to trick sadly this was an afternoon in autumn at approximately 45 and I walked three hundred and ninety six point two seven meters another thing I 'd like to talk about is are some equity what what appears to be an equally but I 'm really just happy to consider swapping some staff if I can give the people who are doing that garden at the bottom to do the garden that is the gateway to New Brighton that would be awesome and if I could also have the planners and engineers who designed the sea wall on that side to designer to sea wall on the other side it would be great I know that private property is not the council 's agenda but you 've proved that you can do something about landlords who are shells we 've got quite a few of them in me less than five minutes the New Brighton on Wednesday afternoon this has not taken me very long to compile finally I 'd like to talk about the fact that we are over agencies and I know it 's not a word to death currently we are being asked to engage with City Council DCL and regenerate that photo dia is what 's my photo that cartoon there shows how I felt last year we have last where I was given a submission from every I was asked to submit bond and proposal from every one of those agencies and all the submission dates ended in one week city council were asking me how I folk that felt about the Marine Parade real landscape DCL were asking me what I thought about their polls and regenerate asked me if they would like to put low-income housing in a rally to demand or pretty critical things but we have come a long way as you all know well most of you know this time three years ago we got pretty wild our community is still pretty wild but there are some hot saltwater pools we now have a beachside playground we 've retained roughly two domains although every agency wants to seem to have a bit of it and we 're still with our camping ground personally in the last three years since you 've seen me I 've been heavily involved in the jerky stability and that 's picture there is the outdoor movie night that was funded with council funds so we 'd like to say thank you for that so hopefully that 's been quick because I 'm more than welcome to very good I don 't think I 've ever heard you speak for such a short period of time Esther but you know it 's actually a really powerful promotion and often I think that if you focus on you know short presentation with the imagery as you have it leaves a huge impression around the table so I 'm Erin so as part of the LTP we asked the question around other four sources of funding and one of them was and there 's a slightly loose question around the fuel tax but if we could be any amount but we could essentially ask the government if we 're allowed to and then would you want to see that money spent on fixing all the roads and footpaths across the city first before we spend it on other things I think that obviously I have friends and as well but I think it 's a little bit telling that all of us at Eastern Suburbs we are all dealing with rolling and drainage to be honest it 's those are the see cities as ripe as they shouldn 't be something with evil hidden to talking about I just can 't believe we are talking about it I think a absolute baseline I 'm not going to have discussions about sura droning you should just do it it 's insane that you are asking me to talk about rolling in cirrage this is community yeah that 's not I think that I think that the message that we 've got really received the message loud and clear I think that one of the things that people have found incredibly hard to understand is why the that has been a real opening of the eyes to the what the cost-sharing agreement was with central government and you know there is there there is a real genuine feeling that we 've been shortchanged by their agreement so thank you very much for your submission we 've got a lot of work to be doing and it 's some all right we 're on a break so the great to me to see you again time thank you I just want to thank you that I guess that 's kind of a sense of siloing when you 're being talked to by cautious it accounts so reaching relevant those agencies we I think it 's a really clear message for me certainly that we 've got to remind ourselves in those groups or wanting information it 's got to be together yeah I think we could really take learning from the mental health center when they say no door is the wrong door yeah currently if I talk to somebody in the street and say oh I 've got a really great idea about this they 'll say talk to detail yeah I mean that 's ridiculous knock on door I think that what I mean I 'm very strongly of the view that we should meet regenerate Christchurch DCO and attack Errol and just have a single agency that does the planning and the delivery but that 's something that we 'll continue to work on but look thank you very much no please please please please right we 're going to June for a break and we will be back here at five past eleven with gene Bell thank you _"

    "text": "Beasley yeah you stood like to us because it already fest main films and as it all my father comes up sure as well yeah yeah yeah you know I asked for a submission for to make the no right tunings but I know I won 't get that but my prime thing I 'd like as I 'd like the truth on how cycleways actually came about there 's an internet site that talks about overseas organization called agenda 21 it 's a fact that John Key joined us up to agenda 21 in its effect that he authorized eighty percent of taxpayers pays money to pay for cycle ways how come whenever I speak to one of you counselors about why this came about I just and if I mention that I just get shouted at no that 's rubbish I emailed in Galway and I asked for the truth around there I think I got an email back saying that 's actually on my phone they 're now saying thank you very much for your inquiry I will refer that to my headed seek it up and that email was a couple of months ago at the time among the cycleways when they were really impacting it straight my father here he emailed you the mirror in T ask for your opinion your email Beckwith saying thank you very much I will refer to my personal secretary I mean oddly it was a moment of the phone for messages on cell phones I just feel that Isis ratepayers and taxpayers funding all this we need to know the truth I can 't see out would be public opinion when there was a huge and seat of to do the cycle ways were the government authorizing 80 percent but in his membership to agenda 21 I mean a lot of bubble people want me to talk about other a speaks of how the cycle ways are impacting businesses and stuff but I just want to struck this down at the bottom how did they come about how can you what we 're doing is we 're actually consulting on the long-term plan at the moment so that 's you know this is the opportunity for people to have of cycleways and that 's then that 's something that you should be you know making making your case for I think that the the original decisions around the cycleway Network if you actually think of it the major cycleway routes were established as a as a network program of work prior to most of us actually being elected to the council so it 's it was a long-standing decision after the earthquakes to put in place an accessible city in the Central City and a and major cycleway route network to enable people to use these cycles to get into the central city and across the central city in an easy way we provide for cars this is providing for cyclists but we 're not we 're not spending 200 million I think this is that this is the the tricky thing I mean Roberts said very clearly that the government 's making a contribution so we put in the total amount of the program but we are funded back two-thirds of the cost through central government understand it but they 'd see a central government contribution sorry I Parker where that I support cycleways but I don 't think a lot having thought about other people who have chronic health conditions or disabled getting around the city with all the cycleways and the lack of disabled parking and people can 't access the public transport easily if you 've got a wheelchair if you 've got a walker a stroller I support we need to be clean green carbon neutral and things like that but at the expense of people that are suffering with chronic health conditions might not even recognize Lyme disease here it 's here but don 't never be noted but we need to think of these people that are struggling I can 't even ride a bicycle because of my disease I can 't even balance on it and leave it to others who 've had that that aren 't being diagnosed we need to be looking at helping people with illness as well as differently those areas in the East that are struggling with community facilities etc to help health groups go into some of these community centers and set up as well drains and mosquitoes images and also ticks so we need to be doing research in there so that people can get healthy maybe I don 't know whether that was the point of Roberts submission to us no no no but but we 've come to the end of the time now you know my my whole point was just you 're all happy to share things at my face but you 're not happy to actually say in it confirm an email for what you see it was real okay well look I will take it to undertake Robert on behalf of all of the cancers to respond to you on your specific questions in relation to agenda 21 I will do there for you thank you [Applause] [Music] _"

she 'd have been a member of Richmond for nine years when I first moved in I could see a need for neighborhoods support as I had been encouraged by Nyree button most of you may know who who is a great support for me in sitting up neighborhood support for Avalon Street and I 've also been a volunteer in the Christchurch area for 37 years and I want to thank the New Zealand Girl Guides for that I have given to my the Christchurch area and the community for 37 years so that 's just a little bit about myself I am sorry my main point one of my main points is the stable road crossing and the capsules will know about this Steve Monroe by the blue T key inside lane bar we have a pedestrian crossing this is very dangerous I have got a petition that I I 've got over 500 language and I have spoken to most disease people but there 's him I understand at the pedestrian crossing getting signatures I 'm going into the businesses and into the bars and speaking to people people are giving me stories I know of peoples that have been hit they 've been injured on this crossing and I have seen some IOH who first contacted the council in 2016 and was flogged off I got told oh excuse me I was actually told come back in 2000 seen March 2017 we would be able to see you then and I thought okay radio so I gave him a big grace and I see run came back in 2017 I spoke to councillors I spoke to Bay Road engineer and we 've had a camera out and he 's saying it 's true quite actually spoke to Barry a road engineer just in the last couple of weeks and he said from the office it 's too quiet it 's not busy we 've had statistics saying that it 's not a very busy area and I about coming out and seeing me how about coming out and seeing Richmond come on to the wheel rubber meets the road so he did and I was really sad to hear that on the phone so he actually came out his eyes were opened he met I grab some locals off the street I see have you had issues with his pedestrian and he said Masek yes this is heaven I 've nearly been killed one lady CS seed I waited sick for 16 cars to go past here and the seventeenth stopped for me you know we heard I can show you yeah let 's see it happened another car stopped by and stopped on the pedestrian crossing and I said to him I thought it was illegal to stop on the pedestrian crossing and he see that is he was actually embarrassed I see why are these cars stopping on the pedestrian crossing and waiting I realize we have where bricks and that 's holding up some things at the moment but why occurs waiting on a pedestrian crossing but is that bus stationary yes so it on this pedestrian crossing so we are asking for I have seen this pedestrian crossing in huntly of all places I mean tap to Huntley a couple of years ago and I saw this pretty string crossing and I thought fantastic look at it it 's got the zigzags at the side it 's got the blue bars you know poles at the side we could have this in Christchurch actually mention it to the councillors and see this would be a good example to put actually we end all Christchurch it was sort of rubbish Tibet I felt and I said well okay right it 's gonna cost too much it 's gonna cost 70,000 we don 't have that money for Richmond we don 't have that money and I said how much has a life how much is your mother her as much as your sister and Westar Street you 've got six raised crossings 6 raised Jeddah bars between stem more and fits to your dev it 's four hundred and twenty thousand dollars that you 've put in Wooster Street alone in that little section the other option that we 're looking at is lights stay more Avalon Street but it 's too much of an issue it 's too much money the other thing we were looking it originally is to help out new Weald which is part of our community because people we were looking at two crossings which is going to cost you more but let 's do one maybe the lights no it 's gonna cost too much money the council are still say so we 're also looking we want either either for the community to be safe but it 's still costing too much money and the council don 't give it to me I see the number of emails a number of questions and councilors and the community board do not keep it to me I had Barry the engineering out on the second of May and his eyes were opened we meet down to Ruby 's cafe that five doors down he stood on the street could not see the road pedestrian crossing he was surprised very surprising hey Steve we need something done around here let nothing 's been done we actually got one extra sign when I say nothing 's been done we 've got one extra sign the student moving some signs moving some Road cones he 's added a sign and nothing 's been done he was going to give it to a couple of us to give us some options but nothing 's been done no surprise very disappointed well look what you 've done as you 've raised in highlighted that issue here now at the long-term plan hearings we are considering and because it was one of the questions that we specifically asked and the LTP was whether we should be no because you come to the end of your time so I 'm trying to wrap up and and what what what you 've highlighted is something that we have asked people to comment on and that is the priorities around some of the traffic issues so it 's for roadworks and also for our traffic safety issues so and we have specifically asked that as a question you 've raised that issue around around a particular corridor which has got other challenges as well in terms of traffic that 's been diverted but when traffic gets back to normal then some of the directions of tribal and how people get to stand more Road will change so it 's a corridor that does need to be looked at and you 've highlighted a type of pedestrian crossing which we should be considering so you know I think you 've made a very powerful motion just tell counselors that the photographs are on the hub so that this particular presentations been loaded onto the hub 's so that people can see it so look it 's been a very good submission thank you very much and we will take that into consideration when we look at the LTP and you are absolutely not the only one to raise this as an issue with respect to Richmond we 've had very strong representations from the Richmond community so thank you very much for your time this morning okay thank you [Applause] _"

    "text": "tension all right so I shall I call the first submission which is Mary James thank you good morning do we use these devices or it just happens more Dana koto Marie James topic we know what law on tataki Richmond are hurt good morning everyone Mary Gaines is my name and I 'm a resident of Richmond 's Christchurch thank you for the opportunity to address the council I need to do appreciate the Democratic opportunity that we have living in this environment I made the submission as a private citizen a rate payer in Richmond today but I am also involved now I would like to begin by adding my personal support to the submission that was made by Haley professor on Monday it was a well formed some tube submission in his mouth for support hopefully council will view that in a similar light um I 've been a resident of Richmond for some time I have a generational association with it across four generations with my great grandmother living in chants of the street by selling rather than pictures and for my submission I 'd like lack of consideration to Richmond is a suburb in the consequence what appears to me to be under investment and it blocked attention to that I 'd like to also draw some attention to what I consider to be a disappointing focus on social housing in light of the current environment and I would also like to the offer of OK 'd council around what appears to be continuing support of heritage retention so I will be brief but I 'll begin and I 'll start with Richmond in Mori Richmond is a suburb has enormous potential but I think it has received the rough end of the stick for some time its residents in the suburb itself were quite badly affected by the Canterbury Earthquake sequence not only in terms of damage to individual residents homes businesses and infrastructure but also by central government 's read zoning with large tracts of the suburb which resulted in depopulation essentially that 's beginning to recover but it certainly made life difficult for businesses in the location on top of that Richmond has endured quite significant interruption in terms of roading projects 's introduced significant elements of second division for example if you take Slater Street Chancellor Petrie crystal they 've all been closed completely going staff for almost two years yeah that may not sound like much but actually it means that you have to do it quite another way and also bypass the business sector yeah it 's already been stated but I 'll stay again the businesses sort of focused around the stem the road top North Haven Road end of Richmond have been severely affected by that traffic has been diverted away takings are well down some of them are studies to the point where closure is almost imminent and that does not appear to have been considered it may have been but certainly understanding that I believe should be as a Richmond look we have a the the rhodium is another thing I 'll come to there and see in the but despite the interruption despite the challenges Richmond is actually a very vibrant community and what has arisen there 's a rather active network of community representatives who we 're doing really really good work and perhaps because of them I think engagement from Council with those with those people the community groups that are keen to be engaged with the team to be heard the stop thing that would provide real benefit really like a Chili 's that 's that 's considered in respective rodent the North Haven Road works the the Dudley Dudley flood management works have caused an awful lot of interruption yeah that 's okay it 's expected it 's understood the outcomes that they achieve ultimately I fear it much the quiet but there are some things that perhaps could be considered by council if you look at the area of Richmond from Shirley Road back to North Haven that 's where a lot of us work is going on and it appears to me as a resident in those locations but the remedial work at conclusion of the works there 's essentially a picture drawn the roading that 's been reformed but in some cases without curb and channel is quite poor in terms of conditions and that 's relatively a position for the prisoners and that block I think I 'm just aware that we 've come to the end of the five minutes whip through the doesn 't it 's fun around reasonable income it 's something that I think personally Christchurch has had a proud history in that area and it could do with some more consideration huge consentual any private moment and I guess you get like some sort of feedback negative about private ownership heritage building been funded by grants from Council any private owners only temporaries but temporaries bank holder in that building the building ten sees any temporary owner of it and therefore it deserves consideration and please the council continues thank you but thank you very much and I should have said at the outset you know we have met every submission and you know we want you to come to the table to to highlight the key points what you actually have done I don 't know that questioning would have added anything anyway but if people want to leave time for questions then they 'll welcome to as well that 's a relatively short period of time but thank you powerful contribution to our consideration thank you thank you very much I know that there 's a lot of Richmond residents in the house I used to live in Draper Street so there 's some sympathy at the scenes of the table for the things that you 're raising say thank you in advance

thank you very much indeed for joining us behind me I 've got a team too much of your time I know you 're busy I 've been the local Member of Parliament for Christchurch seats for about five years and the last two a report that lists my activity and the report showed that about 5% of the work that my office deals with is actually within the council jurisdiction you know drains rubbish breaches of consents and the like so it 's quite a significant amount of work that we do to support our council I work with officials directly and with staff sometimes with councillors and community board members but the way that I work is actually to hold my line until I get a result and on a recent visit that work that was organized by the residents of Shirley in Richmond myself and Mike Davidson space of about an hour so meet with six individuals and families to discuss a variety of issues that I have brought to you today you have a copy of the documents that the residents gave me on that day and I hope you take the opportunity to read it and makes the compelling reading they talkin the various submissions about lack of repair like a repair of drains of roads of footpaths that are impassable of trip hazards in general neglect and they drains due to throught dam flooding in how they 've been treated by officials in staff and contractors I met with three households directly one woman who 's on this beautiful property she 's across the creek from the contractors she suffers from the movement of machinery from the dumping of material during the day and at night she has she 's got to put up with the sound of generators and pumps disturbing Huson her space she 's actually also got to mitigate her property for safety for when her grandchildren with it I heard from another family whose driveway has had to be carved out to widen a drain they argued with council officials for five months that she would not be able to get her vehicles in and out of her garage five months it took five minutes for an official to go down there and try attempt to put her car into the garage to realize that they 'd made a mistake and they had to actually do something about the plans they argued for five months here is another I didn 't actually meet the access through his driveway to his property for the best part of a year and has to cross the creek across a scaffold platform which is completely inappropriate and I was shocked by what I saw but what was even more shocking was when I went to a citizenship sir that evening and spoke to a counselor about what I 'd seen that day I got from that counselor and I 'm paraphrasing that the East has had more than its fair share of rats that shocked me even more and I 've been stewing about it ever since I was not expecting to have this expressed in such a blasian way and perhaps that counselor said who said it to me doesn 't really realize how bad at us and doesn 't mean realize how bad that statement was I believe such as the negative bias that has gone on unchallenged about the East and I 'm here to remind you that as elected representatives you have to get rid of you and negative East viced attitudes and change your frame of reference you are about to embark upon you need to reuse a lens of equity of immunity for all citizens so that the citizens of the East suburbs can have access to the same amenities at the same level as anyone else in the city if I think about the residents that I met that I sent you the information on they are making sacrifices for the benefit of the whole city and in particular the residents of flocked and basin and they deserve to be treated with respect and kindness what you as councillors same essence you are our civic leaders and you have resource at your disposal and discretion attitudes that are expressed by councillors permeate to the officials who write the reports that you use to base your decisions on and they permeate your staff and their dealings with the public I implore you to read the material ACQ and see it for what it is it 's a specific case about a specific neighborhood but it 's also representative of the inequity that we experience across the suburbs of the east I implore you to embark upon a community roadshow to see and feel we have been treated this is a small microcosm of what issues in the eastern suburbs ah but it 's representative of the way we feel we have been treated and had our views and wishes for our communities dismissed we need to do this together I congratulate the councilors and the community board members from the eastern suburbs and I now see how big your challenge is that you face to get our projects across the line I 'm here to support your efforts and to work with you we are all citizens of the city and we deserve a fair allocation of resource to ensure that we can move on from the quakes we didn 't cause the quakes but we continue to be impacted by them and council has a vital role in helping us to recovery to the same level as anyone else in the city please treat us with fairness and ensure that we have an equitable allocation to support the things that we need to help our communities thrive thank you and thank and thank you very much for coming along and raising of support it 's important that we we work together to resolve these issues I 'm aware of a body of work which is going on through the community board I 'm also aware of some communications which have been handled through our communications team in recent days but there are certainly some good suggestions that that have been made in your presentation this morning we 'll read the papers which have been supplied with interest and if that leads on to further conversations and further work that needs to be done well this will have been a very useful exercise so thank you very much indeed once again for joining us this morning kyouda so now moving to item 3.2 deputations by appointment there are non item for presentation of petitions there are non item 13 supplementary reports so we 've got the one additional report tie or a qe2 recreation sports center new cafe lease and I 'm happy to move the resolution that we receive and include that report in today 's agenda do I have a seconder Sarah Templeton all those in favor against that 's the strategic capability Committee minutes so a resolution that we receive the minutes which I 'm also happy to move Pauline Carter habit second all those in favor against that 's carried ok staff reports item six financial performance report for the nine months to the 31st of March do we have staff died on you I 'm joining us for this one thank you very much another introductory comments that you 'd like to make to this they 're sort of eight weeks of the year remaining and the bad news does tend to arrive in the last eight weeks we provided for that but I guess I can 't_''_1214.99 be absolutely certain thank you very much so this reports coming straight to Council because we don 't have a finance and performance committee meeting this month because of the work that we 're doing on the LTP so are there any questions for died on this report yawning just trying to get some understanding I think the previous finance report had reference to I thought it was Botanic Gardens staff or operational staff being charged to Higley oval been pointed out the reverse we 've got Botanic Gardens staff charging time to Hagley Park and we 're now being told that there 's a alt on non-urgent spending in a review underway can you just give us some understanding of what 's going going on there find out but I don 't okay so this really we should previous at the Finance Committee when we got the other information around hey glee over will ask for some additional information that I have is the first thing constitute a Parks restructuring some childless staff were charging to the wrong code so park so corrected that in a second sentences a different issue to charging it 's because the park series forecasting the overspend at the end of the year so we 're reviewing the budget to try pull back the budget underline is with other that 's been done alright and can you just give us a sense of in terms of the capital around the parks and the operational like we 've got a number of new sports fields that have been caught existing sports has been upgraded 've also heard through the LTP submissions around concerned that we 're upgrading these fields but we don 't have enough money to so operationally to maintain them is there is there any comment just at a high level around the sports fields upgrades and have those budgets are tracking versus the topics that we 're putting in place we can get you some information on that I think some of the comments are relate to when perhaps a trans do to us so some of the public realm and things like that particularly for instance when a taco transfers some we need to make sure that we incorporate our px in Tibet so there 's been a large number of Park Theatre your time so if we can get some information on that and circulating it around everybody that would be great thank you very much and are you sorry just in relation to that then the final question are you expecting like when things like the former T TV site gets transferred over that we 'd get a report to Council just you know probably showing us what you see that it 's just a sort of memo well I think we can update you on those things so that as I recall Bruce Rendell or did some manipulation great thank you Sarah thank you question here on the special fund so page 13 now looks at their capital endowment fund pork has to be over allocated position will improve by 90,000 of Christ Jonesy it secures the 1.4 million of Oz of the funds so does that mean that Christchurch and Zed has bid for funds that we 're currently so we 're currently allocated money any way to it through the Ketil on down the fund from one of those projects we always allocate Christchurch New Zealand funds come partly through the capital endowment fund we 're simply flagging that depending on what the outcome is of the long term plan there could be attorneys but the the 90,000 there does that mean that we 've we 've allocated 90,000 to something that will then not be needed if Christchurch indeed gets it through LTP instead yes so what was that 90,000 for do you know down a tiny amounts it 's sort of a large amount of funding that 's provided we 've got visibility on the cable endowment fund and what we not for events some of the events that we transferred over we will check that for you yeah it 's very specific amount it would it would have been part of the and in terms of the transfer and the establishment of Christchurch in seat we transferred some of the funding that we had for particular things nicest my suspicion as it was for some of their being secretary it 's just that the the LTP there 's been covering something that we think that we 're already covering for them some of it so the LTP but a number of things yeah yeah so so we can find out specifically what bits pour yeah but I I think is it was established some of the things that we transferred over included things like some of the events that we were providing that came out of they kept of wonderment fun I just need to cheat there so it would be interesting means that we could reduce the 1.4 by 90,000 and still achieve the same thing given that we 've got the 90,000 here it would be an this will be an interesting piece of information to feed into the LTP deliberation around this particular item which given the submissions that we 've heard and we will almost certainly be having indeed you so much Yanni 's point where these it seems to be things that are cross budget areas so on page 20 of our agenda it looks at the permanent forecast overspend in roads and footpaths as driven by the make major cycle ways of projects and then on the next page and transport which the major cycleway program as the main driver for the year today under speed in having the like waste project across two different budgets means that looks not particularly clear and this kind of reporting how that is treating so if we can do something to make that dough no clearer how does that how does that work in the budget yeah it 's just that in one area it 's overspent the other rather than on one all right thank you and then any further questions all right great so do I have a mover for this report laughs happy to move on having a second all those in favor against that 's carried thank you so then moving on to item 7 the capital endowment fund so we 've got the same team remaining at the table for this one thank you so questions first of all and noting in the report we 've got obviously discussion around the 40 split but also the note that all of the fund that 's able to be applied is is currently spoken for would the resolution of the staff recommendation today mean that we would then be able to apply additional funds to give effect to the 40 split whereas at the moment we 're not able to do that because the fund is already expended so that the effect of this essentially if we were to take the staff recommendation would be to give effect to that previous decision we made about the 40 split yep so the discussion today is around resolution for the next inflation protecting for the next three years it isn 't the opportunity to talk about the 40 split but the effect of today 's decision would be if we took the recommendation to give effect to that split more quickly than we otherwise would be able to the discussion that we 're about to have further questions I mean these percentages always been I can 't specifically answer but I can only say things we are now I mean the question is are we deciding to do this today in order to address it provides the flexibility so that future decisions could address the ratio if those future decision support of that yep Tim thank you to put the to protect against inflation so that the killing down and stays that a certain level it 's kind of like that what we 're proposing to do today is kinda like a builder dipping into deposits of houses yet to be built and we we 're dipping into what we the protection against inflation to this over of fund it 's exactly what we 're doing isn 't to wants rather than needs perhaps that 's entirely the debate were about to have paragraph four point three of the report sets out quite clearly what the implications of making this change would be Phil thanks Diane I just wanted to in your view and looking to or less the time say in terms of spending and demands on a council we 're in fact you might go into into the principal part in expect that a come aspect later because in fact there 's a time of greater need for spending things and given the demand on council for to meet other needs we did decided was probably some it should be considered cute Mike we 're not ready for 3 obviously it 's talking about the point two billion dollars per annum they will never get back so eventually over a number of years will actually see a negative impact from the decision we make today which is similar to the argument here basic saps where we shouldn 't sell them because of that 's true thank you Sarah thank you following on from its while and 're not simply giving it away though that money will be spent on things that will give their own benefit to the community in future years is that right it 's right there would have to be contestable process to decide yeah so while it 's not cash it 's going into something of value to the community that will be used over those years yes any further questions well yeah just to clarify that four point three what we 're doing is with front-loading spending so there 'll be a permanent reduction in what 's available in the future so you basically bringing forward spending that you might do in the future now because you have more needs now so there 's no difference really it 's whether you think there are more needs over the next three years and you 're willing to actually take some money from the future to pay for that the over one spend on the change it doesn 't just means you 're spending more alright since than you are in the next this is exactly the debate we 're about to have still in questions Glenn and then yawning Thank You months from the silly question Department its flatly explained in one point to that this is in response to accounts or a quest but the question simply is why why are we doing this why are we proposing I said it was a silly question so why are we proposing to do simply pointing out ramifications of whichever path we go it 's fine thank you thank you Yani I 'm just trying to understand the application process for this fund and I think the previous report talked about having kind of business cases for and yet we 've seen with crushers and said there 's a lot of stuff that 's quite high level that doesn 't seem to have had any sort of business case you know in discrete decision from counsel other than just an LTP line decision so going forward if we agree to that us how do you see the application process working this was done last time where as I understand various community boards what up okay sirs for what they thought was a fair the basis of the merits of each argument so I mean I just I wonder whether we should actually be making reference to some sort of process like first for someone like me who 's had frustration with you know the old process in terms of halls well getting funding for their school Hall and then had other schools in my area that have had no process to get funding and it 's been really people coming down the end of the table making public deputations to council that has triggered the funding reports coming back which doesn 't seem very satisfactory so you know are we able to kind of highlight a report back on the on the on the process so that we can actually have a fair you know situation where people we know what the demands or the needs are and if we agree to this then we know that there 's a robust process to allocate the funding if I might do is the previous paper dealt with those issues it said sit down and what counsel I think the food is rather prescriptive see without the paper in front of me what a recommended was that council consider proposals in the beginning of the financial year proposals for funding for the community endowment fund make decisions on they 're reviewed at a certain point of six months and if there were unallocated funds or funds that perhaps decisions wanted to be reconsidered at that point didn 't through the set of decisions were made for funding available for the subsequent period of their financial year so I think the decisions that were taken when this was considered last accounts will address those issues but for the very reasons that you 've raised yep the clarity really is that this will not be like last time in terms of community boards this will be councilors making the additional money that we 're considering taking will be a metaphore council USC so I think last time this occurred there was a quite separate process in terms of a special fund established there just by the fuel nomination replication from the community boards my understanding for this is simply that the normal process that was agreed last a decisions to be made and the way they insisted so it 's not a separate or special process it 's just enabling as you see each year there would be funds available thanks all right thank you picking four point five sorry it 's not related to the guts of their issue and later my Community Housing Trust where we 've paid a hundred thousands of our subjects right was 290 thousand is that because no houses have been yeah okay so the the Community Housing Trust money is still allocated some money as you say has been committed the second tranche of money was subject to certain things being required to be produced by no to be produced by later Latimer Community Housing Trust was still awaiting that information we 've been in touch in a week me actively with them we expect a report back by during the month of June for example one of the things was would they could they raise additional money to support the construction they 've been unable to do that we also understand that the resource consent for the location that have a decision made in June on that matter if in fact those conditions can 't_''_2398.01 be met I think the recommendation staff would be to change the decision to take the money back which doesn 't prevent that trust from seeking money in the future sometimes I think that 's a very good suggestion and Diane would agree it 's just said she agrees I think that 's really good I think tightening up some of these process it 's not gonna see to making them more restrictive but actually clarifying the processes are things that we need to do around this funding we have tried thank you so that provides clarity for everybody okay so Sara 's indicated she 's happy to move this so moved by Sara do I have a seconder seconded by Vicki and now we move into debaters there any debate on this Pauline at the same time I know that the benefit from when we did this last time the benefit was incredible we really helped things like the dispenser parks Surf Life Saving Club which is a beautiful benefit to the community a shop and you look back and and you can see that the benefit that this will give to the community for later there 's a parent and the fact that the need is now we have had an incredible disaster and even if the Beast of New Zealand has kind of forgotten we know the impact event is still with us and I think that Annette light I will support this today because I think that we really need to kick-start everything that we can and this money did benefit Thank You Sara thank you Tim thank you I 'm not gonna support this and it 's very simple this has been fantastic fund and has done a lot over the years there 's no question about it go into communities but we 've asked our ratepayers families etc to adjust their budgets their family budgets because we are putting rates at five point five percent but this council is sitting around the table saying ah but we do want to spend more because the needs now so let 's cut into the savings in reduces fund per annum to show leadership and although this and the big picture of the council funds as a small thing the principle is very strong this is a fund that has done a lot and it will be doing a lot to the needs of the future people of Christchurch we 've hit that you see say and also generation zero come to our long-term plan they 're going to be the leaders in the city and in 10 years or whenever when the needs that we have now and we are saying there are needs and there are many are going to be here in 10 years we 're not going to solve our issues and two three five or seven years so this fund is incredibly important and I think the last thing we should be doing by showing leadership is chipping away edits and principles so I would suggest and I 'm gonna vote against this and I realize that those around that are saying let 's spend it now because it 's the same as in ten years that is absolutely not because once we have done this per annum Thank You Erin and then Phil yeah I 'm like term I won 't support this I don 't believe in spending the children 's inheritance and this is what there is if I look back if you go to any inflation calculator if granddad put away a hundred dollars for you a hundred years ago that 's now one point one point well 1,800 and we took this off and 2013 and it 's going to carry on for another three years I 'm packing the council in three years time will go well we 'll just spin the inflation but then it 's not that much so on and so forth until eventually it won 't be very much money because we never inflation-proof day if granddad left you that hundred dollars that only be 100 now but if inflation proof that would be 1,800 and that 's what we 'll do this funder will just whittle down and eventually become almost worthless and that 's not what I want to live for the legacy of our city this was a gift to our city a to look at it and that 's all the sound of an se but well but do we want to blow it now or do we want to keep it for the city long term I 'm voting to keep it others can blow it that 's your choice thank him Phil and then Vickie counts as well I think part of the the deputation from Poteau Williams was really clear about the strife really that is happening for people particularly in the East who 've been most affected and I think that should tell us that remind us that in fact this this change change in the fund is to balance the the civic and community projects and if we know anything it 's at seven years later after the biggest disaster in this country 's history now is the time that people are being affected in terms of the whole psychosocial impact on their people and I think that our future generations will actually thanked us for investing in projects which will support a community development support here people and now is the time to do it there when the fant fund will grow so in effect yes I think it it 's like bringing forward spending but I think it 's a good investment there 's been some great examples of winkle kept the previous councils have done this before manuka cottage which is finally going to be developed in my ward is a good example it 's taken a long time for the people to chip away but I paid credit to the to the last count two previous council who actually put that money aside for community developments like that and that was very encouraging for the people the time and so I asked counselors now to support this one Thank You Vicki as I understand this fund it was from the sale of an Orion just some considerable time ago and I noticed that in 2012 2013 that the inflation proof element was spent we 're not actually spending the fund what we 're doing for three years when the council faces huge financial pressure is not inflation proofing that so the impact three years on it 's two hundred thousand a year this 100 what granddad lived you that for was or want to do to him that the money for was for a happy and productive life so if you had a mental health issue during that time or you had an issue with flooding or the foundations of your house needed repairing or you were affected by social isolation or all sorts of things that you wanted to do and you weren 't allowed to access that until you were 93 then granddad 's wishes would not have actually come true so I don 't buy that argument at all we are faced with major financial issues and we 've already at five point five percent in terms of a rate increase and we have seen over this week last week and we 'll see you again next week the huge demands that there are in the community that we are not meeting we 're not even meeting the housing need so the idea that we have some sacrosanct fund that we inflation-proof because in a hundred years time it will be really helpful I don 't think it 's actually right now who need assistance and who need action on various things so what we 're suggesting is that instead of the inflation proof of 1.8 million 1.7 million you read we actually are able to allocate that to really important projects over the next three years only the impact of that ongoing is 200,000 a year from three years time the huge financial pressure on this council is the next three years so I have no problem with this whatsoever I think it 's a very rational sensible thing to do Dave thank you I 'm probably going to take a similar line to Tim and Erin we seem to have a carol endowment fund that was set up with a 40 split and for me it 's disappointing I think that in their decision-making we haven 't been able to keep tabs on that 40 as we 're going along and so we 've we 've probably allocated more in one area than and here we are today trying to adjust that balance and I look back to the reporting a few moments ago the quarterly report and line however I do find it quite disturbing in some respects that there 's an organization we we still seem to mount up excesses all sorts of things and and for me it would be far more preferable for this organization to be far more fiscally responsible in their spending and balancing their books better rather than front of tinker with this sort of a thing here so we set up the spun that 's an enduring fund and it will as other speakers have said dissipate as we go into the years and and three and three years time we could feasibly make the same decision that we 're going to spend the interest and eventually this one becomes worthless that it 's just not making the money to do this so I 'm not going to support the resolution either well I wasn 't gonna speak I 'm pretty agnostic about some silly stuff talked here this simply is front-loading expenditure that 's all so you 're taking some cash from the future to spend now there is no change in the fund itself the fund is not in exactly the same way it 's got nothing to do with general council expenditures the specific fund with a specific pot of money for specific community Civic outcomes it 's really the only question you have to ask yourself is whether you think the needs are great now over the next three years compared to slightly lesser needs in the future and I think that 's really the decision we 're making here today a lot of the other stuff just doesn 't make sense okay push to push that button but I think you 've been changing my mind all the way on this so here 's where I 'm at at the moment where I 'm at at the moment is I think it comes down to what it spent on in wind so if you look at back at to 13 and 14 that was immediately in the echo of those earthquakes decisions were made in the specific projects the money went to heaven exactly panned out but I think as a housing subcommittee we have responsibility to engage with Lattimer we 're in a pretty in some parts of our city including the East that no amount of money we will give will actually bring back what they used to have so Princeton is the opening of qe2 will be fantastic and it will be akin on the journey but it won 't be the end of the journey the loss is so great you know you had to be living in those homes to know what it was like so let 's give this no amount of money we 'd give us to people will actually take them back to where they were it 's like a grief when you lose someone you don 't get them back money doesn 't get back the past I do agree with Phil that if and when we do choose to use some of this fund as proposed today we 'll the interest on it that it 's used in the area in the psychosocial areas because I think we do need to unlock some of the resources and the tools that can assist people in their journey which I think actually will be generational in terms rules because normally I wouldn 't support doing this but we are an extraordinary times and what I would like it used on is the sort of stuff that Phil 's talked about so I do support you know for three years so it 's quite situational using that thank you Thank You Jamie yeah very quickly here I guess there is that slight element that that you are cutting into something which which you won 't it won 't have in the future in the sense that if you don 't get a pay cut or pay rise in three years time you 're essentially getting a pay cut you to do to inflation kept being said the one thing that I find slightly funnier around this is that I think cause of I get rid of something that makes you money full into something that that won 't make you money and we are right now probably going to make a decision to get rid of something that does make you money and to put it under something that doesn 't make you money it is the inflation because the reason why your account slur is not always to get fixated with Christ but it 's to appreciate value the principle is remaining the same we 're not hanging in to the the overall pot it is the facial adjustment that we are we 're touching and as Rafe quickly says it is simply front-loading and they 're simply saying that they were precious today that we believe that we can put that money to good use today over the over the next couple of years there are huge pressures on us and I think that is a very small exception to make and this time to put this money to good use but I do feel a there was a sense of irony here though you know I will support it yawning thank you when the capital endowment fund was first set up I went through and analyzed all the submissions and made a graph and what was really interesting the council consulted at the time about where the money should be spent had a range of options one of the options they consider was just giving whatever amount so everyone in the city from the the sale of this Orion was to sell it and so they went sorry the council went through quite a good consultation with its community over we 've got this money what should we do with that and overwhelming feedback was to spend it in community projects that would benefit the city at the time actually sadly he could not economic projects got the priority the higher priority even though the community feed that had been that actually the community project should have been the ones that had had more funding put towards it now sadly over time what we 've seen is that a huge portion of this money has gone into economic development which actually I think you have to say has had pretty limited benefit to the city there 's a number of things through CDs the old CDC for example that were invested in there were things like tourism campaigns in Australia straight after the earthquake which actually had very little impact in terms of bringing people here because the city was actually quite broken and also events and very little has actually gone into the community projects that have had a long-standing benefit but when council made the decision previously and to go through that community board process and take the inflation adjustment and put it into those community pro projects that has had a major impact in areas and a number of councils have have raised that you know it 's not it was actually I thought quite a bold thing to do when you had a number of groups that and it wasn 't just council that had insurance issues everything under insured because we had poor valuations on it assets there 's a number of community groups that are struggling to face the rebuild costs and so we put that money back into those community projects and they have had a benefit and I guess the question for me is if not now win because we certainly have heard through the LTP the number of groups that are seeking funding from Council to do things at the same time we 've heard from people around trying to keep the rates low and the rates so actually I think it 's a good use of this money to put it back into community projects I would just caution that as it 's been said that this money doesn 't get put into the big the big events for example you know it doesn 't go it shouldn 't be going to pay for professional sports or for economic development it does I think need to go back to the community and the final thing I 'd say is that you know I think in time hopefully we can address this balance but you know we 've set up CDC and CCT into a new interstate and at the time we agree to do that the council report said we 're expected to save seven hundred and thirty thousand dollars annually and so you know if you look at this fun now most of the money is going into those two entities doing to the new entity doing the work of those two entities and it doesn 't seem to be saving money it seems to be asking for more money so I hope that balance of this fund because I do think it needs to go more into community projects but I support the resolution before us all right Mike thank you I agree obviously the money that we 're going to use is just going to front-load this but in three years time there will be a reduction on what will be given out of two hundred thousand which will go on forever until we do this again it reduces even more and so there will at some point of time be a negative impact from the decision we make today however I will support this because we do have a community in need many community groups in need and hopefully the money that actually we use and we use it wisely will actually create the value that potentially down the track will actually help reduce some of the rates and creases we 're getting if the money is invested wisely and it 's quite interesting because when we look at some of the discussions we 've had around rights sorry asset sales and the absolute no stance about that because of the is actually a little bit similar and what we 're doing here today is just touching the edge of a huge problem that we have in Christchurch with the lack of revenue we get if we truly want to be bold and actually get the city on track we actually need to look at strategic partners with some of our assets and sell some of our shares bring on a strategic partner that actually in the end give us more revenue than we 're getting right now from our assets so when we made this decision just remember the decision you 're making right now it 's actually to reduce a revenue that we 're going to give in the future which will be very similar to what we do if we sell some of our assets you know all their sisters some of the shares of the assets Tillman maintain majority but then actually get a strategic pilot which actually has potential to increase their revenue Sarah I 'll come back to you at the end I wasn 't gonna comment no I will the comparison with asset sales this as a comparison with an asset sale at all I think all we 're doing is taking a if you were gonna put it into the equivalent of a company the pacers dividends to reduce rates where the company has a capital value and where the company pays a dividend all we 're doing is structuring that company to pay a higher dividend now and foregoing and rather than investing more into that company so it 's not the equivalent of an asset sale it 's simply taking a higher dividend now and avoiding reinvestment for future growth into the company I am also deliberately going to separate out any discussion about how we might use the fund because that 's a separate set of decision decisions as we 've heard and of course there 's been quite a bit of comment about the way that this fund was set up and the reasons for it but the reality is that the fund was set up and the dividends from the fund the interest from the fund delivers outcomes for our community we 've sat here for a number about needs in our community and aspirations of our community some of which we know we 're not going to be able to fund and a lot of those are earthquake related and we are a number of years on from the earthquake and some of them are around because of calls on our funding in recent years because of the earthquake so we are in a unique situation and I think if there was a time for us to look at doing what we 're looking at doing through this recommendation now is that time I had a lot of respect for the decisions that were made in the 13 and 14 years and I 've seen some of the good results from that Phil referred to manuka cottage I 'm certainly aware of what the bird link community center has done for that community and a community which has grown significantly as a result of the earthquakes as well if there was a time to do this that time is now I am supportive of this and I don 't believe it 's our job to speculate on that council would agree to do this for a longer period or whether it wouldn 't obviously the longer period for which it was done and the greater the effect on the future of the fund would be but that 's a decision for a future Council at that time in terms of the decision that 's in front of us today I believe that this is absolutely the right thing for us to be doing at this time not least because of what we 've heard in the last few days through submitters the long term plan all we 're doing is taking a greater level of support from this fund now in order for it to have a small reduction in the future in exactly the same way that if we structured one of our companies to do this we would be taking greater dividend now to avoid reinvesting in the company at this particular time for its future growth Sara Christchurch has been having a pretty rainy day for the last seven years I 'm not going to go over everything that 's already been see but this fund that we 're really talking about here at a time when we 're hearing from so many groups that need our help facilities such as the Multicultural Center at Hagley college or a community pool in each we may be able to access some of this funding an ED value in a social and community way rather than having the cash on hand councillor Q and liking this to a child 's inheritance yet holding on to the money while the children are starving seems completely counterproductive and it 's remember that we 're not actually parceling out any of the money today simply allowing people to apply for it and if we have worthy projects we 'll have the debate then as to whether we allocate the money or not this decision today isn 't one to be playing games with or to be green standing on every vote is going to count this vote needs 80% to pass so if you are ambivalent if you are 50 on this and if you are thinking about voting against us your vote will count and will make a headlines please think again this is for our communities communities that are currently coming to us asking for funding so that they can add community value to add social value to increase mental health and well-being in their local communities I dodged counselors to support this and to enable our communities to apply for funding to meet the demands that we have now thank you and Sara I 'm pleased that you pointed out the fact that this vote will need 80% support to carry that means if four people were to vote against the vote would be lost so having noted that all those in favor please say aye aye against with those people who voted no please raise their hands okay can we have that recorded please and that 's carried thank you [Applause] okay so that 's the end of the open part of the meeting so I will now move that we exclude that 's our move to exclude the public as set out on pages 31 to 33 of the agenda and pages 5 6 of the supplementary agenda so Pauline you 'll second there _"

    "text": "it thank you so then moving on to item 7 the capital endowment fund so we 've got the same team remaining at the table for this one thank you so questions first of all and noting in the report we 've got obviously the discussion around the 40 split but also with the note that all over the fund was able to be applied is is currently spoken for would the resolution of the staff recommendation today mean that we would then be able to apply additional funds to give effect to the 40 split whereas at the moment we 're not able to do that because the fund is already expended so that the effect of this essentially if we were to take the staff recommendation would be to give effect to that previous decision we made about the 40 split yep so the discussion today is around resolution one whether we utilize all income and not inflation proofing for the next inflation protecting for the next three years it isn 't the opportunity to talk about the 40 split but the effect of today 's decision would that split more quickly than we otherwise would be able to so I think that 's quite a good way of framing the discussion that we 're about to have further questions pulling are and the innovation economic development in environment category was none in the Civic and community category in some wondering how did we get to that point do we not allocate on our 40 ratio as we go along no staff make a recommendation but counselors make their decisions so there may not necessary it 's some of this is quite old I mean these these percentages have always been there I can 't specifically answer but I can only say same as we are now that we do give advice on I mean the question is are we deciding to do this today in order to address that we 're not doing this to the problem we 're simply saying it provides the flexibility so that future decisions could address the ratio if those future decisions supported that yep Tim thank you we see this up to put the to protect against inflation so that the kind of like that what we 're proposing to do today is kinda like a builder dipping into deposits of houses yet to be built isn 't it we we 're dipping into what we the protection against inflation to this overall fund it 's exactly what we 're doing isn 't adjusting the capital down but over a period of three years at which point you would then continue on to inflation-adjusted well we 've given white to wants rather than needs perhaps think that 's entirely the debate were about to have paragraph four point three of the report sets out quite clearly what the implications of making this change would mean Phil thanks Diane I just wanted to in your view and looking at all or less the time say in terms of spending and demands on a council when in fact you might go into into the principal part in expect that a comes back later because in fact at the time of greater need for spending things and given the demand on council for to meet other needs we did decide it was probably something points three obviously it 's talking about the point two billion dollars to get back so eventually over a number of years will actually see a negative impact from the decision we make today which is a little bit similar to the argument here that Essex labs where we we shouldn 't sell them because of the MPEG will get later on that 's truth Thank You Sara thank you feel like I 'm from its while um the money won 't be in the fund anymore we 're not simply giving it away though that money will be spent on things that will give your own benefit to the community in future years is that right that 's right there would have to be contestable process to decide yeah so while it 's not cash it 's going into something of value to the community that will be used over those years yes any further questions yeah just to clarify that four point three what we 're doing is with front-loading spending so there 'll be a permanent reduction in what 's available in the future so you basically now because you have more needs now so there 's no difference really it 's whether you think there are more needs over the next three years and you 're willing to actually take some money from the future to pay for that the overall spend on the change it doesn 't just means you 're spending more than all right since than you are in the nest this is exactly the debate we 're about to have so back to Sara and then Glen clear okay so still in questions Glen and then yawning Thank You months from the silly question Department has flatly explained in 1.2 that this is in response to accounts or requests but the question simply is why why are we doing this why are we proposing I said it was a silly question so why are we proposing to do should you decide not to accept it is yourselves you simply pointing out our ramifications of whichever path we go it 's fine thank you thank you Yanni I 'm just trying to understand the application process for this fund and I think the and yet we 've seen with crushers and Zed there 's a lot of stuff that 's quite high level that doesn 't seem to have had any sort of business case you know in discrete decision from counsel other than just an LTP line decision so going forward how do you see the application I mean I just I wonder whether we should actually be making reference to some sort of process like first for someone like me who 's had frustration with you know the old process in terms of halls will getting funding for their school Hall and then had other schools in my area that have had no process to get funding and it 's been really people coming down the end of the table making public deputations to council that has triggered the funding reports coming back which doesn 't seem very satisfactory so you know are we able to kind of highlight a report back on the on the on the process so that we can actually have a fair you know situation where people we know what the demands or the needs are there 's a robust process to allocate the funding if I might do is the previous paper dealt with those issues set sit down what can 't_''_562.36 so I think the food rather prescriptive city recommendations what the process should be just in summary without the paper in front of me what a recommended was that council consider proposals at the beginning of the financial year proposals for funding for the community endowment fund make decisions on their review to the second point of six months and if there were unallocated funds of funds that perhaps decisions wanted to be reconsidered at that point in a further set of decisions were made for the funding available for the subsequent period of their financial year so I think the decisions that were taken when this was considered last it counts will address those issues but for the very reasons that you 've raised the clarity really is that this will not be like last time in terms of community boards this will be councilors make the additional money that we 're considering taking will be a metaphor Council yeah I see quite separate process in terms of a special fund established there was as usages by if you will nomination replication from the community boards my understanding for this is simply that the normal process that was agreed last time would apply this is simply releasing money to enable a decisions to be made in the way Diane suggested so it 's not a separate or special process it 's just enabling as you see each year there would be funds available thanks all right thank you picking high and four point five sorry it 's not related to the guts of their issue and letter my Community Housing Trust where we 've paid a hundred thousands of subjects right was 290 thousand is that because no houses have been okay so the Community Housing Trust money is still allocated some money as you say has been committed the second tranche of money was to certain things being required to be produced by know to be produced by letter 11 of Community Housing Trust was still waiting that information we 've been untouched and a weak me actively with them expect example one of the things was would they could they raise additional money to support the construction they 've been unable to do that we also understand that the resource of consent for the location that they 've got expires in June so we expect to have a decision made in June on that matter if in fact those conditions currently meet that the recommendation staff would be to change the decision to take the money back which doesn 't prevent that trust from seeking money in the future sometimes I think that 's a very good suggestion and Diane would agree it 's just said she agrees I think that 's very good I think tightening up some of these process it 's not listening to making them more restrictive but actually clarifying the processes are things that we need to do around this funding we have tried thank you so much clarity for everybody okay so Sara 's indicated she 's happy to move this so moved by Sara do I have a seconder secondly by Vickie and now we move into debaters there any debate on this from when we did this last time the benefit was incredible we really helped things like the Spencer parks Surf Life Saving Club which is a beautiful benefit to the community now social enterprise and my ho there they opened up a shop and you look back and and you can see that the benefit that this will give to the community for later there 's a parent and effect that the need is now we have had an incredible disaster and even if the Beast of New Zealand has kind of forgotten we know the impact event is still with us and I think that a net light I will support this today because I think that we really need to kick-start everything that we can and this money did benefit Thank You Sara thank you Tim thank you I 'm not gonna support this and it 's very simple this has been a fantastic fund and has done a lot over the years there 's no question about it go into communities but we 've asked our ratepayers families etc to adjust their budgets their family budgets because this council is sitting around the table say ah but we do want to spend more because the needs now so will it 's cut into the savings in reduces fund per annum by 200,000 the fact of the matter is we have to show leadership and although this and the big picture of the council funds as a small thing that principle is very strong this is a fund that has done a lot and it will be doing a lot to the needs of the future people of Christchurch we 've hit that you see si and also generation zero come to our long-term plan they are going to be the leaders in the city and in ten years of whenever when the needs that we have now and we are saying there are needs and there are many are going to be here in ten years we 're not going to solve our issues and two three five or seven years so this fund is incredibly important and I think the last thing we should be doing by showing leadership is chipping away edits and principle so this and I realize there are those around that are saying let 's spend it now because it 's the same as in ten years that is absolutely not because once we have done this this fund will be down by two hundred thousand dollars per annum Thank You Erin and then Phil yeah I 'm like term I won 't support this I don 't believe in spending the children 's inheritance and this is what that is if I look back if you go to any inflation calculator if Green Day put away a hundred dollars for you a hundred years ago that 's now one point one point well 1,800 and we took this off and 2013 and it 's going to carry on for another three years I 'm packing the council in three years time will go well we 'll just spin the inflation but then it 's not that much so on and so forth until eventually it won 't be very much money because we never inflation-proof day if granddad left you that hundred dollars that would only be 100 now but if what we 'll do this fund will just whittle down and eventually become almost worthless and that 's not what I want to live for the legacy of our city this was a gift to our city a number of years ago and or a windfall however you want to look at it and that 's all the sound of an essay but well but do we want to blow it now or do we want to keep it for the city long team I 'm voting to keep it others can blower that 's your choice Thank You Phil and then Vicky council I think part of the the deputation from Poteau Williams was really clear about the strife really that is happening for people particularly in the East who 've been most affected and I think that should tell us that remind us that in fact the this this change change in the fund is to balance that the Civic and community projects and if we know anything it 's at seven years later after the biggest disaster in this country 's history now is the time that impact on their people and I think that our future generations will actually thanked us for investing in projects which will support our community development support here people and now is the time to do it there 'll be a time and two of course when that when the fund will grow so in effect yes I think it it 's like bringing forward screaming but I think it 's a good investment there 's been some great examples of wind count the previous councils have done this before manuka cottage which is finally going to be developed in my ward is a good example it 's taken a long time for the people to chip away but I paid credit to the to the last count to previous council who actually put that money as side for community developments like that and that was very encouraging for the people at the time and so I asked counselors now to support this one Thank You Vicki as I understand his fund it was from the sale of an Orion and I noticed that in 2012 2013 that the inflation proof what we 're doing for three years when the council faces huge financial pressure is not inflation proofing it so the impact three years on there 's 200,000 a year let 's just take granddad 's inheritance because if Grant had left you 100 what granddad lived you that four was or want to do to him that the money for was for a happy and productive life so if you had a mental health issue during that time or you had an issue with flooding or the foundations of your house needed repairing or you were affected by social isolation or all sorts of things that you wanted to do and you weren 't allowed to access that until you were 93 then granddad 's wishes would not have actually come true so I don 't buy that argument at all we are faced with major financial issues and we 've already at 5.5 percent in terms of a rate increase and we have seen over this week last week and we 'll see you again next week the huge demands that there are in the community that we need so the idea that we have some sacrosanct fund that we inflation-proof because in a hundred years time it will be really helpful I don 't think it 's actually with that good or useful to the people of Christchurch right now who need assistance and who need action on various things so what we 're suggesting is that instead of the inflation-proof with 1.8 million one depending on which burger you read we actually are able to allocate that to really important projects over the next three years only the impact of that ongoing is 200,000 a year from three years time the huge financial pressure on this council is the next three years so I have no problem with this whatsoever I think it 's a very rational sensible thing to do Dave thank you on probably going to take a similar line to Tim and Erin we seem to have a carol endowment fund that was set up with a 40 split and for me it 's disappointing I think that in their decision-making we haven 't been able to keep tabs on that 40 as probably allocated more in one area than another and here we are today trying to adjust that balance back to the reporting a few moments ago the quarterly report and Diane mentioned she was pleased with bringing their expenditure into line however I do find it quite disturbing in some respects that as an organization we we still seem to mount up excesses over spending and budgeting for all sorts of things and and for me it would be far more preferable for this organization to be far more fiscally responsible in their spending and balancing their books better rather than trying to tinker with this sort of a thing here so we set up the spun that 's an enduring fund and it will as other speakers have said dissipate as we go into the years and and three and three years time we could feasibly make the same decision that we 're going to spend the interest and eventually this one becomes worthless that it 's just not making the money to do this so I 'm not going to support the resolution either well I wasn 't I 've heard some silly stuff talked here this simply is front-loading expenditure that 's all so you 're taking some cash from the future to spend now there is no change in the fund itself the fund is not going to dissipate the fund that 's going to be managed in exactly the same way it 's got nothing to do with general council expenditures the specific funds with a specific pot of money for specific community Civic outcomes it 's really the only question you have to ask yourself is whether you think the needs are great now over the next three years compared to slightly lesser needs in the future and I think that 's really the decision we 're making here today a lot of the other stuff just doesn 't make sense okay but I think you 've been changing my mind all the way on this so here 's where I 'm at at the moment where I 'm at at the moment is I think it comes down to what it 's spent on in wind so if you look at back at those earthquakes decisions were made in the specific projects the money went to haven 't exactly panned out but I think as a housing subcommittee we have a responsibility to engage with let ma [Music] we 're in a pretty difficult space as a community the grip is so profound in some parts of our city including the East that no amount of money we will give will actually bring back what they used to have so for instance the opening of the qe2 will be fantastic and it will be akin on the journey but it won 't be the end of the journey the loss is so great you know you had to be living in those homes to know what it was like so let 's get this no amount of money we give us to people will actually take them back to where they were it 's like a grief when you lose someone you don 't get them back money doesn 't get back the past I do agree with Phil that if and when we do choose to use some of this fund as 's used in the area in the psychosocial areas because I think we do need to unlock some of the resources and the tools that can assist people in their journey which I think actually will be generational in terms of recovery so I am going to break my own rules because normally I wouldn 't support doing this but we are an extraordinary times and what I would like it used on is the sort of stuff that Phil 's talk about so I do support you know for three years so it 's quite situational using that thank you Thank You Jamie yeah very quickly yeah I guess there is that slight element that that you are cutting into something which which you won 't it won 't have in the future in the sense that if you don 't get a pay cut or pay rise in three years time you 're essentially getting a pay cut due to due to inflation that being said the one thing that I find slightly funnier at around this is that I think cause of I get rid of something 't make you money and we are right now probably going to make a decision to get rid of something that does make you money and to end to put it under something that doesn 't make you money it is the inflation component though and the reason why I 'm supporting this is because the reason why you 're a counselor is not always to get fixated with Christ but it 's to appreciate value the principle is remaining the same we 're not hanging in to the the overall pot it is the flash and adjustment that we are we 're touching and as Rafe correctly says it is simply front-loading and there 's simply saying that they were precious today that we believe that we can put their money to good use today over the over the next couple of years there are huge pressures on us and I think that is a very small exception to make and this time to put this money to good use but I do feel there 's a sense of irony here though you know I will support it yawning up I went through and analyzed all the submissions and made a graph and what was really interesting the council consulted at the time about where the money should be spent had a range of options one of the options they consider was just giving people you know fifty dollars each across the city or whatever amount so everyone in the city from the the sale of this Orion was to sell it and so they went sorry the council went through quite a good consultation with its community over we 've got this money what should we do with that and overwhelming for that was to spend and community projects that would benefit the city at the time actually sadly he could not economic projects got the priority the higher priority even though the community feed that had been that actually the community project should have been the ones that had had more funding put towards it now sadly over time what we 've seen is that a huge portion of this money has gone into economic development which actually I think you 'd have to say has had of things through CDs the old CDC for example that were invested in there were things like tourism campaigns in Australia straight after the earthquake which actually had very little impact in terms of bringing people here because the city was actually quite broken and also we 've seen huge money go into golf and sporting events and very little has actually gone into the community projects that have had a long-standing benefit but when council made the decision previously and to go through that community board process and take the inflation adjustment and put it into those community pro projects that has had a major impact in areas and a number of councils have have raised that you know it 's not it was actually I thought quite a bold thing to do when you had a number of groups that and it wasn 't just Council that had insurance issues everything under insured because we had poor valuations on it assets there 's a number of community groups that are struggling to face the rebuild costs and so we put that money back into those community projects and for me is if not now win because we 'd certainly have heard through the LTP the number of groups that are seeking funding from council to do things at the same time we 've heard from people around trying to keep the rates low and the issue with that is that this money is not from rates so actually I think it 's a good use of this money to put it back into community projects I would just caution that as has been said that this money doesn 't get put into the big the big events for example you know it doesn 't go it shouldn 't be going to pay for professional sport or for economic development it does I think need to go back to the community and the final thing I 'd say is that you know I think in time hopefully we can address this balance but you know we 've set up CDC and CCT into a new industry and at the time we agreed to do that the council report said we 're expected to save seven hundred and thirty thousand this fun now most of the money is going into those two entities doing to the new entity doing the work of those two entities and it doesn 't seem to be saving money it seems to be asking for more money so I hope that we can address that in time in terms of the balance of this fund because I do think it needs to go more into community projects but I support the resolution before us all right Mike thank you I agree obviously the money that we 're going to use it 's just going to front-load this but in three years time there will be a reduction on what will be given out of two hundred thousand which will go on forever until we do this again that reduces even more and so there will at some point of time be a negative impact from the decision we make today however I will support this because we do have a community in need many community groups in need and hopefully the money that actually we use and we use it wisely will actually create the some of the rates and creases we 're getting if the money is invested wisely and it 's quite interesting because when we look at some of the discussions we 've had around rights sorry asset sales and the absolute know starts about that because of the fact it will dip into income for future generations this is actually a little bit similar and what we 're doing here today is just touching the edge of a huge problem that we have in Christchurch with the lack of revenue we get if we truly want to be bold and actually get the city on track we actually need to look at strategic partners with some of our and sell some of our shares and bring on a strategic pan over actually in the end give us more revenue than we 're getting right now from our assets so when we made this decision just remember the decision you 're making right now is actually to reduce a revenue that we 're going to give in the future which will be very similar to what we do if we sell some the shares of the assets Tillman maintain majority but then actually get a strategic planner which actually has potential to increase their revenue Sarah I 'll come back to you at the end I wasn 't kind of comment no I will the comparison with asset sales is an interesting one because I certainly wouldn 't see this as a comparison with an asset sale at all I think all we 're doing is taking a if you were going to put it into the equivalent of a company the pacers dividends to reduce rates where the company has a capital value and where the company pays a dividend all we 're doing is structuring that company to pay a higher dividend now and for going and rather than investing more into that company so it 's not the equivalent of an asset sale it 's simply taking a higher dividend now and avoiding reinvestment for future growth into the company I am also deliberately going to separate out any discussion about how we might use the fund because that 's a separate set of decision decisions as we 've of comment about the way that this fund was set up and and the reasons for it but the reality is that the fund was set up and the dividends from the fund the interest from the fund delivers outcomes for our community we 've sat here for a number of days through long-term plan submissions and we 've heard about needs in our community and aspirations of our community some of which we know we 're not going to be able to fund and a lot of those are earthquake related and we are a number of years on from the earthquake and some of them are around because of calls on our funding in recent years because of the earthquake so we are in a unique situation and I think if there was a time for us to look at doing what we 're looking at doing through this recommendation now is that time I had a lot of respect for the decisions that were made in the 13 and 14 years and I 've seen some of the good results from that Phil referred to manuka cottage community center has done for that community and a community which has grown significantly as a result of the earthquakes as well if there was a time to do this that time is now I am supportive of this and I don 't believe it 's our job to speculate on what a future Council 's decision might be as to whether that council would agree to do this for a longer period or whether it wouldn 't obviously the longer period for which it was done and the greater the effect on the the future of the fund would be but that 's a decision for a future council at that time in terms of the decision that 's in front of us today I believe that this is absolutely the right thing for us to be doing at this time not least because of what we 've heard in the last few days through submitters the long-term plan all we 're doing is taking a greater level of support from this fund now in order for it to have a small reduction in the future in exactly the to do this we would be taking greater dividend now to avoid reinvesting in the company at this particular time for his future growth Sarah and basically and there 's no doubt that Christchurch has been having a pretty rainy day for the last seven years I 'm not going to go over everything that 's already been said but let 's remember that it 's the community aspect of this fund that we 're really talking about here at a time when we 're hearing from so many groups that need our help facilities such as the Multicultural Center at Hagley college or a community pool in Edgware may be able to access some of this funding and add value in a social and community way rather than having the cash on hand councillor q and liking this to a child 's inheritance yet holding on to the money while the children are starving seems completely counterproductive and let 's remember that we 're not actually parceling out any of the money today simply allowing people to apply for it and if we have worthy projects we 'll have or not this decision today isn 't one to be playing games with or to be green standing on every vote is going to count this vote needs 80% to pass so if you are ambivalent if you are 50 on this and if you are thinking about voting against us your vote will count and will make a difference if you are doing that to grandstand or gain headlines please think again this is for our communities communities that are currently coming to us asking for funding so that they can add community value to add social value to increase mental health and well-being in their local communities I 'd urge councillors to support this in to enable our communities to apply for funding to meet the demands that we have now thank you and Sarah I 'm pleased that you pointed out the fact that this vote will need 80% support to carry that means if four people were to vote against the vote would be lost so having noted that all those in favor please say aye aye against with those people who voted no please raise that 's carried thank you _"

    "text": "item three item 3.1 the public forum and it 's my pleasure this morning to welcome Porter Williams the MP for Christchurch East what are good to have you with us this morning welcome you have five minutes to address the council and thank you very much indeed for joining us acknowledge behind me I 've got a team from just to see too much of your time I know you 're busy I 've been the local Member of Parliament for Christchurch eats for about five years and the last two and a half three years or so I 've produced a report that lists my activity and the report showed that about 5% of the work that my office deals with is actually within the council jurisdiction you know drains rubbish breaches of consents and the like so it 's quite a significant amount of work that we do to support our council I work with officials directly and with staff sometimes with councillors and community board members but the way that I work is actually to hold my line until I get a result um on a of Shirley in Richmond myself and Mike Davidson and the space of about an hour so meet with six individuals and families to discuss a variety of issues that I have brought to you today you have a copy of the documents that the residents gave me on that day and I hope you take the opportunity to read it and makes for compelling reading they talkin the various submissions about a lack of repair like a repair of drains of roads of footpaths that are impossible of trip hazards in general neglect and they also talk how they are impacted by the widening of drains due to the flopped and flooding in how they 've been treated by officials in and contractors I meet with three households directly one woman who 's on this beautiful property she 's across the creek from the contractors she suffers from the movement of machinery from the dumping of material during the day and then at night she has she 's got to put up with the sound of generators and pumps disturbing Huson her space she 's actually also got to mitigate it I heard from another family whose driveway has had to be carved out to widen a drain they argued with council officials for five months that she would not be able to get her vehicles in and out of her garage five months it took five minutes for an official to go down there and try attempt to put her car into the garage to realize that they 've made a mistake and I had to actually do something about the plans they argued for five months there was another I didn 't actually meet the person but a situation where a guy has not had access through his driveway to his property for the best part of a year and has to cross the creek across a scaffold platform which is completely inappropriate and I was shocked by what I saw but what was even more shocking was when I went to a citizenship ceremony that evening and spoke to a counselor about what I 'd seen that day I got from that counselor and I 'm paraphrasing that the East has had more than its fair share been stewing about it ever since I was not expecting to head as expressed in such a blasian way and perhaps that counselor Sita Sita to me doesn 't really realize how bad at us and doesn 't mean realize how bad that statement was I believe such as the negative bias that has gone on unchallenged about the east and I 'm here to remind you that as elected representatives you have to get rid of your negative East viced editors and change your frame of reference you are about to embark upon an allocation of resource and belong to plan and you need to lose a lens of equity of immunity for all citizens so that the citizens of the East suburbs can have access to the same amenities at the same level as anyone else in the city if I think about the residents that I met that I sent you the information on they are making sacrifices for the benefit of the whole city and in particular the residents of flopped and basin and they deserve to be treated with respect and kindness what you as at your disposal and discretion attitudes that are expressed by councillors permeate to the officials who write the reports that you use to base your decisions on and they permeate to staff and their dealings with the public I implore you to read the material I see you and see it for what it is it 's a specific case about a specific neighborhood but it 's also representative of the inequity that we experience across the suburbs of the east I implore you to embark upon a community roadshow to see and hear from locals what their concerns are and how we feel we have been treated this is a small microcosm of what the issues in the eastern suburbs are but it 's representative of the way we feel we have been treated and had our views and wishes for our communities dismissed we need to do this together I congratulate the councillors and the community board members from the eastern suburbs and I now see how big your challenge is that you face to get our projects across the line I 'm here to support your efforts the city and we deserve a fair allocation of resource to ensure that we can move on from the quakes we didn 't cause the quakes but we continue to be impacted by them and council has a vital role in helping us to recovery to the same level as anyone else in the city please treat us with fear and ensure that we have an equitable allocation to support the things that we need to help our communities thrive thank you and thank and thank you very much for coming along and raising these matters this morning and thanks also for your offer of support it 's important that we we work together to resolve these issues unaware of a body of work which is going on through the community board I 'm also aware of some communications which have been handled through our communications team in recent days but there are certainly some good suggestions that some that have been made in your presentation this morning we 'll read the papers which have been supplied with interest and if that leads on to further conversations and further work a very useful exercise so thank you very much indeed once again for joining us this morning Kiera _"

    "text": "and going well for time and I wanted to flag that the strategic priority of emplou improved waterways I don 't believe it 's reflected well enough and the infrastructure strategy particular around storm water and wastewater so I know that even Smith from the 800 taco network this has quite length around underfunding well that the proposed investment options for both storm water and wastewater are the medium investment options whereas I would support the high investment option for both was wastewater and storm water to meet that to meet it strategic priority of improved waterways I don 't think it 's acceptable for waste water overflows to be predicted to be increasing in the future you know in other words I think we should be aiming to at least maintain reduced waste water overflows and I do understand that with climate change and with earthquake recovery it is our infrastructure is struggling and I understand that but I think that we shouldn 't we need we should value the investment they were putting in now for the future and possibly postpone investments such as a large covered stadium future LTPS a climate impact statement to accompany the LTP I don 't know if it 's something that 's been raised by others before so that would be a statement they look at accounting around the different key options in the LTP so that both people who are providing submissions and counsellors can make informed decisions around the climate impacts alongside the financial numbers you have input information about what would this mean for both mitigation of climate change and adaptation in this coming as part of the zero carbon act I 'd I don 't know but it 's something that could be a common commonplace occurrence so now to a submission point about the iPhone attack or River corridor I believe that the LTP should contain funding from next year for the regeneration Christchurch planning process so I think a few others most submitted on this point that the policy that we do at Christchurch plan will be finalized in the next few months and I don 't believe there 's anything tagged specifically in the LTP for that master planning to be implemented by the City Council and our the many other parties will be putting in contributing towards initiatives within the red zone but this should be I see the City Council could play a strong role in seed funding of initiatives that in the future will both reduce the cost to the council for that red zone area but also lead to a lot of economic development and I have put in a nominal figure of 20 million for a contestable fund for the red zone for long-term uses and 250,000 per year for next few years for transitional uses so those that have less than five years so I 'm a local resident of the Shirley Richland area and I 've put in as a submission point around the shirley community center which has I know also been discussed by quite a few people when submissions already I support a local resident who has come up with an apropos zl-- to move the current shirley library facilities to the Shirley Community Center site the reason for their lease to scope the feasibility of that the reason being that I do see that the the palms are looking at expanding that the occurrence footprint and now really keen to acquire that library site so I I could imagine that the Shirley library could be moved to the Shirley Community Center site with developed facilities extended facilities and if a win-win for both the palms and for the community yeah so I would support at least some feasibility funding around it or for South staff to spend time to continue to investigate these options I understand that there are a lot of community facilities in this area and it is complex and finally my last point is around roading in Northwest Richmond Richmond which is the W Creek Works area so after living in this area I have seen that we expected the roads to be replaced I think this current year or next year in the in the previous LTP it was budgeted to be revenues for warden Street which I live on Stapleton 's Road Nicholls Street and I believe the only reason these roads identified as being very rough in needing replacement the only reason that they haven 't been replaced was which area these were going to take which route these were going to take and so under skirts they weren 't able to be repaired and now they 've been delayed because of the deadly create works for people further upstream in basin and just putting in a plea to please please respect I think they if you look at Christchurch map of road condition thank you yeah no it 's huge so under my personal submission yeah has anyone got any questions okay Sophie I don 't know if you 've read the latest Productivity Commission report it suggests actually that all businesses won 't have to do carbon impact accounting though and yannick so if you can I just ask you about you were suggesting about the climate change impact statement but there could be part of your plan see I guess what part of the reason we haven 't gone too strong on there is because we would also like central government advice around potential climate change so does it I 'm just wondering were you still wanting us so and think will be useful to have have is that what you had in mind yes I understand it wouldn 't be for mini there 's so much detail on the plan it would only be for a few key options that have be identified as having playing quite a large role in water our emissions either would be or adaptation for the city and no it 's know that some it 's just how much like it 's we can include because we haven 't got all the information yet especially from central government yes so I 'm not I haven 't looked into what thank you yeah II um just two quick questions one is um in other parts on another part of the city we 've we 've got the library and the mall actually in the mall and what we found is that 's really led to a huge increase in usage is that something I mean you 've talked about selling off the lay into the mall so they can expand but have you considered the idea that we would you know actually just incorporate it into the mall redevelopment at the it 's just right alongside it I think it wouldn 't be very far away just down the road it wouldn 't stop people from very close together and the second question is you you haven 't mentioned anything about funding for the Heathkit Rover so you 've talked about the Ivan attacker Oregon have you got any thoughts about whether we should look at putting some funding towards environmental enhancement of the healthcare yes I think there 's a stormwater management plan the reason I said bit on the iPhones because I am more aware of what 's happening through my role I 'm a volunteer with the air attack or any work on the strategic steering group yeah clean the right tires but just one just over planting trees and much of that residential red zone area would you have a particular view on you know collaboration over this or how it might be undertaken or you know in terms of that there 's a carbon sink yes don 't underestimate how much work it takes to to replant right and after so we can water 's Trust 't open stream restoration projects it is very easy to get people to plant it 's very hard to get people to do the maintenance afterwards and I think that needs to be thought through carefully i medicating for a multi-use Park not just so the green spine obviously will have a lot of regeneration but there could be a lot of wet watery land infrastructure that makes should be easier what you can do in the big city area for example is if you 're doing with the stock banks is that you 'll get natural salt marsh regeneration without having to plant and preach it 's my opinion so thinking smart about you know the salt marsh habitat is already there and you can just expand it and you have that natural seed source there will be a lot leus work then yeah we 'll always be infestations of weeds yeah but it 's still worthwhile doing it 's lovely thank you very much and much appreciate your time and in making all of those submissions on behalf of the different groups and you were right to separate that way so yeah neutrally reinforcing thanks very much all right well I 'm going to adjourn this meeting there until Saturday the 12th of may attend a seawall on Saturday _"

    "text": "them okay so now for working waters trust we 're on the projects manager so we 're a freshwater Conservation Trust that works throughout Canterbury Otago and Southland on restoration education advocacy for our waterways in particularly for three certain species of fish I 'd like to touch on a point around and virus schools Canterbury or the Tuamotu foundation they are a partner organization who we work with on a few projects and they have always been very very very supportive and very professional in their work and I would say that they have a very high quality of association with the schools they have a lot of support and I know that they have been advocating for more funding through the City Council or the work they do so increased funding but also for a longer term funding agreement so that they can provide security to facilitators and provide that service to the schools that they I know there 's a waiting list of quite a few schools so yeah there might be others were submitted in this point as well next point was around the waterways ecology initially had a funding had 1 million dollars of funding per annum when it was initiated and in the current LTP for the first year they 're looking at a 67 percent reduction and their funding from when its initial labour when it was first brought in or a 15 percent reduction compared to last year 's funding working what his trust believes that this is a bit short-sighted to reduce the funding when one of the strategic priorities of the City Council is to improve waterways and this is the improvement what a quality improvement fund and I do believe that I know there 's a lot of funding going towards storm water and wastewater initiatives but sometimes they they might have indirect benefits waterways but this is the fee fund for direct benefits to improving waterways next point you know in aligned with the bit fund is the community would have partnership funding that was proposed by the natural heritage team within CCC this is currently it is listed in a service plan for potential in the future but currently has no funding assigned and 1 million per would like to show our support for funding for that program at the 1 million dollars per year level and that 's because we 've seen there are quite it 's quite clear evidence from around the world particularly Portland Oregon where we you get communities communities involved in stopping contaminants at the source it 's a very cost effective way to today improvements and so we 're spending a lot of money in the city on stormwater so 1 million per year and actually working on stopping the city the stopping the contaminants that source actually makes a lot of sense it also plays into the role of also the community outcome of stronger communities because it 's empowering communities to look after to take responsibility for this issue ourselves and there are quite a few groups we can go to trust in another trust that would like to play a role in helping to make that happen it 's probably all for any questions around working waters Chester yes Pauline and then Aaron Yanni they so can you tell us did they see that the similar type program yes so that they provided incentives for taking so that they have a slightly slightly different problem that these stormwater in wastewater are combined so they 're really time to take that peak off the storm waters it 's quantity issue as well as quality but they have worked on quality issues as well and you said you say you have a different type in the community using using the community groups to provide engagement around the issues so we 'll see quite a sizable education component you 've still in these evidence that they 've worked yes I believe to the crowd at the club ableton from the CCC has presented to us on it on their evidence okay I 'm sorry there was Aaron and then Yomi yes so just two questions around the water one is I know a lot of people are quite concerned about carbon I 'm actually more concerned about plastic in the ocean and in our waterways and you support the funding for cleaning up the waterways and things if you 've got any points to make on that I can 't seem least something plastic every meter or two which is incredibly unfortunate stop try and stop the pollution to the source rather than trying to stop it when it 's already in the ocean and it is around education working on efficacy with supermarkets it 's already happening the zero waste movement to change how we package and so your urine favorite seems even moving towards us not even using plastic anywhere in the future yes yes yeah seems to be the way it 's going yeah we 'll take a while to get there but once there 's no fish left and then the other one was around storm water at the source so do you think the council should be because it 's not necessarily in your submission because we didn 't really ask the questions but around well I think a rebate system to encourage people to put in rainwater tanks because of it just their sheer volume of storm water have you got any comments on on that is a system would you have a better system governance and incentives for industry to to paint new roads already I 'm not an expert on the storm water system here but I believe it was more of a quality issue rather than the quantity issue yeah Jonnie and then thank you thank you for submission other submitters who you probably haven 't heard or seen have commented on the fact that if we 're doing the dredging in the river or the Woolston car that we should take more out there kind of concerned at a low level of sediment that we 're removing have we 've also been advised that you know there 's contaminants and in it that we 're leaving insight so have you got any thoughts around I don 't know if you 've considered the dredging and the flood mitigation but any thoughts or unimprovable equality as we do that or while we do that I think you need to do safe disposal those sediments you were raising the point about the safe disposal of those well basically um you 're talking about the water quality and you 've mentioned the shortfall in the budget throw them Jonah 's program for example we we can actually take more add more of the sediment out but one of the issues is it 's got asbestos on up which we 're actually leaving and for future generations and I just wonder whether you think we should look at while we 're doing work along that river channel which we obviously have more digging to go along the heath go is there accurate more of a focus sorry is it sorry I mean you can 't say something like that and a question to a submitter I mean I hope I don 't have any advice on that in front of me pissed off some similar contaminants getting into the waterways it 's so much easier to my question really is there but what should we be doing about the stuff that 's already in our waterways there 's there any measures or mechanisms or budget that you think we should allocate to cleaning up what 's already there bioremediation planting of wetlands and harvesting those those species once again it 's very expensive and it shouldn 't be seen as the primary option sometimes dredging 's interesting the cycle of events in a in a particular environment so Thank You Sophie just um good Leah today we hit a submission to from Environment Canterbury and ask your question around that the community water partnership which currently we haven 't got funding in two and four and Steve Long 's view it was the answer to me was really the at the program education programs that were at best were those where people were actively involved so I just wondered if you 've got any comments for us about education programs like this one I guess which have got a good chance of success and where I 'm coming from and sometimes education programs are criticized because they don 't have any positive outcomes yes a next step we 've seen to make it so we currently so long with the side and virus schools Canterbury have a couple of programs that we we follow the action learning cycle it 's called where you you certainly work with schools to provide them information but then you get in the space to take action and give examples 't pre-ordained what the action will be and that 's similar sort of process I would suggest for these education programs they wouldn 't be just education programs they 'll be education plus action but with the space and knowing what those knowing what the framework is for those actions but not preordained for the people but giving them the chance to take ownership and you 're really advocating that this program is the urban your project which we have been funding from the CCC for from the innovation and sustainability fund yes following that framework yep I think so yeah okay so we 'll move on to the one eyed person extinction just thank you these are my personal views relevant they 're working with us trust although cryochamber I trust _"

    "text": "what everyone like to take this seats please thank you it 's Susan McKenna thank you did Jack Redford want to come up with you he 's welcome good afternoon they 're coming when I talk Chucky 's we are not in the mood pleasure pleasure to be here speaking to you this afternoon I actually speaking in support of my submission that I put into Council I certainly I certainly do not claim to be an expert on global warming and I don 't claim to be an expert in building sea walls but I do claim to be a passionate member of the South Shore community and enjoy the opportunity to be here to support them today first of all we all know about the history I 'm sure that sounds short and how it was formed 450 years ago it was a significant area and place at that time of course an important transport route and over the years it became a pleasure resort even in the eighteen seventies many holiday homes many batches so it has huge significance for Christchurch because of its history of the into a prestigious subdivision in pre-earthquake there were houses along the eastern frontage that were absolutely beautiful and were actually and of a very high value to the public who wanted to buy them now we have 1200 residents so post-earthquake we 've been left with that 500 homes it 's an area which consists of people who are well educated and earning a good income the just a brief synopsis of the area it is a significant cultural importance as a national town this is a treasure and it 's it 's known throughout New Zealand for its rarity as a an amazing habitat for some of them or again migratory birds such as the odd ones at the moment there are so many other birds there and many people of course visit that area in order to be part of that wonderful of marine reserve it is it has also a very very strong residents association Jake and I happen to be co-editors of the South Shore beacon so we are actively involved with the Association and we bimonthly put out a magazine to everyone informing them of on south shore it offers to the people of South Shore a recreational environment and it offers the people of South Shore are a wonderful lifestyle sadly this is how it looks today a quite different lot to how it looked before the earthquake we have been left with the ruins of sea walls that were once built by the residents it appears that the government and the council do not seem to know who 's responsible for fixing these were these walls the community of South Shores been a lot of time going around and tidying up and s the previous speaker spoke about the mother of all clean was happening on Saturday and they put a lot of effort into ensuring that that area maintains its beauty that it maintains a resource to Christchurch and the in New Zealand as a as a rare and wonderful place to be it can be fixed this has been it 's very clear sorry this has just this project has just finished we counsel actually did organize a project to be done whereby they built a rock wall and I raised Street it 's fantastic but it stops it stops just before rocking-horse Road this serves a purpose where it stops what happens out at the shore is that when we get storms when we get us strong easterly coming through and sometimes a high tide and of course that on full moon we get a lot of wave action that comes over a seawall we 'll stop there Edmund I firmly believe it will never flood I don 't think that we will ever be subject to a huge flood if that happens then we 're all going to go under but we do get some wave action happening and it just needs to be tidied up with that particular hard wall in a high bank to continue on around South Shore and around the s3 frontage so I believe the council that you have a social responsibility to the people to the community of South Shore they are strong passionate community they support each other and they want to maintain we must make sure that we make tane these communities their rear and today 's society previously council did the red plus side of the e string that 's on the western side I predict that eight million would finish the wall along the eastern eastery from tuition and it 's a lot less than what was first predicted the cost would be it 's not hard to do the property values at the moment are going down because of the appearance of these walls we must please keep a wonderful resource that we have down there we do get some conflicting evidence about sea level rise we have coastal forum reports that are not always accurate that work against us and as Deidre hunt stated it 's really up to the potential of change for our future it 's what will happen with global warming and of course if we believe President Trump people will happen we don 't_''_480.41 it goes out it 's a resource as I see it should not be lost we need to give a recognition is a wonderful historical place with an amazing history we have a resilient community and they have a strong passion for their area and it 's since Jack realize what an amazing place it yes I just play with you one other point the council 's execution of its responsibilities for South Shore is notable by saying nothing and doing very little at the moment we have difficulty getting building consents we don 't know why we 're getting not getting building consents the council needs to display some fundamental honesty about what its long-term intentions are with South Shore South Shore can be fixed you can build the wall the technology exists to build it all we require is Council to commit to it and I think it 's time we had a open conversation about South Shore and its preservation well look that the open conversation as as part of a process that as being lead by a regenerate Christchurch through the through the what 's a call that what 's the community group that 's been put together around engage how you know and and so and that that is the group that 's been looking at how to engage the community and that very conversation as you know that part of South Shore was a different set of criteria than then we cover but we have had part of the district plan go through and another part of it held back which is the coastal chapter of the district plan so there 's this work to be done we 're not shying away from that and we 'll be done but the conclusion that will come we 'll have to take into account a lot of things including the [Music] he-who-died Aven health history and it 's in its function I mean the keep saying that the coastal side is different from the history side and and you know that that 's true so with there is work to be done but but it is it 's in a process at the moment but we really value your submission and understand how important it was I wish you hadn 't mentioned President Trump especially with that last phrase that you have written your submission just build the wall yeah but but thank you you have been heard thank you _"

all counselors would have known that but yeah for 20 years we 've had scape and I remember going to the launch of I remember going to the launch of blue and Christchurch Town Hall and I don 't know who was there at that time you were not only 10 years old then D or D lon actually would have been teen right look thank you very much I 've joined Deborah and Caroline and I and as Leanne just said 2018 is a very special year for us it 's been 20 years 20 extraordinary exciting and mind-expanding years since Kate public art began to revolutionize open spaces in 80 tawheed Christchurch and arts practice in art erode New Zealand we 've produced 10 legacy permanent art works for the city and over 200 temporary artworks in that time for Christchurch last year we came in visited here and we adorned our counselors work ra Pacifica today we 'd like to present you with this brooch a 20th year limited edition Roche by the same artist of local and cook Island descent Nina Oberg Humphreys as a child the artist Nina overcome Freese first introduction to put international art was through scape relationships developed with her and scape artworks as Polly reference and wayfinders in the city as a contributing artist she was delighted to support us with the design for this brooch and looking at the bridge the to frigate birds that you see pictured are sea birds found across all tropical oceans they migrate each year through the Pacific often reaching New Zealand every year scape brings artists and artworks to fill city streets walls parks and public spaces then they leave and new artworks return with each season the exotic bird of paradise flowers you see draw the eye they originate in lands far away and they travel through the Pacific the flower thick-skinned and elegant represents the many moments of wonder spaces of contemplation and objects that have connected us through 20 years of scape in a city where open I 'll now hand you over to our director Deborah who has also been with scape for all of those 20 years we have been to you a number of times this is our third presentation and we 're really thrilled to be back and to be continuing the conversation about a whole of council partnership to deliver public adversity so in terms of that and we really want to develop and produce great public art for Christchurch with council we want to deepen that relationship we wish to grow our annual scape seasons festival to become a major large multifaceted one with Christ which indeed that ties into and in our city we have had very positive discussions with Christchurch NZ and this year we are transitioning from a community council event to a major event with Christchurch in theater so we have a festival coming up this year it is our 20th and it 's going to be absolutely spectacular so the dates for that is the start of October so we look forward to welcoming you all and hosting you again at that and I know not going to go into that today we wish to build scape up together to a point that we really will be a city drawcard nationally and internationally as a unique Christchurch and New Zealand offering and I truly believe we can do that together secondly we 're here to seek Council 's reinstatement of the public out fund to allow the continuum of highly successful partnership to produce a world-class collection of public art with the council 's public art advisory group this is an excellent proven mechanism for an independent group with specialist expertise to match funding and develop and manage the criteria for the council that will clearly stretch scape in our ability to generate matched funding from the private sector so we wish to continue that we wish also to acknowledge your support and for all the areas that you have been involved and we just want to back up and reinforce the reinstatement of that funds that I talked about before so we really support exactly the same request for funding that I read out before and in the words of our scape advocate when life in Christchurch is more connected more interesting and more enjoyable public art is for everyone we want public art impressed church just like Christchurch wither to become part of everyday conversation how about that a creative City through the arts is essential to supporting artistic growth in the city and nurturing and supporting artists we 're on the cusp of catching up to cities like Melbourne where else can you see within a couple of city blocks and Antony Gormley a Martin Creed artwork and a Gregor Craig work it 's all here and the experience of visiting the city is a public arts destination are starting to get very exciting so let 's do this together and I say it 's about place process in prisons thank you this is where we want to go in terms of our long-term vision for the city in terms of public art let 's do it together thank you well those images there are yeah I don 't know where they are but it 's fascinating I know they call me one down the bottom but I don 't know where and this is a major revenue generator for the Arts it 's like a fairground attraction it 's a mechanical elephant do you buy a ticket to go on it and what what 's the what 's the woman I put on the right there 's an a way way tree up on the left and there is it yorkshire sculpture park which is another brilliant model right and then create revenue through car parking to support their public art they make offering free and he is a Chinese artist and it 's called iron tree so it 's made up of different casts of different tree branches as an amalgamation of them and then in the middle is the Parthenon of books and this is a project from castle Germany from documenter last year and it 's made up of bank books everywhere and realized so many had been right well the questions Yanni I thank you for the time you 've taken in the presentation and for the work that you do um one of the earlier submissions we heard not today but on another day talked about know some of the criticism of things like the Gormley has been the huge cost at possibly the expense of nurturing local talent so I just wondered if you had any thoughts or reflections on you know getting the balance right between the big kind of major public artworks and and putting money into the more local creative areas of the city we run education programs for all Christchurch schoolchildren we 're also inviting emerging artists who need to you get gained experience in public art throughout reactivate program so that 's all about local we 're commissioning kids through reactivate kits so we do have a broad spectrum of balance but I think it 's also very important that we aim to be a world class destination for public art that we have some points of difference that we have a reason for people to visit and we have a very good collection of public art and I think it is well represented we have made a commitment to produce a work by a local woman artist because the public advisory group recognized that the collection of art was for women artists and we 're also working on this major my childhood artwork piece so that is going to be for big outwards so it 's a good mix in here so thank you you I just wondered how much how much coordination say you have with the art gallery and some of the other smaller art galleries everybody we have to because we don 't have a home we roam and partner with different developers to use these sites we partner with the council to produce public art we work very closely for the art gallery through the public art Advisory Group they 're represented on there the members of the gallery staff and we 're having a book launch for solidarity grid on the 23rd of May and I hope you can all come because it 's going to be really spectacular and the artists the German light artists will be here themselves but we pattern with all galleries in Christchurch thanks son look thank you very much and again thank you for what you do and happy birthday and look forward to seeing you on the 23rd thank you _"

    "text": "okay could we have the Christchurch City Council public out advisory group we have Deborah McCormick 's and Paul Lonsdale Paul see I 've been saying if it 's so long you know and a member of it is also an apology and so it 's the executive director of public art who 's a major recipient of the public art fund of council I 'm here to take you through the submission today I 'd like to acknowledge Paul onstyle who is a member of the public art advisory group but also like to acknowledge Lara 's strongman who 's here with us in the audience who is one of the specialists curators in public art in our city and she 's a senior curator at the Christchurch art gallery now you would have all have received a letter from Dame Adrienne Stewart unsure in terms of supporting our submission and she wishes to acknowledge that the Christchurch City Council 's support and commitment to public art has been fantastic however she says I 'm deeply disappointed to see that this funding has not been continued and the draft art advisory group in which we should be celebrating the fact that we have achieved everything in our ten-year plan I 'm just going to give you a quick overview and I 'm very thrilled to see that in a long-term plan that you 're using public artworks to celebrate on both your internal and external communication so that 's just fantastic I just like to take you through and just as a holic to see what pair is and what we 've been up to so we established in 2007 it was actually Damien 's George and myself who made a submission to the LTP supported by joining Harper and to get er done it wasn 't a fun so we advocated through that plan to get 250,000 I 'll take you through some of the things that we 've achieved though our Memphis fear of the public art advisory group is very important to have a specialist separate independent group of counsel to Commission public art I 'm the staff member in attendance at that in terms of our goals I won 't go through them in a we hear stay which is to talk to you about the reinstatement of the public out fund we just want to give you a really good overview of the works that we have done in terms of public assets so we 're playing an advocacy role we 're considering applications for funding step has been the biggest recipient of that funding and we 've produced the public artworks and partnership with the council we 've hosted events to advocate for other matched funding from private developers in from engineers and other people to integrate public out into the building spaces of Christchurch and one of the most recent examples of there is the work just across the road in the kid development which is called poo poo herechickey in terms of the results we have achieved a great deal in over the period eight million dollars of public art over ten years has been produced six million of that has been generated by the private sector in sponsors from match funding in to many in his come from Council so for every three dollars that we achieve council has given really much better than the original intent which was a match found so we 're matching your dollar with three dollars in terms of the artworks we 're really thrilled to see that art is survived this piece will be bagged installed in August and time for the scape 20 year anniversary it was really a beacon when a lot of the landmarks in the central city would be all of these works have been produced by the public art advisory group passing time outside our Institute irena statement of this work which has been moved to the prestige art gallery that 's idea skylines these are all pretty quite clear works and then you see the great story of art surviving all of these artworks that were produced survived the recent works have really been a hero of the we build so tree houses for sport dwellers many many works the Solidarity grid work which is going to be celebrated with an international book launch with the artist Misha cabal where this project was conceived to bring the gift of light from 21 cities around the globe to Christchurch in terms of public art it 's here in our city and this crap please I have a major public work which has also been supported by the public art advisory group as well as fanfare here which is standing proud as entrance in a new way to envisage the city as a creative City Antony for me works all of these works have been produced by the public at advisory group in terms of current projects that we have we 're looking to secure this very popular work in the Botanic Gardens diminution ascend after an approach from the Friends of the Botanic Gardens we 're very close to securing that and we hope to be able to announce that for our 20th we 're looking to bring back a celebrated artwork which has had international acclaim it 's a work of Nathan Portillo who was a local night aho artist we produced it in Christchurch in 2008 and then it went to Auckland for the Walter 's prize into one of the biggest art exhibitions in the world and Castle Germany this project is a project that we Plunkett visiting to a human Mariah in 1905 on flanked by the local comrades where I 'm going to greet them so it 's a historic image but it also talks very powerfully to the cultural relation between NATO unity and the city you can see it for lightbox it 's double sided and we 're currently working with Council staff to have that installed later this year you can see here it is in Germany and pipeline projects we 're working with NATO who on a major entrance at work called nanu to which is to create gateways or water or significant outwards that frame as our central city create places of so raishin but also have been approached off the back of the very successful fanfare by NZTA to develop an artwork for Cranford Street roundabout we 're in the very early stages of this project but we 're looking to celebrate a public artwork to welcome people at the urban edge to the city so I think you can see that we have achieved much and we 've proven that everything installed pre quake has survived in got straight back into the room great public art at the 10th anniversary of the public art fund we have achieved everything in our 10 year strategic plan the city now owns an enviable top-flight public art collection by national and international artists we think we 're on the cusp of catching up to cities like wearing tin an Auckland that have large public art collections and it 's getting to have our funding cut we were on such a great trajectory this funding disappearance threatens the unbelievable more than match funding that we 've been able to achieve from the private sector and after consideration regarding the work required to reinstate a number of artworks person earthquakes plus keeping in mind the reduced level of funding being requested in a difficult financial climate of the council the public art advisory group would like to request that the following is a minimum financial contribution be provided to enable our work over the next three years that 150,000 per annum for three years totaling four hundred and fifty thousand be made available to Commission one or two new public art works 100 we allocated towards reinstatement of a number of key artworks in the city that makes the total contribution of six hundred thousand two hundred thousand each year we have looked at reducing that but for what we currently had previously received that 's a reduction of about fifty to seventy thousand per annum as in the past we would leverage this fun during I 've got some statements here from Dame Adrienne that I just like to read out because I know she 'd feel very passionate about this if she was here christchurch needs to be a confident cultural city with a global view to regeneration that reflects its cultural diversity energy and creativity there is greater community connectedness through the wide diversity of the Arts and the on flowing community educational benefits this brings just do it it 's about place process presents India is immense potential thank you thank you very much do people have any questions just opportunity for developers to be required to give a percentage towards public art when they develop you know something in the inner city or and the city somewhere been thought about and we did submit into the blueprint process around oh but it wasn 't picked up but it 's definitely something that I have a lot of background information on aesthetic models of it would be a wonderful model year it would be brilliant to pilot it in some areas and I think Candy 's a huge potential this time feels right to do it when we submitted when there were so many priorities on the city city is the covers and businesses really wanted to create confidence in the city the timing wasn 't right but I think that there 's a huge opportunity with us in the city now I wonder how we can what we can we can follow they should follow that up as part of our deliberations that thank you very much and I 'm just mindful of the fact that we 've come to the end of our ten minutes and but you can stay where you are do forever _"

    "text": "Isak Theatre Royal we have David stock and Neil Cox welcome you worship the Marion counselors we really appreciate this opportunity to talk to you about this matter we put in a late submission and a very grateful for that being accepted if we look at the Isaac theatre royal it has provided a vibrant hub for the central city there was commenced without the board having sufficient funds to build it we took the punt on it we had 24 million at the time and during the course of construction we mentioned to raze most of the rest of the money we were still a bit short and still are a bit short but the council gave us alone five years ago of two million dollars which helped us through quite a cash crisis and at the time the council advised us that we could come back to you in due course because at the time when the loan was given the financial position of the council was not if I caught it as appropriate as it may be today also the theatre still needs to raise further funds overheating and with patrons being at risk with health and safety we 're looking at fully air-conditioning and which is needed we know that Grasse discreet is to be closed off and we have got an excess from Armour street which we may need to develop we 've got lighting which frankly is antiquated and which people using the theatre stating must be replaced we 've got continual ongoing expenditure which means that we are constantly under pressure for funding we are grateful for the 300,000 we got from the mayoral fund but we also recognize that others in the art sector had received grants and to date we have received the loan but no other grants from the city to assist us in addition to this we have a position where we think we are adding quite a beneficial effect to the economic position of the city in this particular area I 'd also like to talk just briefly about the reason why we need this money from a balancing point of view although we have a relatively strong balance sheet we have never made a profit we 're that our funds are constantly under pressure for one reason or another and although some people have said to us we could borrow to meet this expenditure that is not practical because frankly technically we run where we are cashflow positive but balance sheet and solvent and that 's always been an issue for us we mentioned to get through but it would be of great benefit to the theatre if the two million dollars could become a ground I now like to hand over to Neil to just tell you of the economic benefits and some of the figures about what occurs in that area by reason of having the theatre there I hope you have we have achieved everything we set out to achieve we sort of ran by the seat of my pants to get the theatre open on time on the 14th 14 we got there and since then we 've become what many people have regarded as the shining light of the CBD and we turn our lights on quite often and people walk down the streets tourists the whole area see the lights lighting and it generally is just to put some figures into perspective pre-earthquake we were probably doing somewhere between 160 to 180 performance days a year the past three years we 've topped 300 each year and last year we had 360 individual performances in the theater so business is good and people love the theater and of course we have dependent on the shows and what the shows are but for those of you who attended wicked from showbiz Christchurch over during the months of April I think that many people who went to see that show and maybe have seen it in other centers around the world commented it was well cast world-class production and it certainly was the fact that it is is because we can work with showbiz on a collaborative basis to ensure that we can maximize their results and also provide them a venue that is going to be technically enhanced for years to come so that they can continue to do that but of course as David said it puts pressures on us I 'll give you a small indication as to what needs really I mean the air-conditioning was a value engineered situation prior to finishing the build because we simply couldn 't could not afford it and also the fact that prior to the earthquakes we didn 't have many events during summer and now we have lots of events during summer and that has become a significant understanding of the fact why we need it David touched on the lighting situation we have this man from theatrical terms it 's called dimmers dimmers are everything on your lighting rig that literally is the lighting room some of it was patched up 20 years ago we 're now getting to a point where spare parts aren 't available for that and we need to go to one system and to do that is probably going to cost us around about 300,000 so these are the things that we need to do imminently further down the line the if you go to Asia or China or anywhere any new performing arts venue is being built as an automated flight our system so it 's not the weights going automated we 're talking six the cost to install that is roughly five to six million at the moment and if we we don 't want to be in a situation in ten years time when productions don 't come to us because we don 't have an automated fly system so these are the things we 're trying to future-proof and to make sure that we can continue to deliver the theater for the city and to have the economic benefit to the surrounding area that we have delivered over the last three years to give you some rough ideas gave you the performance days but over the last three and a half years over half a million people have walked through our doors and that 's not just open days or whatever these are ticketed people who 've actually come to visit and come to attend shows and we constantly work with the businesses around new region street in the surrounding area we work with all of them they know our schedules they look at our web sites they open accordingly they ask us what the numbers are we tell them what the restaurants and bars and the surrounding areas boom when we are when we have shows on so we 've we 've delivered on way beyond our promises we had no expectation of the numbers that we would achieve but it constantly amazes us as to the accolades and the endorsement from from the Christchurch community and our patrons as to hell how fantastic the theater is and we agree another important point that we wanted to raise as we we don 't have any volunteers we employ all our staff so the other benefit outside or just that well the venue is achieved is that we we have over 50 paid staff so we create employment opportunities as well they have to be trained in health and safety we have strict Haven Health and Safety processes and recently had a assessment by WorkSafe ins my company will summit and got an A+ rating from our health and safety so so we are delivering on everything that we 've set out to do we work closely with the local organization CSO show-biz as I mentioned we provide community rates for organizations last three years we 've had a sponsorship through ASB which we sort ourselves to be able to fund the theater to provide venue rental for free to organizations from around Christchurch that is coming to exploration date at the end of June and we are in negotiations but they asked me to continue that we 're extremely positive so I think if David touched on as well I mean we we 've covered a lot of these initiatives ourselves and we will continue to cover those initiatives but with the due date for the 2 million loan coming up soon we need to have some form of I suppose allowance that we know that what we 're working to for the future can actually be something we can achieve and I think that it 's obviously to close up there 's been a lot of talk recently and a lot of support recently for the Christchurch new stadium which i think is a fantastic initiative but to give you an indication of how those numbers are made Forsyth Barr in Dunedin for example had 42 field events they call the field so regardless of what happens in the corporate boxes and everything else around for us to have 360 performance days within the theater alone last year must deliver some significant economic benefit to the city we don 't have that in numbers but I think that 's a fair assessment of what the ITR has achieved over the last three and odd years thank you they just leave time for one comment or question from you I think you very much for that it 's been really helpful but I 'm just intrigued and I think you 've done an amazing job of bringing it back and making it available to everybody and it 's the shows have been amazing but I 'm just intrigued had 360 performance days and before the earthquake 160 to 180 at what point does had actually become workable in terms of generating sufficient to repay loans like you seem to be totally full what like we we were on your balance sheet does it become profitable I understand the question thank you it 's I mean at the end of the day we always knew that from day one so it 's and it 's it 's really about how we maximize those results so for example you can have a performance that comes through that doesn 't necessarily perform as well as their budgets would have said it would have done have not d was destructed in a way to help maximize their result and also maximize results for us so we 're very production relied as regards to the success of the productions but on a balance sheet basis I suppose as David said we with sort of on the business line we do make a profit on the overall camp on the overall foundation line it 's the to give you an example our annual insurance now whereas it was I think twenty eight thousand dollars before the earthquake is now closer to 200,000 so and we raise grants and everything for that situation as well can we take that offline I mean I just I mean it 's it 's entirely appropriate that that from a public facing point of view you know you 're able to explain as a council but there are certain elements of any negotiation which is commercial loan actually is that is probably better not to have a negotiation in the public arena at the stage so but certainly what we decide then that obviously will be informed by the advice that we receive from staff and they 'll be working with you on all of these issues and and of course the decision itself will be public so thank you very much for taking the time for coming and speaking to us and congratulations on the work that you do it 's just extraordinary and we all love the show so yep thank you _"

Lanza on the manager of the New Brighton business I mean owners association I 'm here with their board chair and we 're here today to strengthen our relationship with Council we believe that partnership approach to regeneration as essential and there are many steps we 've taken to achieve that regeneration and we 've taken a fresh approach with our submission in the past we 've given and delivered a large wish list and this year we 're actually going to focus on three items that we believe that will they help regeneration next phase so first we support the twelve million dollar capital expenditure that is actually on the long term trafficking budget we further request this budget has a bit of flexibility for the reasons for that is that sometimes to get regeneration to happen until allow private capital to be reinvested into New Brighton some of the public expenditure needs to assist the businesses are still struggling the struggling because New Brighton got badly affected post-earthquake with the depopulation of neighboring suburbs and to exacerbate that the road Brookstone pages road for a year had about equal impact on the businesses and they have not recovered so you know we 're we 're dealing with a lot of stressed people in you Brighton there are very passionate a bunch of people they really want to see this happen and they do believe that they haven 't seen the level of regeneration that has actually happened in other parts of the city but we also support the council taking a leadership approach and detecting some barriers sites which includes the powers of acquisition and from our view we need to see that what we term as the delinquent and absentee landowners who actually are in the way of regeneration and if we can actually tackle those delinquent and absentee landowners and help regeneration we would like to see the council in the government step in and help us achieve a better level of redevelopment of what we 're seeing currently we also ask it is one of our natural assets that the city has and in our view it is part of crisis that is not given that level of respect of space as a as a destination we use it for a lot of our events one of the highest utilised the areas for events but we see it as actually a key spoke and Christchurch is offering as a city so we believe with council viewing it as a metropolitan destination what we 'd like to see is the council delivering a higher level of service to the area with the cleaning of the streets entering of the rubbish bins making the amenity just that raised bar higher than the normal council base level service we want to have visitors that come out to New Brighton for these events for the beach to get a I suppose get a better experience than what they 're currently seeing at the moment with sometimes with the overflowing bins I know the council has worked quite hard on that but we think that there 's an opportunity to look at a caretaker role in those areas that sometimes slip through the cracks and having someone there who has salt focuses to ensure that New Brighton is looking at its best so when the visitors come out there they leave with a really good impression of this wonderful massive the city actually has now obviously I 'd like to leave it open for questions because sometimes if things that you will actually raise that we haven 't thought about all the things we can do together that connection bring about bit of change thank you Tim Yanni thank you two quick questions first of all what is your association 's thoughts about the size of the the business area because there was that size when you hit a school that the area had exclusive rights to Saturday trading that 's really changed so you know you 've got a huge commercial block but you actually don 't have that many people utilizing it so what are your thoughts on reducing that to make it before we agree if you look at the district plan and the review of the discipline the commercial core area has but of course obviously there would need to be some changes to the roading of there to allow them to really take a hold we 're obviously very keen to see more residential and closer into the commercial core we 'd like to see his person for the commercial development so yeah we can fully support them I 'm not I mean I 've done a BNC for over 20 years and it 's you say a mutual you want it to be a metropolitan kind of destination the beach certainly is and you know getting people from the beach to the mall because I 've also been out the recently over the summer to look at the new playground and then you walk 50 meters into the mall and there 's hardly anyone a hundred meters and there 's nobody so what so it be a metropolitan you actually need something to be a destination to get you into you know homebodies got drew smart or whatever it is what are your thoughts on there look at this is for the partial approach comes in obviously we look at the beach to the commercial core isn 't easy you 've got you know marine parade which is quite definitely across and that area there 's any one small little gap I 've got rolling infrastructure with planting out of it doesn 't enable that that 's a heaven and that transfer to happen easily so that 's the first part of it there are some changes we believe and it 's under the the master plan with the automat extension that may allow the transference of traffic off that portion of Marine Parade to travel around through the commercial core and back out the other side some of those things there we think would actually really help and we also know that that would the arm have extension for example sake would certainly create reinvestment we had a property owner who was waiting for the automatic extension to happen he took us 12 million dollars and invested about every hora which is regrettable but so we know that some public expenditure put in the right places certainly will it actually activate catalyzed some of it reinvestment by the private 's a difficult one the the blueprint dictated the amalgamation of lens to happen and we see now that the level of rebuild in the central city through that planning is said she certainly helped get the scale of development which is given the city some critical mess there are some of the key things that the council could do I mean if you just take for example say the aurawave extension that 's a public set that would take out what are term is one of the one of the buildings that XE is having a major effect on that end of the mall there are other sites and New Brighton which again there is legislation under the regeneration act it may be that this needs to be activated and it doesn 't need to be council to there but council could advocate to the government to actually do that because a partnership with the regeneration position working in the central city and also New Brighton the central city dirty 30 approach seems to be working is that as sort of similar approach you 'd favor for some of does not enable some regeneration they have because if you 've got potential and bases looking at the air they see these sites not inspiring for its lobby look thank you very much for presenting today sorry they 'll have to move you off as well some with sony theater but other submitters thank you _"

    "text": "have Judy Greenwood principal of here with school and she has two students with her Francis and Jacob welcome we had some student and the other day from one of the other school with them fully support the installation of lights that the brain scanners here Wood Road intersection our school zone extends from our school which is down here Wood Road towards John Road right through to Gardner 's Road and a number of families in this area have indicated to us that they find the intersection a real barrier for sending their children to our school it 's particularly difficult to turn right from gardeners Road and here would rather end many people avoid that interception lights would also provide a safe crossing point for and pedestrians to cross and increasingly busy here Wood Road and we feel that lights are a safety issue that should be prioritized we 've already expressed support for lowering the speed limit on here Wood Road and I know that dealt with through a different quorum we we there are a number of reasons that we see this intersection is quite dangerous takes to get across the intersection we are wanting students to be walking in cycling and it 's quite dangerous crossing a busy road cyclists and cars have to cross through four lanes and to get across the intersection and it 's difficult to have all lanes clear at all at the same time gardeners Road into here Wood Road both hip and crest traffic flow as does he would Road and with he would Road having two lanes across it cars don 't often speed down there they 've been a number of accidents and close calls that have been personally witnessed by a number of our school families at that intersection and for us the safety of students and families as priority and needs to be prioritized we are particularly concerned because there is a cycle way that goes down near through to the underpass eat under John 's Road interception and so there are cyclists tripling down here but two of our students well actually quite a lot of students I had shared with some of our year five and six students that I 'd like even that purposeful writing they were all busy writing at lunch times but tone of that our students have written about your experiences in concerns and they just like to share that with you so Jacob do you want yep I 'm Jacob in Armenia succeed here at school and I think that you should put traffic lights at the intersection of greens God doesn 't hear what road because the intersections of big hazard to brains he wouldn 't cut fool to school children who want to cross the road it is scary because there are cars coming from so many different lands it is also frustrating to wait so long to cross the road but if we had traffic lights then we would just need to wait for the lights which doesn 't take too long in it and that wouldn 't be as dangerous it was also very dangerous the cars coming from Ghana throat to go straight they hit all turn right because the intersection is so wide that it takes forever to get over to the other side even my parents won 't go that way have made I did cycle safety in my whole group were biking up gardener 's road to the beginners you can only try to turn left but it was very hard and scary to do this because the other cars come in from every direction in conclusion I think that you should put traffic lights in this busy intersection because it takes forever to turn right and go straight but if you put traffic lights there it wouldn 't be so hard could each lane would take turns so remember that so remember there and section is putting wives at risk so please buy traffic lights a dead-end section of brain scanners and he would have roads my name 's boxes and heaps of crashes there including one that went through my grandma 's ramp it 's an almost into a big tree some people say they won 't put lights there until somebody gets killed but won 't nothing too late my little brother and I do the same intersection and we thank you very much it 's really great to hear you come along and make a make that I 've raised with some of the other submitters who raised this issue is that we 've had another submission from another part of war the Pendleton area with the installation of traffic lights has actually had a worse effect it 's made it more popular for traffic to use so in fact the traffic lights have made more cars and more trucks come to their area and the one thing I would just be a little bit worried about as cars coming off the state highway down Gardiner 's road when they know there are traffic lights to take them across here Wood Road and then you get trucks and cars coming down past Breen 's intermediate and unto y rocky road and you just create another bottleneck there and another dangerous intersection so I 'm not saying that intersections not dangerous of course it is but I 'm just I think that people say they 're looking for a safe solution the safe solution may not actually be traffic lights there might be something else but something needs to be done to be the arterial route if got to lots of lights yes and and and that would be better if he would road wasn 't four-lane so he would Road is not designed for what it should be it should be a much calmer Road and you 're raising that point about that on Colombo Street we have two sets of lights specifically for pedestrians one was put in for Thornton school and the other one was put on for some Peters on Fisheries and also for kids to get to catch me a relevant of how many lanes maybe just think about putting the lights and not to make things easier for the terrific but to make things safer for the children and individuals crossing such man don 't worry about the trip at all you know like our hierarchy is actually pedestrians first but we don 't come assume to follow that sometimes so maybe here think with your board at Citroen brings something back to council and specifically look at that because I think it 's about time that we concentrated on the true issue because if we make it harder as Leanne want to use that road more which we saw the other day we obviously have issues right outside a school on here Wood Road and the indication for us was that the likelihood of pedestrian lights being put the it would be very very slow which is actually why I said I said right from the get-go this has to be looked at in terms of the corridor and the location because having been a politician I know the law of unintended consequences and sometimes you ask for something and you get it and then you find that there are unintended consequences but the pedestrianisation that focus on pedestrians and kids on bikes absolutely absolutely I mean I 've got two green children who cross here Wood Road and we take our lives in our hands when we we go together across the yeah yeah yeah I wouldn 't I wouldn 't walk across the mic then roof thank you for decades we 've been building a road basically forecast to move and I think finally we 're seeing a change with a straight jacket been designed for people I funding on the budget for that hillard Road intersection so currently there 's money on budget for the soft way down here Wood Road which would take into account dead intersection but it 's been pushed right out to I think twenty six twenty twenty six twenty twenty seven would you there for support bringing that stock away forward to a much sooner date to actually give it an intersection upgraded to be actually a safe intersection for everyone who emailed me they seen an incident we the pedestrians were it felt in the cars it felt it could have been you know quite a very unsafe situation and she goes through that intersection every day on her way home so yeah I mean it 's it 's around safety that we 're looking at you very focused that you want well it 's not a question it 's just a comment that the intersection at glan Dobby and Idris is not the same as this intersection the intersection at glan dovey an artist was promoted as a corridor for trucks post-earthquake this is completely different so I know what actually the community wasn 't convinced about putting lights in we 've we 've tested this over the last couple of years we 've gone back the community board has looked at it very closely and we think that solution okay and so we don 't need to keep hearing this other stuff pronto well anyway I don 't_''_683.16 I don 't_''_684.4 I don 't not not children that age no I think it 's sensible not to teachers okay principle okay thank you very much for coming in and think thanks kids as well really appreciated _"

    "text": "tramway Historical Society epitome Makara presenting today perhaps I should introduce myself by going ding ding it 's so much cooler better than the previous one we 've just been hearing about but anyway you should find now have a map which it 's labeled high tomb address option nothing it 's coming around as I speak ok the tramway Historical Society once again thanks the mayor and you city councilors for this opportunity to speak concerning the plans currently in place towards completing the city Heritage tramway without the goodwill and financial assistance previously supplied by the council the city would not have the asset we are keen to go on supporting today by now you will have received as our written submission which I hope you 've had at least a chance to glance over I 'm speaking to that of course and there are three tract diagrams which we wish to refer to if you 'd please look at the one that has been coming around labeled high to Madras option the tramway is present operating terminus is just short of Litchfield Street we are very pleased completing the unfinished section of track along High Street together with a similar amount for repairing and upgrading High Street from Litchfield Street to some Asaph we are concerned that once that upgrade has been completed that the tram line should be well prepared for the developers of lower High Street will not want to have the pavers ripped up again once these shops are operating in order to install tram tracts it is surely best to do the road upgrade and at least the trake base instantly at the same time there 's already a precedent for doing that on the tramway it 's one of the common means of construction however there is one drawback to having the same kind of terminus at San as of street as presently exists at Litchfield Street the trailers which until the quakes carried extra tourists behind the trams on the original inner-city circuit cannot be used without a loop such loops were found at the end of most lines in the Christchurch the days of trends for example at Pappa Nui summer Brighton and many other termini so for the same extension and the lead for this has already been explained to you a bit by mr. respose intervals morning if you please look now at the map headed to M loop option as the tramway operator mr. Esposito has suggested the rails already in place along Litchfield and down Poplar Street yep Poplar Lane Poplar Street it 's very difficult to know whose the poplar lanlan should be turned into a stage 1 loop as a temporary measure until the ultimate goal of having the stage 2 loop at Barbados Coventry Williams Street is finally achieved that being our ultimate goal the tremor historical society supports mr. Esposito in this idea of a an earlier loop so you can drag trends address trailers rather we we support that however tracks will still be needed in lower high street as in the height of the high to Madras diagram there this is what wasn 't finished last in my last year 's presentation we need those rails still be put in place not only to support the developers but also lead to the future final stage to development but to pervade be immediately needed to lay the actual rails and lower High Street yet our society firmly recommends that least the concrete track base be laid there preparatory to laying the future rails when the rails come to be laid having the base prepared would cause minimum disruption to the already laid tiles and other roadworks carried out by the council as promised as part of the lower high street upgrade that way there would also be less interference with the shops that well by then have been opened by people like Richard Peebles and so on other developers there and also not having to rip up the the things they 've already put in place just be less expensive for the council so having that track base prepared ready to accept the rails after the business of the of this this loop has been investigated and looked at well let 's now have a closer look at that term leap loop option at present the rails down Poplar Avenue Street Lane have reached to High Street where they must remain for future purposes in the long term that they could go there allowing people to go down and look Aloha Street to visit the shops there anyway that the loop would branch off from Kotler lane rails and swing around sharply to join those which have already been laid in a high street those already there and they lead back to Litchfield Street in doing that loop carrying out that loop there that Luke would swing briefly into the face of the new a sub Street cycle way as your diagram shows to avoid doing that it will need to turn across land on which the parent rubber company building previously stood a small section of that land might need to be purchased by the City Council this we would suggest would be a small price to pay however for the ability to operate trailers once again on the city tram way to do that would increase both the tramways popularity and its revenue will summarize the Society 's position we support the return of our heritage trailers to run on the Central City but in so doing we do not wish to jeopardize the ultimate completion of rails to to the Barbados Street loop that being the ultimate goal to reach once repairs have been effected to the Catholic Basilica and we know that that Basilica will become a draw card in the city in itself for visitors and others to the city finally another tact briefly the society wishes to enter a strong plea that future additions to the central city 's tram fleet be composed of Christchurch 's own heritage trends several of which await restoration at very mean instead of Morsy imports councils financial support towards carrying out such restorations of our heritage fleet would be greatly appreciated as it has been of course for so much else that the council has done we remain firm believers and maintaining our valuable contribution to conserving an aspect of Christ teachers past which is appreciated by locals and visitors alike while Christchurch 's rebuild continues unabated thank you thank you very much we were listening to mr. Esposito just prior to lunch and he seemed to clarify for us that the focus is on the on the loop and not not stage two so that 's something that I think what I hadn 't appreciated and that submission and you have clarified is that for the for that loop to be put in place we actually need to buy some property because we can 't go down the wrong way on term Street now that it 's been changed direction yeah so so that it that brings it to a natural terminus there I 'm just what 's the natural loop yeah it is electoral note loop but I 'm actually going to say it 's a natural terminus as well yes and in line with how far that Dena 's from the High Street development so I mean literally it was it 's across the road yes and from there down to to the end of lower High Street okay from there down to the end of lower High Street is Richard people 's development and the the buildings down there yes but I mean literally crossing the road and walking and through the back way and directly into the development so I mean that that there is a possibility but I mean if the counts are it 's the loop that 's the priority isn 't it mm-hmm we 're prepared to back that but we don 't want to see the the future development down to the bottom of High Street scattered by putting in hello we want that kid to be options to be kept open yeah I mean yeah it 's it 's such a big ask for that amount of disruption for that long all the way for the completion of stage two and and when you 're actually looking at the terminus for Stage two it may be it may be a terminus too far we will we will consider this we live in hope thank you but thank you very much for making the time to come on and and make your submission _"

    "text": "can 't breathe Steve flounce and Catherine trap good afternoon thank you for this opportunity to present our submission to you before I start may I convey some news counsel a farm had a little boy yesterday oh great we valued a strong relationship with the City Council and we look forward to working alongside the council in all areas where our responsibilities overlap Environment Canterbury and the City Council work in partnership in the implementation of the Canterbury water management strategy your leadership and engagement across these programs is very much appreciated we 're very supportive of the measures proposed within the draft LTP that will lead to improvements in the city 's water quality waterway health biodiversity and flood mitigation we note in particular efforts to improve outcomes in waterways prioritized by the Christchurch West melton zone committee and look forward to seeing the improvement that will come from this word and may I add there that we 're glad to be partnering you in the submission to the local government New Zealand on copper brake pads and I sent a message to the an the other day Friday the whole of the sector chose to support our remit so that is puts us in a very strong position with local government New Zealand we understand the funding pressures faced by the city we do however strongly recommend that funding is allocated to those program that will help drive behavior change that will need to be improved environmental outcomes over the long term the role and value of enviros schools program cannot be overemphasized and we ask that the council make an ongoing commitment to this program without childhood without long-term commitment the program in the city will have to be withdrawn from schools and early childhood centers from July 2018 we also strongly support the proposed Community Water partnership although we note that no funding is allocated to this in the councils draft long-term plan the program developed by the partnership will help create a framework to work with the community together to improve water waste through behavior change education and awareness initiatives Environment Canterbury is focused on providing sustainable public transport service we support the continuation of an accessible city project and the level of an that these are accelerated and completed where possible this will help ensure that we can develop a transport system that delivers to the expectations of our community the public transport Joint Committee I think is is an invaluable forum where we work together as is the Water Forum both of those joint committees I think are extremely valuable in aligning our interests where they overlap I take the the submission itself as having been scanned and those are the few points that I would like to highlight thank you very much David some it 's good to see the key we Steve Dayna bull public transport how are we getting on with the things there electric buzzers I know only what do you know that red bus is looking to install I don 't really wide I mean citywide through changing the rules so that it 's not a constant race to the bottom we still haven 't landed on that it 's a desire I think which we all share I think me more than many around the table because I 'm particularly aware of the issues confronting us support what could we both do to make that a reality I continue to to have our staff working together to a common goal to make that a reality Dion I just wanted to touch on the sustainable transport thing as well sustainable transport obviously what Vickie was saying is about you know your you know the goal of going emissions but from what I hear is sustainable transport options and an Ekans view is potentially about money rather than actually a service to the community so I mean am I in my correct in thinking that it 's the sustainable about you know it 's got to make its own vs. have actually been a service to the community all of the above we were caught in a very difficult situation where we were spending reserves to subsidize bus routes and when we put out that proposal in our long term plan that we would cut six of the routes we knew exactly what we were doing and the response from the public as has been huge and we are doing everything we can to maintain those services to that we had something like 700 submissions on that subject alone is manifest so yes we are committed to an accessible public transport system but it has to be sustainable economically as well as environmentally I think the emissions issue is going to be the lever ultimately that brings us to mode shift I can 't see any other lever that is going to help us move from single occupancy car journeys to buses and active transport so yeah I think emissions is the big Tim Arin throw Sarah if we get thank you public transfer buses etc there are service industry like a shop or whatever when you into the bus that is a service you know you view customer service etc and it 's interesting you say you 've got 700 people can 't_''_447.32 be contacting with regards to pulling those services when you were looking at those because for you they have to be financially sustainable what do you think that the disconnect is because obviously people want to use buses you 've concentrated here and getting the accessible city up and running but unless people are coming to town with no one in it so as you can 't got an idea of where the Gipper 's what 's missing cuz we 've heard from the future and we 've really gotta listen to it so I 'm just wondering if you do you know the get beyond it well we 're not in an easy situation with regard to public transport in Christchurch and it 's very different from from Wellington and Auckland were a flat city we 've got this huge cobweb of of roots which endeavour to bring in as many passengers and catchments as possible we 're in an environment where motorcars are cheap petrol is still relatively cheap although it 's going up it 's now 75 a barrel coming off of a floor of something like 45 there are many many unknown factors which are which contribute to the take-up of public transport but we both our councils working very hard to make it sustainable and accessible service yeah I 'm so two questions thief so I 'll go real quickly first one is would you be interested in trialing a team to see how it would go see if we get a mess of uptake because we seem to get a congestion at peak times there have been several suggestions of things we could do to break the mold if you like one of them is have a flat fare of 2 making schoolchildren free all sorts of things we 're just at the point of introducing Wi-Fi onto two routes so there 's there are little things happening all the time and I hope cumulatively they have some and then the other one I 'm getting a sense of frustration that the focus is entirely on on transport which indicates another another problem that we should sit down and just talk about offline perhaps I mean we 've made a submission on a Keynes LTP around the bus thing so if I just take Phil and Sarah so I think you Steve my questions about water like and you refer to the proposed community water partnership and part of that as you say is around achieving behaviour change through education in awareness of a question really is around had I guess training and teaching around water issues for a long time do we have an idea as to what programs work best yep to make sure that in fact that this partnership works well well I think it 's the engagement of young people envira schools is very important in that but anything which empowers young people and volunteer groups to actually do the work on the ground rather than focusing solely on plans and policies changes to the plans to actually get some money going directly down to the ground which empowers groups which are lining up to do work thanks team Sarah thank you just a question on the water quality stuff that you 've mentioned here you 've said that you 're supportive of measures that lead to improvements in the city 's water quality and we look at the rivers and things like that and did you have a view on the fact that we 're not budgeting enough currently to improve our wastewater and that we 're likely to see increased wastewater overflows into our rivers during the period of the long term of funding but I do about the importance of wastewater going into the rivers and as I mentioned the the remit about copper brake pads is really picking the easy first easy thing that can be changed stormwater but I 'm talking about you know a surge and things like you know impacting on look thank you very much and appreciate you making the time to come and submit on the long-term plane thank you _"
