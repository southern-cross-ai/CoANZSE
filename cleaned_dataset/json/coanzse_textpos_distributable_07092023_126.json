    "text": "right councils September 15 its report to CEO mr. Muir I won 't take too long and um we 'll pass on to the team 's take you through page by page but just in terms of the highlights they 're obviously a high vital councillor Stewart back around the table and there was a there was a a violation which is obviously always a a process that we have to run which takes some time on it but on the good news front of ear that we won a what a good award of this community event on the Year award for the food power whitening estoppel which is a great achievement for the team along with the partners and that that event and then talking about events I 'm just about there that we obviously checking in to our event season now we 've already started off with that work a few major events including the with Curtin eat one month which will see pumped about 1.3 million bucks into our very economy and he never the summer period I 'm sad what follow or something get us will be Saturday and then right throughout the summer we 're we 're back to back every weekend I think something big in town so we 're starting our busy period on the negative side with hit quite a bit evangelism lately but if they around road signs which is a bit disappointing and end a few waste water spills unfortunately which are still largely due to these people things that I should be otherwise flushing so it 's disappointing unfortunately an invoice comes in good afternoon the good news is you 're up to page 152 already added to that as far as the monthly treasury management report is concerned you can see that our investment income is well ahead of plan both on the general fund where we 've had a return of three point three five percent this budget 22.98 and the Tal fund where we 've got a return of five point seven six percent this three point seven five budget so with the OCR still at 1.75 it continues to be a challenge and that major effects coming through and that our level of bank as exposure in that area but when there 's no corporate paper around to invest into we don 't have a lot of choice but the the position in total is quite positive for this particular time of the year so we move on to the financial performance of counsel at the end of September as I said last month we were a million ahead and if we continue that way till the end year I think we will come out looking pretty good at the end of September we 're still 1 million ahead of plan there 's not poor planning as just higher levels of revenue in the areas of fees and charges and investment income the investment income I 've already talked to the debt book we have net borrowings at the moment of 28 million because of the high level of cash and the only major change from last month is that as far as the capital budget is concerned with included the bow wave from the previous year which was eight point six million which shows the full-year budget now at 32 point 1 million to achieve that particular budget for the year but before I pass on to the rest of my colleagues has any questions on those the other one month you 're gonna get sorry well one month you gonna get some difficult questions well we keep giving positive messages basically the questions I 'll be too difficult mr. Fox you worship Thank You Community Services you worship that cover some of Alan 's area as well as mine but as you can see on page 160 whine all the community services three measures are currently on track and also in terms of 160 one thing I will talk about is the election result in respect of the review of emergency management defeats that clearly might have an impact in terms of that technical review of the of the sector we haven 't seen those results yet another council epochal also support we haven 't seen any results of that particular review thank you well I just don 't know you worship I think come down through is actually being presented fully yet yes our new minister Minister Faruk so will no as usual for areas in terms of community area in civil offense team working closely together and some upcoming neighborhood support events and I think Tina from memory there 's an evacuation one of the neighborhoods coming up and it 's blamed his part of an exercise so really just business as usual on those two spaces just with regards dog registration so I know hopefully they paint agency awesome here the plans to help adults and tell but I wish I could answer your question on dog registrations you just Liberec at unfortunate [Music] we just felt like oh I 'm not you I get ninety nine point six dollars just to coming to make in that area I think the whole online system that we 've moved to the dog registration notification or something I think it 's probably helpful okay talks community service given afternoon all so just the water particular so before we get into the each of the activities just a general comment this is to the end of September so July or worsen September 's a time where we do a lot of design that the campus lines are pretty low at the moment but we get into construction periods now the biggest one on the water is obviously white onui we 're here to start up meeting last week and they 'll be starting on the 13th of November construction and that 's a big part of the Quebec spend in the water area in particular my projects proposed so they 'll be coming back to Council in December process and the other red mark there is much rocky that 's our basement so you know mr. chair there won 't be too much interruptions through the holiday period with what in a nerve with that boy I just just wondering pipes first weeks yeah holiday period yes oh well that we done a message them working through that whole life period we 'll sit down with them and go through when they 're actually going to to be doing the work but obviously they said that is a consideration because it is a busy time yeah yeah okay so the only other read on water is motor upper reservoir that 's just been done and they 've been made as need to be installed there is transportation and again I 'll just reiterate that the bulk of renewals usually commenced from next month through to March these heels of rehab so that 's why there 's very little blue there on their capital expenditures to date and happy to take the other questions on transporters majority '_''_606.27 the wrist as is or I think isn 't that brief sales either retail you know three chairs Wow and so there 's a sale extension I think is still extension it is Authority what do you want to interrupts 400,000 machine this just very very poignant thing funny bucket around third point I 'm gonna ask mr.

    "text": "yes my princess from camping Dynel adoption the channel that 's crackling John how are you worshipping Council nice okay I won 't take this reporters read and I 'm happy to take any questions okay any questions are trained so this is an icon viral so where the risks connecting this bio today or one of them we now what the program of the cons that 's why revolutions against those face-to-face for making that we only know a little bit in it that you 'll be really there atoms and merciful terms of the Bible the legislation and God friend connect and requires counsel to heave surveillance before ahead and keen may go on to restrict bring camping and you 've also a food from submitters come through the chamber through this process of indicated their concern with freedom camping and parts of the district and so the Apostle that you 've become to all the proposed by or you 've come to the scene as a as a elegant way of meeting both of those demands be restored some questions on both and both motions in terms not you 're meeting the strict interpretation of the evidence that 's required in terms of the XO so it 's a balance for you now you have several options here today you could either make the bylaw or you could not make the Bible and I guess complicating effect the state that you do here the government where we 're releasing a discussion document on friend camping at some point and it 's been delayed as I understand up due to the premier legislation so we don 't know what is provide for use so that there 's a further complicating factor into the into the max and that 's probably about as far longer the key against Elizabeth or probably ground can maintenance various discussions around without like Aaron particularly protecting like the forward by the wave front and pixie that the handle meta prohibition to me that was a mr. moral it in the back of it conversation these obviously interested as well as a member lindsaym see I you know as a as a freedom camp another country with regard for example read at 300 very 're going to be riveting vehicles parking outside houses it gets a bit more involved you know with with regard to actually affect the excess for environmental health or safety which is and the reason of the freedom can be a given but you can have some sub legislate against you have a policy you know beside those areas I just a bit concerned with it we should be really looking at that kinda me the religious fifty but it 's relevant with its own my my hopeful for taking the life lecture on keeping vehicles cream cans away from the right front that whether the fifty or hundred meters with a sexy workable okay the air efficiently counselor back it 's also a teacher agreement counselor Lipson and regards to this I sort of that before that title Dennis a presentation you know about people who put their seven a half thousand dollar ebike from the back of the campers in and come and stay two or three days and it was sort of thing be not the people that distress by law is intended for its the slightly their seats along the length run to the people that desiccation need to rubbish everywhere and just and with the sort of legality challenges and the risks that if they identified I 'm not comfortable with this value but my hash fix this is great and for our community this is what they wanted we need to do but my heat tells me from the government 's perspective that I think we need to hold off on this so that I understand these reserved metal claims around passwords of the Social Work we 're camping is prohibited bad light in the C 's case I 'd quite like to see it it sort of Okinawa apologized to staff that is probably an area that we should have asked about Europe will lead to heavy deliberations back in Maine and it will say yes a hundred liters excessive not too sure yeah our be patient solicit play so you preferred to fear on them until another direction from the central government angered us on a system that we talked about the reserve management claims around the lake we 're no camping this and just especially arriving it just fear that Messiah yeah okay can she come you think you worship um yeah I 'm yep I guess we 're all quite all on this issue around and just for self accident and I was have ceded that you know balancing the community expectation with was looks of the Act which is a very permissive it but I suppose if I put my limbs over the switches from a turbine Ward district councillor perspective I know what the main date is from from my community in it to enforce exactly what we 've talked about in he around that the hundred read meter buffer because it does impact no matter what on on the very people that live in this district in want to interact with the atoll which is the lake so I think putting that into the pot along with everything that we have to consider IIM in favor of moving forward sighs our communities and that 's unless we actually intercept build it in re what we understand failure to enact it I guess it 's the parameters we debuts and so I 'm more in favor of supporting it is okay okay um yeah so I 'm probably tomorrow here and from the other end of the lake we are we kind of see no reason recognize the economic screen so that visitors room when they come to our area so in also rules for particular environment and environment that they don 't want to enjoy in this lab so I 'm quite keen to just put this up into a little bit more unlikely this planet it shows earrings or without the bowl internships or what did you get more than hold okay the other comments I notice absolute and also going to do I don 't want to say I don 't want to wait for the government paper I think that 's the wrong thing to do for our people and I feel really frustrated that we can 't ask to by law and we have Russian here but I think that to get the extra information about the impact of reserves as important before I buy make that decision but I 've certainly don what those campervans lined down yet and our people rightfully I 'm not going to be happy about that we don 't know who the government 's going to be over to me so he wrought and runs a lot of a table any points on supporters counselor Kenya honest one I think our community has signaled to us very clear what they want us to do and I think we need to stand up for our community I understand that we have some legal issues and we are constrained by the freedom camping act we here to represent our community and for that reason I think we need to act now as counselor in consider I don 't want to wait for central government I left because we could be it could be two summers I 'm not sure waiting for a plan about reserves is actually going to give us any more information that would be materially significant at the state so I think we should put a stake in the ground and make the squat a lawn now through the gin I know drunk teens of support with the Millers and protection of the lake because I 've what you know no more no no no be more consciously royalty and the headaches have back in a row that 's not a bed of a big stick Brian body else young threatening education I think we need to be little bit more little consideration with regard to we 'll go with a spoiler otherwise he 's going to find a sauce for the gate against anyway and I think I think would run with regard to 100 meters yeah exhibit there 's got a lot of eels well that 's going to be predictable workable to understand unfortunately it would probably be a lot more the staff of thinking no it 's got a lot more logistics REM management or a try to pour set the signs are probably offered solid sir but one making bit more common sense we 're going around away okay because I have I have next few farm quite came to murder on to and I think we do need to make a decision and get on with it if there are we pass it that way I mean just remember them I don 't think the concerns have been raised with us why the third party would be I don 't think I 'd be satisfied for those 50 meters or a dramatist again time travel episode Nigel or Jane D so we entered this Bible today yeah squad 11 France on tomorrow is that is that fine collectible can 't pump determine whether a party on judicial review however it is liking that infringement could be in doubt if we are judicially reviewed and that got our powered yeah okay so I 'm going to pass a boil or and the particular party might so Jesus will remove it puts the whole pile into jelly correct right effort assess their counselors and the thinking about us and if there 's a general at this and thought around the table that the decent theater information gathered and rather than just waiting for the central government lead in the advice from officers is that it would still be an opportunity to do some extra work on this some more consultation and to at the December council meeting okay thank you for my camera will make a decision and we 'll defer this are and 4x transmissions method we live management to your resume its narrows and so things up who would want to to clear this and bring it back to a special purpose or EFS modules indicated lead with me external got some time and cityscape and so just us nodded clear forward so we still have time to go not out to the community for consultation and get perhaps the new value like if we took a bit of a bonus face you look at the plan and and then we perhaps the docs this present by a little to accommodate those things would we still have time to go through the consultation so that the process their priests and the process would be and to lead us on the table while I 'm soft in theater work there 's one Lance together and we consult the community and file all back to the next available council meeting which is likely to be in December so it would include a would to support castle from not having a judicial review it was certainly address and any reservations in the community about whether the council is needs to Rican so or not so would address this issue because everything must be care if I can it it does wouldn 't necessarily address the issue that you 're greater in western terms I don 't know our yeah I think my softening bleiben then I think what we 're trying to indicate usually once a cancel money well surely hi Russell d50 great well not exactly now we 'll sit now that 's I am yeah I think if we can cannot but further compromise today that we strong want to get to some and have something and then the scenario yeah but yeah yep Casa gone yeah I was just going to is for something to be clarified I suppose you know just reflecting on my earlier comment you know we have to be measured I guess in our response so so absolutely be interested in seeing what that look like but if it 's you know if it 's other a buffer the non-locking okay because I think that 's the very big also I will ever understand I don 't know how to get to their point you know I mean is that what we 're talking about of what we talking about so that she might be reduce you know take up a good portion of the solution you I can say is and then you say it 's my advice would be that you 've got and you know she 'd I noticed a problem among our father our photo for town which is a lot clearer I don 't have a good handle on up there to advise you around the wrists the lake with the water out the buffer we came you came path can depend on anything it may be there when we if we were to do some work and then make out the land holdings in the team Jane that ability that came or not all those other pieces it might be that the problem does initial necessitated by the war in most places anyway which might resolve the problem so I initially to be able to do their work bring it back to you and then we can make an informed decision or you can make an informed decision based on their information it might be at that point that you decide the spiral stairs are still needed under the current product and their case you haven 't lost anything other than four weeks and you can add three and a half absolute and you can then competitive a prompt alternatively you may look at if they are come out there and say but they 're the actual effectiveness of the gonna be so limited income and the risks around the spoil or I want to mean one on this particular way and do the consultation if the authorities required to be able to make bed so much so I can have a you have all the information at that point can I ask can we be sure that the rule had the information really quickly on the mind to move on so it Clint are you entertaining that we bring back their net deemed by that and why before liable 't like the idea of making decisions based on other parties in France as opposed to where our community wants yep so the same this would be more about about you making the decision based on on solid information so that you know that the scale of of the other spirals can I have a seat or not rather than anybody else having an input through this probably more more suspected as well regarding put a common sense and Ron to be worthless relevant you know you know they made one certain may not be one for the whole area 50 100 meter on forward above it particularly has a tsuba falling victim you may receive it a little more homeless on it okay all right three weeks if it is a little two to three weeks so just a mouth just leave it on the table just leave it on the table okay I want to commemorate

Council so there 's underway and invite wise this and work that we 're doing down in Riverside Park until we took the gum trees out there we are to be recently in doing some planting and Inc

have been under some pressure and we 're working with the Regional Council on most its feet assassins delight levels dropped as we come into winter the amount of erosion on sea has dropped coinciding

wonderful those that would have been more visible and in was one of those unfortunate plans away from countries down because they 're overcome in health and safety risks in themselves because partly because of the undercutting and I think it was the fridge committee and made a resolution and that vacation to do men 's retreat so not to undertake which should review them it will be up to you of

add like original council vram operations aren 't even a good look at that area and yeah they are both in agreement there to manage retreat which is the best approach for now but obviously if you want to revisit then we can we can run that to free yeah because I parallel that also quite some spatial and expand the homes through the voltage from station and revaluation include and that was going probably five six years ago I 'm just wondering whether or not that is some of the reasons why it 's now just watch need fast asleep comment okay so I guess it will be a number of funds via which

secondly is the welcome to the council to tell Anita you have no power over Harlan the to Tom all day ultimately very much a moment and of course the councils who have been very very skilled in there in the understanding that in you memorize disabled is discussed in business in a Yamaha surround so today 's Halloween a couple teenager put people Minako what what are not particularly here no later

now with two [Music] ronita was one of the chief we not this was [Music] [Music] something like that but the genealogy is basically decided basically the same way to topple placed between the same at all the events that came not when was team so Tia was another ancestor so they 're all the oldest disorder like many cooking ttn and not too late [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] they 've all didn 't he like me [Music] [Music] Dominika spoke to me in relation to apart from the historical factors pertaining to our region we have just recently signed the settlement and of course what 's important for all of us for each couple is making sure the planning going forward is what are we going because some good people out there like Tom all over there and and we have dominating me and various other people who are looking at a strategic way and and therefore some of the auspices of the court act done now that 's new for me and new for our people when we start using title sorta contained under the unity of of habu and and it 's new because this has never been our ways and means of dealing with issues from helping to help each other and putting it all into one basket could be quite taxing and so the court a teller who are made up of representatives from each mother which consists of 26 people and the alternates and they are primarily made to to see how the plan is going to how it 's going to appear so that they can deliver all that back to the people one of the things that is very obvious we 're not we 're not in a position where we have people who are able to work actively to put something tangible with tangible outcomes and that 's also help people from the hopple is understanding the dynamics if we want to deal with with economic development then we need to be very very sure that we have the right horses for the courses it 's very important and of course we have that in our lien then we have social development and we 've just gone through an election is going to be the government again the court ain 't done it has to seek what is going to be achievable and even though the various organizations within within our region that are able to deal with with those with those issues and a team I I see the council is playing a timid role in relation to some of the issues that face us as great players and so again it 's been able to interact and been able to to bring issues to the council because historically we haven 't been a people to do that we try to deal with our issues internally but because of the dynamics and the changes we have to go out and then seek see certain organizations whether that so on or central government and so it 's very it 's a very important time for our region for a local here not too funny talk and then with the uniqueness of having a paramount chief now again that comes under pressure because of the demands of the Habu and it comes under pressure because now these are not only on our people on our huddle but also on our chief and so with all of those things happening by the end of next year maybe or the year after we should have something in place and even though we interact with you the council on different issues and I can keep you various examples however you know what they are the other thing is I would like to acknowledge the council for making an attempt I see that there has been classes to do classes and I 'm I 'm breathing I 'm glad that that the council has acknowledged the culturalism and I 'm not saying you should spend a long time deliver dental you got other issues to deal with but being able to understand just and I must also say it 's not that ever the language of our people it 's the understanding of how we want to go forward and so there 's no misunderstanding and and I think those processes have already started Gareth you have recently taken on a senior just mr. Dewan target which is one that 's good and of course you have your strategic relationships manager Dominic very good again the pressures will be on dominant and on Dylan because of what l tried going forward has to do and so the relationships are very important they are paramount when I think back to the early 50s anyway my elder my cousin will say well I hope he he agrees with this my grandfather was the founding member of the total County and his name was dictum in a minute did our couple known as mr. Tate late and one of the things that he spoke about growing up was about being able to interact because our elders our women you know I mean we 're very much focused on making sure that they look fuller their grandchildren generation a lot of us went away to boarding school and so they put a lot of emphasis on that and then put a lot of emphasis on saying that it is very important to absorb what the partner has to offer heads or bit other than what he going to school to speak to him that 's my dog you go to school to live about what makes the world go round and of course since then young ones have been indicated and although the good ones they 're already working and it 's going to be very difficult to try to get the myth and they and I 'm very happy to say they are in many different fields or proficient in the legal medical be accounting and so etc etc so we help you with them but all their knowledge has to come back it 's payback time and I say that literally they have to come back to help their people so that we can sit and relax and just tell story and so with it I thought it was very important to share it and ask questions and you know sometimes sometimes you one of the things about asking questions and it doesn 't matter what they are as long as there 's a question thank you what are your thoughts or do you have a view on obviously the outcome of the weekend and the change in the Maori seats and I will be frank I will be frank what we had previously and national who embraced the Maori Party there 's a disappointment and this is earning me there 's a disappointment on my path that they didn 't get back into Parliament when I when I look across the spectrum of central government national and I don 't want sake this also I 've always been national and it was very important who which party when you look at the history was prepared to put the hand up to that one and there was national and I say that without doubt and so we lost two representatives of the Maori Party I 've got to say this right now is that since they 're asking there 's been various discussion while some that we need to participate do you participate to resurrect the Maori Party back into Parliament and because to us they play a pivot row and they weren 't just seat warmers I feel the next three years if we have a change ago and again that 's only my opinion how does that affect us as a as as a as married and within our looking we historically has a voice supported mega boys supported labor mum and dad supported labor like many other months and dance but they said man called Winston Rosie exactly yeah Winston he sees a lot of things but I will in the in his turn in his favor Winston says a lot of things I see Winston down in Rodman every twenty-fifth and we have some conversation em I hate to be a politician you know and when I hear things like all he wants to get rid of the treaty and he wants to get rid of Amyris eats good he 's just babbling on that all he 's doing babbling on and so it 's going to be very pressurizing for being there what they call it the king maker that titles to hi Winston he knows that the decision he makes has to be the right one otherwise he 's going to be gone and so no matter what the issues were in relation to the multi-party they took the stance they did the work and that 's all they did and whatever whatever we thought of man some of us didn 't agree some of us did agree and so there 's the change that changes are already happening within barring them looking at it strategically not just off the hits it 's done strategically here 's a Christian all helpless t how does the council 's feel about going forward into and recognizing some of the changes that are taking place even in our region how does the council feel its plan its strategic plan going forward and if it 's covered everything to get some very good [Music] so what do that we can probably long story short bringing person 15 year reviews on to the other two plans elements and so Stephen he is so to a vision which is not public ish and do some byline attached to that and there 's going to be strategies we 're doing an economic development plan because we 're very serious about what we want to achieve in this region but to have a vision that inspires you we believe is really important so we have done it and we 've still got more work to do I mean just to add to that we 're a part of the Train iam we 're about to go into our long-term plan process where we look at what we need to do in the next 10 years as far as infrastructure what we want to build on from that vision what we want to achieve in the next 10 years so we can sort of make out the budgets and plans going forward and have a work program along with it yeah and over the last you use me we can really have in our consultation so as far as the councilman 's getting to meet grassroots community and a monkey 99 as well as online because we really as far as the communication so we can really have all those areas to ensure that we are and one thing me and David has done is he 's actually allocated us portfolio areas to look after and which will give us a more serve aimed approach at what parts of the community we we deal with so there 's not a lot of double handling for areas of the district that are going to miss out having there to my conversation with Council I think the opportunity to have the council on a partnership arrangement look to predict or it 's the future because it has to be the visionary sort of state because I think it complements but the cinnamon of course different the closer we can begin bring council into finito together I think the outcome is very exciting to bring all of it thank you I think it 's crucial and again it gets to they better understanding you know on both side not just not just outside will cite to we mean to understate and even you know just coming back to the fact that with various people whether that be dark or or whoever is that we still need to get our heads around the fine print the legislation so on and so on before we start to to assume and we shouldn 't assume because all these things have been put there for a reason so all right heavy publishes but you 've got this these other dimensions which is legislation and being able to put that into a bit understanding and so that we can all go for the tree one year today that we really appreciate you hosting us for the meeting today and I 've really enjoyed getting to know more about from where I and the background and I would say on behalf of David I know that he and all of us haven 't really had I think over the last few years since I 've been involved in council to make sure that the relationships are very during good and strong and that involves consultation we 've got coming up now within a way to New Plymouth on Thursday so there 's so much going on that and that 's our aim to continue to do that so thank you very much for having us here today _"

Christopher here oversee and we sold this part of their business to gin tree prick so does this sort of born this going forward in the future or don 't come inside I think so so every day is 10 years

what limits encompasses around your taste as a reservist consent monitoring and 4y squared discharges strong little discharges with their standard so there 's the laboratories base down at the

of council and for a further 12 minutes any questions Thank You mr. C any questions our society 's today just a really quick question for me I 've made a saint this is an annual renewal and I 've never seen it come before council before by is it because it 's come

apparently science against carries thanks Tracy thank you very much 5.4 when cancer story performance report with acting CEO if the minister would so I went together but come on sure is what you do so I guess the highlight something that you 've seen this place is fairly empty now with our to miss an amazing job moving it 's quite a military maneuver millipede over here in a long time I think the on Monday is worship open the customer service center and that 's a real message of how we 're going nothing the team down there really lovin that Noland [Music] we 've commenced the efforts of the 290 service center and we post some stuff I delay their Korean arrival and that we 're knocking down words and doing things got ready for our new tenants that 's a long time on schedule we were down quite a bit with carrot as you like how does an amazing job out in the community helmets are things a bit of a team behind are now actually cleaning up other people 's rubbish but on there 's been some I guess one of the challenges been how we get the community to serve understand that message so we 've come up with an anti litter campaign which is in trying to involve kids we begin to understand that actually things are the cars or on the pavement is not a guardian I just got to come from the home so really that 's the tactic around that and we 've got some great economic figures that you 'll get in the CW in this week like the last quarters an economic figures our GDP growth this quarter and that 's being reflected and if you say our our built-in stats as well it 's awfully important CW CW in this way and it 's interesting world in base or bad news in terms of the nomination it 's hard to though we 've had some substantial interests in the company vacant Council position down at Iranian with three of three nominees and some quite a large interest in the community board which is actually really cool because only that can be a little bit of a stroll and the vital signs of project was really about where the community sees the investment back into the communities so if you can 't jump jump on their vital signs project website gives you a bit more of a faithful to all those about this area and so missus any questions I 'll throw the talents talked about they 're just one Christian to do with the economic assessment that 's being done down in Toronto not so the races a draft report which was given to the working group we we just said that it 'll come out for general distribution I 'm picking will be sometime in there 's a couple of weeks yep plus any other questions of mr. just before we 're going to miss him in hand mr. he ever to tell me what meals quite right inside of the burdens that we 're moving into now we kept get that streets my reports on all of those so we know that around bigger than what went even prompt there was my question I asked what the ratings would that question is I don 't know I can find the for you thinking when you derive then information okay what okay at this stage we you do not have any financials as far as the performance report and Janette and the team are still working with the auditors nine major issues have arisen but there 's quite a long process to end up with the order fit accounts you can imagine origin it 's as far as the plane treasury management reports concerned the start of another investment unit fortunately the first month of the year we 're a hit and also on our actual investment return on the general funds of 54 million and on the te o fund of 56 we are at just over five percent for the first month so hopefully we can continue with that level of performance for the year but as I say this is just the start of June [Music] okay so okay so Anderson gets a nice information can tell me cancel performance report drive new place maybe I can secure a second about cancer [Music] [Music] okay identify boys engagements so there 's quite a few year as you can see and there are even over

decided to videos additional responsibility payments until after the election and people this paper is here to put their step total back to you information two and three of the scene this movies so emergency management Vince 's Road loading with their style and in the monkey Nepal County representative group there of some additional information in terms of the appendix which needs to be completed for the renovation authority to have a look at and even the council approves or recommends that remuneration authority will have the final say in terms of whether they fit and our recommendation so we 're supporting a recommendation year we would pick a failure between five percent to twenty five seen by seller is pre anti-air to go to appendix three and position here as they pour the tea rice over can apply only represents approach to this one page one three four and that entails yes quite a little they editing the themes and that have you as a little pull for it from the allocation that we 've got your applications okay well the scales around whether we would even ever tight at these years and that the work learners is requiring and yet one has enumerated the eastern work ladies ring invited the coordinate so to us lead off for the one you can selenium I think there are a few other councils in the country where they don 't running right for sure 's responsibilities and organizations like our almost always do in it is quite a significant amount of extra work and I think we need to respect that if you ask people to take responsibility and more work why wouldn 't we when you have not affair with a painting a fortune and people put a huge effort into this job I think with the three recommendations it 's absolutely appropriate Thank You Jerry and I would see connection this having castle innocent oh it 's yours earrings goes to support Cancer Agency report oh no that 's not good money coming to stationary value responsibility I give them to those particular committees and all the support the I 'm not we 're go to agree this immense odds certainly support the okay we should get as supportive if he gets been to before I 'm very thingy and I ever just have a question though what 's the rationale behind that interesting for our community versus 15 percent for the other chief it 's just in terms of the delegation so the linking of programming representative group as an advisory group they 've got very limited delegations and in terms of decision making the images have dropped terms of making and of Easter to them more more delegations persevere through the chair I just wanted to I guess add another I met a perspective into into the discussion really and I 'm more in support of additional payments to choose will do with the greatest of respect for the work that is done by tears but I guess these three points I just wanted to make to add em to the conversation and a different end of the day kids are just the first well-known political term all elected officials and members need to prepare for meetings or community are all councillors are involved in community and gaining understanding and a lot of the work that is done the agendas and minutes is actually done by staff so if it 's the first point I wanted to make and I guess the second point I wanted to make us work not here for the money none of us are because frankly if you took my hourly rate and divided it by the hour of them here it actually paying myself to be here but the money that we receive is called an honorarium and honorarium by definition payment made and recognition the extra service for which customs were billed the price to the state and by its very nature it 's voluntary in nature and that 's actually what close calls us all of the little officials about giving back to the community to that community service and no one peer select a team and the third point I wanted to make it at a time where locals out there are struggling to pay and as a council we 've got some significant investment and decisions to make in the future ahead and I don 't think it seems the right signal to the community to be giving ourselves and increase at this time and I think we need to operate in a concrete way every dollar counts and the only remuneration act over those and make these increases and you know I know you hear today that there are some councils around but do do that and it doesn 't mean that we should have to follow so I would be a Catering no increase and a quick question I did have to Tina two points I thought 15% with the upper limit not 25 25 our cheeks maybe I was looking on old 8 put people first same as the upper limit of information from the remuneration Authority is only forest and I guess the other point I just like to make is when we do both on this and if you are a cheer that is going to receive a financial increase the cover of s I would think that was consider that when you voted thank you I 'm just a little thank you can sue don 't and so my last comment that is would they be correct yes and there will be up to the members to decide whether they have a conflict there is a peculiar bandage cool boy okay why do you have a recommendation the year as per the appendix do I ever move up please but cancer Lincoln see you libido so clingy it wasn 't okay so I I those are geeks no and I 'd like to be recorded patient who is will be same from version 3 I 'm saying says it still enough to carry it up yep cool okay so three of sang the drivers of sometimes can still pack click on

financial perspective and X right across the organization whether it 's the income from community facilities like the bars and things of this nature or regulatory what the whole business it 's performed outstanding and be graded every year we could end up with a net surface as favorable as showing on this particular page and if we look at the scenario because may is a rates month that 's why um drugs such a high level of cash investments and amid borrowings s down at 32 million people get hung up about our borrowing as 148 and I think just as important as our net borrowing that 32

waiting for okay so that 's what I 'm kind of resistant it 's a sheet a lesbian things gone away and live that great movie that seven or six to eight weeks when you listen to complete the route to get the transformer out there yes okay thank you sorry Caroline I 'm transporter for the first footpath is aware that to our construction they we 're the only team that and I 'll be commencing and probably six to eight lakes if another project up until about soldier ball before I can get on without that this is an area of struggling to find generous thank you transport a and just bailing poisonous if there 's any questions about transfer thank you by roadsides [Music] some of these that 's why he 's drunk yep so as I wanted to follow through them pretty strong in this area are familiar as I said to before the summer house who 's got a cool summer so the plot the political year in terms of events just either fuel for and some the economic impacts of that so the indoor bounce session not sure is a phrase I would use our indoor bowls but humming but it 's an Italian parsley was kind of important women to the town so that 's I 'm just get follow for our conversations of smelling so importantly and cellphones is to add to the district this is never slow down here and now we start getting Soviet month or so so how do you know that shoulder season and then the team and kicking in terms of projects the the members hope under the autumn a key stream and so let 's go through design stage at the moments on on person produced sites about that one I think everyone around here should be with it on his desk and hopefully by the summer we 'll have end quite amazing projects on the go go down there yes that 's where goes save a little for me Thank You Johnny idalis a better here nice water view recent place with toilet no next week our bond project into giving me tenders for it oh geez that 's the second time it 's been out tinder release it another couple of months and like we can do about that weasel understand which one to grab together the two any less will open flat land I 've spoken about that previously and I just just remembers information and lastest from maps we have been doing of CC to the condition assessment of racial lines of the completed of many female completed for Maori plated CBD and turn here and that 's we see that our very profile for the next blank a plan certainly but in my head you know is gonna be significant remove the third rock Mario Rico and away with realigning the pets there and that 's I 'm in advance of putting on a new treatment plant there and the CBD work when we originally thought we had a lot of old pipes they are they 're actually a pretty good neck and I will flex and repeals today that they 're quite minor in comparison to what we brought we 're doing quite a bit admit earring at the moment that 's it okay so base sort of ice probably business as make climate that is we 're going into their own foam than we anticipated hope we can do a better that I know we are working with and contractors to try and minimize it as much as possible but given the construction that secure it 's a limited amount we can do in any way and still now similarly that 's business is a token device that 's going on at the bottom entirely the road we expect to hit that finish by the end of this week it 's actually closed off to the public and that 's great yeah yeah yeah fine if you go fast not good secured and guard the every night as well thank you this any questions our gym some light some water

early on and June the decisions that counselor made it those deliberations have been incorporated there is one addition that I wanted to include which is on page 31 which is the addition of a bullet point which is a pendulum team plane which is development of the total catchment documents with mapping to Pretoria in the Waikato Regional Council following our from a to futur treaty settlement process and there is a momentum planet sort of an included infusion so I 've got copies of this passport if you 'd like to take one away and other than that I do so at the time to our roles as they obviously the world vision fund appeared the design will take place following adoption today and will be undertaken throughout July to extend an invitation to in counsels to provide photos that they

of the 260 I know it 's simple percent of those who said mustard on it particular measure and okay does that notification good luck so 74% of submitters supported a preferred option and abilities a not great no it 's submitted on that particular issue so in terms of the analysis of the question isn 't where files how many submitters that was issued by our Moodle it 's in before the scene of the 260 agreed that 's not yet okay you should see me focusing on them so talk about a comment about or the building year so can we change it slightly Thanks okay right any other person nearing no but anyway I 'm sure the questions with the members solution glasses there 's any questions I 'm happy to answer page 136 C 61 D LM crucial PVC so that building project when million dollars what does it include what 's because it not a need is that one of the shiftiness of the design is that what is it the the allowance of million dollars here is basically for the investigation and feasibility work associated with the new building options so still I believe originally we were told I think a finger Lisa was a hundred thousand what 's the next stage cost wise which would probably come into the writing plane over about eight million dollars in tooling investigation and all that work is done and costed we won 't have that a range of optional sorry so they work the masses together and resolutions we will start with at any cost Center that will be Canales twin intelligences and he was independent it won 't be illegals that had been waiting decision you might not be arrested letters to be renewed or in and whatever location it is obviously these design and the facilitation costs they don 't events I lost money would be a wall into know exactly you know through there a bit of a peacefully thumbs we don 't know what they doesn 't all you might be decision to be an additional mass regards of shifting to the other premises made no decision and forward L 2001 budgeted that you made absolute in addition to best which is an investigation in design okay okay any other questions in trying to get the actual the actual right the rates number today they 're red cries no not at two point four percent a beautiful and what was in the nineteen twenty two point five four three twenty five point is also down by five million dollars from them and so the closing date position is also down from the LTP by two million dollars okay generally this malaria is the average really any other cancers checked out what these may be going up but I think we 're Michigan and I manage the world Olivia from man we valuations came out on the research survived between urban expenses in your programs nice and really increases with other capital very ie failure of improvements of at any point you all think but my general rate which is funded because of the capital really just seems any point something in a bereavement to me the mind it will they delay bailing you had a youth man regimes of

've gone for the in your own process and we 'll put all our ideas on year so basically and we 've been achieved and doing the work as well and achieving that there is enough stuck with an L financial strategy and they 'd come and they 'd lower than the forecast my long-term plan for both the rights and the DS worship and a quick question and the what were the main contributors to mmm through the chair is a number of base one is that because I think strong financial performance this year we 've got more cash than we intended also the deferment of some of the capital works if you take that right and we will escape so middle of cable expenditure has not being quite as great as we thought it would be so beautiful okay all right now thank you this one it understands for some of those

    "text": "that 's a minke hot stream cultural and ecological and handsome project in the frozen mascara yeah through the geologist introduces given a is around the concept plans for a trophy stream project we represented and workshop last Tuesday basically the project is you know the start of hook a forest walking track you will see from the report their lease between it a massive increase from 2005 at five hundred people our data 2016 to fifteen hundred people are doing now the project seeks to enhance this popular area the key issues the area and which are well articulated in a report out know recruit recollection of the cultural significance to the site from former Modi erosion so this river erosion also Trevor corrosion pushed toileting damage of reaffirms and also increased number of complaints around threatening behavior in that under around that site so the decision we 're asking today is to approve the concept plans and go to detail design antenna so with that the report is being read but since it was a it works you they couldn 't like the workshop of us Fraser just four lives thank you come up any second but until they do and language the income raise it will use the ones in the agenda that 's okay so the first one is just to clarify the site itself that anyone who hasn 't been there it 's the confluence of the Oh tamika 's a hot stream and the Waikato River it 's about a hundred meters by hundred meters the site with the the river it 's what would the stream itself in the middle of the site there 's three ownerships turkey ownerships that pertain to the site so is utterly we trust so this is on page 88 especially we trust to the north east there 's a film sort of department of conservation land running up the river there 's the two photo Maori Trust Board land with the white hair River and the council to sell as well I 'm going to report the the site problems our army is theft clinking Dennis two endangered foods which run up the the unique ecosystem that the hot stream allows is erosion as mentioned so that the amount of just a huge amount of catchment that comes down from spar Park through this site and there 's a real lack of legibility of outside when we get there you don 't understand what you 're dealing with really does no there 's no signage that explains the cultural value of this site there 's no there 's nobody get changed there 's nobody used it I taught it at all and there 's there 's nowhere to linger longer there 's no there 's no nice class areas for people to spend time there and taken the patria surroundings because the until this comes up the next step would be to go to the plan itself eerie enhancement that we 've proposed is to address one of the issues that we 've we 've uncovered through the site so I say one other thing to add is that we 've we 've worked really closely with the stakeholders on the site so it 's not only the landowners but there 's also the police and the Regional Council and the people who use it the tourists walk through from if we start at the so small but if we start at the bottom of the page and at the top the to the main change there is to bring in a threshold experience so that 's page a do page 90 sorry on the agenda notice a slightly but it 's also a three so the threshold experience is important so that people as soon as I get the advanced or importance of this place and its cultural meaning so that where the attitudes have changed because that 's the main thing we try and change here people are turning up and treating it they 're trashing it basically and through you know Bush toileting rubbish litter and then the antisocial behavior that goes along with that so we 're just trying to change people 's mindset from the very upset when I get there so that could take other that thrift shop experience would be signage but also working with to 5 and part we were having some some copper elements so some carpet over there as well the least element or the next next so because we because of the location or the vicinity to the Waikato River which is a landscape area of significance and a district plan we 'd like to reduce the bulk of that there structures so nestled into the bank that provides us to up to news that reduces the volk of the structure itself but it also allows us to use the roof as a viewing platform which will help with the passes of violence issues that we have on this site so if you 're in the stream or you 're on the site then you 're doing something you shouldn 't be doing is that opportunity that someone will just pop up on that platform and see you and most thieves are notoriously shy so they don 't like that and the next feature is to improve the access to the sites at the moments very steep access track down there the regrading that track will improve that access then the next feature is to deal with the erosion excuse me so we 're lining that track will help deal with the erosion that comes off erosion we 're looking to deal deal with that with features that are in keeping with the environment so some rock placements and plantings also we love having the bridge further up the stream helps us helps reduce the need to worry about that erosion because at the moment we 've got infrastructure right next to an A rating bang which is not ideal so we like having it those two things that deals with that erosion issue but it also removes that troll like experience that we 're providing for people and one of our lot and why though which should be one of our best treasures really the worst we 're not treating it like that the the next element which will really help with the passive surveillance is the proposed kiosk that part we want to put on the land which is which is the northern means you can see so we 're proposing to put two multiplied shipping containers deal with an outside decking area and two coffee and tea and cool drinks and they want to do that for two reasons it 's a great the car to young lee seunggi of this area very seriously and they want to be a part of improving this area it should be an image of the circus so this is the toilet block I on it which I need to know the viewing pleasure one toilet toilet underneath and a changing area at the front and in some lockers which are coin they operate by coin exchange so there 's no money kept on site and I take the risk to the paper is red are there any questions shipping containers is that the latest thing is it or yeah because that 's quite nice building that sort of box quite a aesthetically yeah there 's no way they kept a concessionaire could sort of end up looking a little bit like that as well no Nora no every checking these in the later late in the year the bottom the bottom image there shows that what they what they were proposing that 's probably very smooth like I 'll make it out but a couple of things on Tim intend to that one as this the your decision that painted a shipping container Bobby the Syrian village that we were in our mind the petrol report with all the ugly shipping containers you a they can be made quite nice and the one with a local one with the one a total point which is a little cafe there which I must thank you Josaphat I 'm I was just going to say I 'm think you and I really enjoyed the interactive and which upward pottery we trust the other day but it was great to have them sitting alongside us and talking to us about this as I mentioned the other day I just don 't know if one male and one female choice was going to cut it but I just sort of think if we 're going to do this we need to properly into the future price because the projected numbers are huge so I just wonder in the design whether they can give some options on more toilets pens perhaps and also and that we will also have the opportunity to look again at some central government funding possibly so should be good and I think that we we really lack in our district to others as we don 't have that cultural tourism experience or those stories the other areas have and we need to start doing the emotive think this is a really exciting project to get that stuff underway and sort of lead the charge so I 'm quite interested with the resolution to go out for tinder and design aesthetically basically the toilets at the workshop and it was mentioned by at the time probably 1500 people are going going through this facility which is going to increase I 'm just wondering my true value of the changing facilities well because I don 't know perhaps even mail but sort of the females I think prefer to go into a to a tallit facility to a change sooner than the out in the open as you might say you know in a room so I 'm just wondering whether or not some of the changing facility could cut down a little bit them and further toilet facilities just the candidate assigned okay we 've already had paints nobody thinks Jim I agree with and cancel attack against their king I had a cope with an injury to this and just hire it how they met according to me about and also a list today 99% of people is arriving the being so they 've got their kid on when they get to the polls we all threw the bait papers they 're told to make sure they got their clothes your togs sorry can on and off but the one about the bathrooms is nothing very important where you can do a possibly the changing rooms but incorporate them with maybe two more Torah facilities is a cross say exercise so that phase I just I 've done a few cycles down here was we don 't really saying is typically that you 're doing excitement you know they 're taking photos of people but a lot of people are still getting changed down there with the Taos is probably most of them here in Commission ID but yeah I think it 's important yes yeah one more cancer Rincon one of the good issues it lockers is that and I and I know people are going to look around the scene but it 's not enough it 's in a public places probably you know there 's limited things that we can do having those trust there there 's going to be a huge help the thing that the police were really hot home was having a look at Danielle knew that would help with that I don 't know but that it would help the whole feel of the place it was a policeman who suggested to me that he thought we should have something exposed thing where people can put their being some stuff that everybody can see so if you went up and took the wrong one when I don 't know that he did not use that and can I am the designer it does look like a pal station actually my nature and architecture might be solar-powered though interesting you can talk later sorry for this make sense 2015 funds reallocated and he 'll TP primary is the tortoise apartment rooms or no Aurora scopes change press releases but that wistful based on that initial proposal the scope that 's a key change might be a look like just on the M because University campus University and to our concept the appeal iam were the exist all the struggles of the wrist gents will not receive soon for government funding but it wasn 't voice for night I know there 's I know and as their aggression thing bigger across the three quarters a million dollars is a bit of a bit of i knows it 's a bit of a breakdown we come to it I mean that 's why we say that tells us we hesitation to give you a budget now to be approved and saying this go out to to tender and see what comes in and see what what it does is it 's a relatively unique job rather deserve so so it 's really quite a scale in terms of what that dollar amount really is a syndicate of what 's the year yet we can we could give a space to the fashion field back to and to the level that was at that but I guess what this is is a combination of a cumulation of a whole lot of work with those those interested parties and what they 've got for to you as of the beast so our recommendation of the stages if we go up a teamed up and see how much it does and then talk about we their funding can come from and part of that can be potentially going back to central government as council Park talked about through the funding centuries and development contributions which we don 't we lose and there could be other funding screen of the year as well so so we 're sort of suggesting it may be that a subsequent decision so you in the current you know in theory limitations for government funding will be unalloyed to be approved specifically project it could be it could once once you 've been approved on something then well service it is a for the whole project you know notwithstanding comes the bodies and counselor the clings and castle cogs comments about the toilets configurationally so mr. chairman are we gonna get to do it the stages so we ensure that we 've got the funding towards first along with the protection of their own links and things like that then maybe the next step which is which we may warden we 're you know we 're going to do intended for a tune to me but it 's going to be split up into stages so we 'll catch for toilet blocks ippity moving works in the erosion control as well and that will bear forward over it so the next long term or clean so each year we 've allocated something to continue with the investment no come back to us so this is just going to give us a indication of budget okay I need to be as decided later duck thank you thank you worship and I would definitely prefer to do the holodeck I think this is a little bit light for a walker and a trifle me down through the year and Spartan Park was developed some 35 years ago on a PEP scheme government school this is probably the first expenditure major expenditure Spartan reports landowner suits yeah I think it looks awesome when we finished it and I would say go for the go for gold chains okay Casa hack do move it email vehicle I have a second a place for the recommendation letter P because it thank you can see my calculus all

been elected to do that take the capital for your support okay thank you cash back any other items of clarification on those minutes that in the case could I have a movie please for those months we 've got canceled faxing the by cancer Williamson always unfavorably so I tie against carry item and a 3.2 extraordinary meeting council meeting on the 16th of May in email is arising from those minutes mr. chairman cats the body Amasa genesis wimpy weapons that I 've been have what I 'm about to bring out for in good governance and my job as a council for this district I must the first the show is to raise regards of that particular meeting and this is not overly serious in regards of the out increase of leasing buildings our sight would not increase when effect on rights I think that would be quite easy to say that if you 're spending nine hundred thousand dollars because you 've had a good year they took you had a hundred thousand dollars at kalbarri screen at around available terrace in the street or rabbit we 're out of Arab term what 's the court norman 's mystery however my real concern and this comes down to the good government 's part was that we set the alphabet meeting we were given a number of papers I think it 's a bit over 30 pages one of the 22 pages wrong which was from gather and associates that did the ear monitoring and will read through these letters or they can be very concerned about the whistle formation that had been given out about this this particular building official act referred to the learners and Berman Bates and climate lawyer civil litigation on this evening right down they state that they have not seen any report to documentation but understandably will conclude my first question is where did they get that from certainly moving so when I read the letter from the PSA in regards on the pingers house deep concern about start talking domicile in this building and we read the first paragraph that says all right to express and the strong as possible terms appear sighs do consume them the discovery of Harlow experiences in the tap recording blah blah and they 're disappointed that some a crucially need to the kite the premises this will have a different head on the health well-being of our members I want to my who those counselors that were pushing the need to negate the premises so what I did I ran bring back a the Mason City to reimpose the Christian will the information come from and responds rightly was from our psi delegate so as in conversation we missed the back leg I said to him do you realize that you 're monitoring that 's been done and there 's no asbestos done during this building and basically his words except rates we know and I realized the Christian listen the May why was he not include that the asbestos in brackets supposedly this famine August of last year and why haven 't his members here or himself raise those issues so you know that are willing to an associate 's website and what consumer was this first spoke any website in the gaseous boosters now really because I think it 's applicable and the substance awesome the invention of the realest pieces in spirit a state of panic which in many cases is not justified we will the state of panic is not and compounding the news of the public files via lieutenant having something to what can only be described as scare tactics are the to risk by revealing average or by third parties which is again these misconception so then you wait there when I was at home what 's my next course of action so many degrees of action was the content the two countries concerned clear safe and gather and associates as the conversation would start with Darwin associates who were the one is the document we can look at the 22 pages on the 16th states in Lucas do a telephone conversation concerning his business issues I hadn 't even thought lateral incisors perfumed integrability the girls identified among father materials which means fathers are integral is amidst materials daily competed with our there is innocence there 's a slim anatomic damage to some new headings of either the Mara Shannon must address this the door should be encapsulated repealed in the be ages pipe shield and these opposes no problem inking minute Institute in fear ongoing concern around the damaged material the memory of that material will be drama solution the other experience contain material did to be in good condition and therefore can be managed in Scituate are the way management is conducted on the salt and layer clear below the root iced tea keep some of it was 0.01 area where there 's abundant of species contain materials and all sorts of applications to advance to the other buildings of all types nationwide as long as this piece containing materials that could be good condition in our dinner Florida managed according to the health and safety work exclusively relation of 2016 then the crunch it is my opinion as long as the event products priestess is renovated and managed includes the devil 's report the others report the building is safe for occupation so I really had a conversation was a girl called sign of Robinson 's manager of clean sites in active conversation she put her life in the following reveal of this is the one that the delivery port that was in here with all the father 's on progress because if any one problem this was his response as per our telephone conversation area and the timeliness alias missus remote was when a condition considered safe for no activities to proceed in origin the conformists and it did and then they go on event experimental plane because there 's me on our risk management so I 'm going to say that I believe we 'll be living Island dated with skiing tactics with algae sex we have not had any of the three countries that that had done surveys on this building and addresses I tried from day one to the air monitoring done that funding took place described right now wrong is that we put on hold in three attempts to leave this building until we exit I 'm really going to rebuild if by public opinion they decide to go here if you living the property is not common if we decide to opt out and go somewhere else these buildings a syllable from control continued occupation thank you any other questions clarification of these moments where we discuss this minute I would confirm in the minutes here so there 's some wanting to discuss any medicine fantasies minutes I 'm happy for that but what do we do to achieve what do we do that information that they hadn 't been clear circulated obviously most most councillor we are the situation and that would come to chemistry mr. Chairman I would suggest that it is council either wants the Christian what I 've just sees and Christian the minutes be a variety this council Adler 's had not been informed of what 's wrong or right with this building you can do reports but neither exam them filling or contact and candles concerned hints the results is my Directioners you 're entitled to your belief like all the other castle in time it 's not like it 's what I 've been told by the experience I 'm most pieces nor you thank you all right any other questions or queries or plant types points of clarification of these moments right okay could I have a mover for these my place wait a minute my counselor King each seeking the right council heckling all those in favor please say aye against carry all right cool really Oh point one for the chair I know we 've accepted the fate of the menage I 'm counselor body has raised measure arising from those minutes we 're going to discuss that matter I would like an explanation and light of the looters that mr. Boddy is heads from these companies that we don 't need to vacate the building and they put it in writing is that right John great great and I 'm not going to have a discussion about that the most have been confirmed that there 's no direct understanding oversight there any topic that them relax as we can because as to what we 'll need at that meeting my suggestion is that if you want to discuss the city there would need to be subject of a agenda item if you 're not on television horizon is amazing to see any apatite precipitation well I 'm absolutely incredible that council has decided to ignore the advice that X device from three companies that were involved was or didn 't introduce war demolition to sit there and more asked for it to be fully discussed today before it 's been right as my that maybe not needed if we do not build on the side _"

    "text": "we 'll go to item three which is three point one no summation humor would suggest that if you need further information to the discussions that I could I 'd like to have that presented before my motion has put certainly thank you everybody I understand that mr. green has as chief executive has some information to that thank you emotion thank you worship and so I filled it out to you this morning a lot of information and unfortunately it is a relatively big amount of information to hand out at the last minute and I acknowledge that reason for the lateness is that literally the last of the the pieces only came through this morning about team and applause before we walked into the room and so what you have theaters to run you through is you have some asbestos reports from from a couple of New Zealand 's experts talking about the theory you see in the might be noted that here just so just one about year do you mind just commune but in the end how are you hearing it back there Richard yep they so this does reports from without someone was doing this talking about the the risks of the SPS off of the building albeit I 'll go through those a little bit more detail in a second you 've got a letter from a employment in health and safety Lisa lawyer that that counsel that I asked for some information on around your liabilities our liabilities and you 've also got a letter from the Public Service Association which was received this morning and the PSA being the Union for a large number of staff and the building then obviously New Zealand 's largest Union as well and so I must only you wouldn 't have had a chance to read both and so I 'm just wondering your worship whether or not councils may wish a few minutes or whether or not you wish Gareth or myself to walk you through those documents I think possibly give us say 10 minutes now and we can just read them and then Epstein Walker 's frozen as it 's a councillors do you happy with it obviously just tabled information this morning would be a good thing are there copies for the deck being handed out yeah okay so Tim with ten minutes and more RAM so it 's bedtime ten reps mr. green you could just lead us lead us through it in good morning mr. Garrett Robinson and Karen and groggy out of the team here this point so nice to see you guys okay yeah thank you worship so yeah so I used to before I give them today I decide to profess the discussion by by saying they asked staff none of us want to leave this building the decision that we 're asking you to make today is not one there that we want to do this for a whole lot of different reasons but it 's really you 've you 've tasked me with building a culture of this organisation us being split into five different locations around the town center is not something that 's going to make my job any easier we don 't think this is fun and we don 't want to do this but we are in a place where we and responsible for the health and safety of the staff the organization and in you are as well under the Health and Safety Administration as you 're aware I take the responsibility obviously very seriously of quality and regardless of your ultimate decision as to what you do with this building the one that you make the decision that you 're making at the end of June and staff have to leave this building so if your decision is the the minimus option so just to remove the SPOs risk from from the building and do the earth clay strengthening during national struction phase staff can 't_''_217.859 be in the building so we have to leave the building so this is really about a matter of timing as a matter of whether or not staff leave now or staff leave post you making whatever decision you make and at the end of June in terms of the mobilization for change takes a long time what I mean by that is that we early in the phase that we 've been out talking to landlords and looking at alternative locations if today for us to relocate it 's going to take quite a considerable amount of time to fit the building 's out into progressively move staff out and to move this number of staff there 's a whole lot of work that needs to be done even from Tifa tout perspective so it 's not a quick decision the decision that you make today will still be going when you were making your decision is to to wear ultimate home is going to be and are you so the question then in the questioners are if that 's subject to the notice emotions around the question of be born asbestos and is your see from the reports that you 've got blue and we have annotation the ear monitoring that was requested and that talked about in the notice emotion and clearly that that tea stain shows that at the current time at the time of the monitoring the the standards were not exceeded okay so there 's best offs in the year did not exceed the standards at the time the monitoring was undertaken the report goes on to site so the soil clearly was contaminated which means that at a point in time asbestos was in that year for the entered land onto the soil so I 'd say ear monitoring is all well and good but it 's a better point in time and it 's at that point in time when the five weights be estas is disturbed and therefore receive warm and so therefore exceeds the standards the important thing is about the condition of their those SB estas panels and the condition of those panels and the reports that you have in front of you show that the conditional raised panels are fragile and prone to to further damage and on top of it you 've grabbed a Lisa from Loyola which we 've given to you from Brandon Bates we would provide a brief Lisa because obviously as a result of whatever decision we made today there are certain liabilities on us and I think it 's fair to say when you read through that lore is Lisa and there are two things which stand out for me one is that you do to keep the staff safe and in the second really important one for me that stands out is that cost is in a consideration when it comes to health and safety and particularly for our council when cost yes we 'll all seem sort of is to two rapes and a value of rate but you have quite the ability to to find practical options and in you 've got that in terms of the the financial NZ practical options of finding us alternative locations in town so that 's the lawyers letter and we 've got a user from the PSA which were to write this morning and which I can only say when it 's an open letter which has been sealed to the media as well I understand I can only say that it is a relatively strongly worded I won 't use the word threat but recommendation method should a decision be not made the PSA will take whatever steps they need to take to protect the health and well-being obvious of being members and it goes through the talk about the health and safety legislation to pipe River and what the legislation has done has made it really clear that employees shouldn 't in can 't_''_440.149 put themselves in a place of risk and these provisions were made out for employees through health and safety committees of the workplace to actually stop with and in their workplace and refused to put themselves into a place agree that 's not a decision that u.s. council Lords or me as your chief executive can make it 's a decision that those employees are empowered under the legislation to take themselves so it 's a decision outside of our control they haven 't our staff haven 't made that decision but I think when you read the PSAs letter it 's clear that that 's that 's on the cards and I go further to say that there 's the distilling date that you 'll be asked to make today on those two items and it actually not about whether or not we stay in this building or not make decisions mind to make a decision that I 'm asking you to make today is about whether or or not you 're prepared to enter into those leases and therefore commit us financially okay so to be really clear it 's my decision whether or not we stay in this building and from a health and safety perspective I 'm telling you that we cannot stay in this building so if you really not make the decision today in terms of internet to these other leases in we still won 't be sitting here it 's just that you 'll be forcing me into a place where need to try and find alternative locations to what our staff that doesn 't subject to the resolution that you 're going to be asked to make so there 'll be other council notations it would be staff working from home so those those cultural issues that I talked about the challenges that go into these other sites have going to be sites in town would be far worse and if we if we were put into that place it 's not a place I I want to go to and hopefully that you don 't and although it feels pretty dealing with people 's lives and that 's what I don 't want to overstate them I do want to overstate that it 's not overstating it I think on the real you aware of people that have bit of suffering from asbestosis at the moment as a condition which doesn 't come it 's not something like a paper cut or a stubbed toe so it doesn 't show itself immediately so the decision that you make today won 't come through today the decision that you make today will be shown in ten twenty thirty years time not when you 're sitting around this table I for one don 't want to be the person that people look back to and say that guy didn 't do everything that he could for me not the Peter kodik and alterative leases that you 've got in front of you in terms of the the second item 3.2 and they 're not perfect and officers of Danny obese to try and find somewhere which which is going to enable the operation to continue in its best form we 've looked customer service component continue we 're in and about four different other locations specific teams a yet to be 100% determined about where they go but we do know that we can set your body into those into those locations as I started it 's not ideal it definitely is an ideal it 's not something that we want to do so you wish up other than that and I think you 've got the information in front of you and carry myself a happy to answer any questions and but I suggest that you need to deal with first is notice emotion and then if if they 're successful then obviously that 's the end of the matter now if I 'm successful then we need to go on to item 3.2 okay thanks thanks mr. green so clips just any questions from the counselors regarding the specific points of clarification is that okay ask you some questions any points of clarification regarding these reports obviously the p-side lid is quite clear in the law really is quite clear so just regarding the actual dose situation counselors counselor hickling thing pretty much dropped on our table again the report from the people that have done the asbestos testing could you just go through it and and just get us some some kind of photo what reports really scientists place if so I 'll ask and delegate to do that is worth the ticket mister I 'm gonna just ask the counselors that the young Darryl and associates workers so we engaged on Dowdell to do a second confirmation report that we have asbestos in this building in done this is a high-level result it 's a visual inspection that enriches the samples because the impression was would just be throwing them good money off the bed samples have been tested in it 's been legally documented they so when I said there 's a high level and their first summary page is an like my interpretation of this document would be to read it from start to finish and then you would get a really good understanding what it 's all about if you just took the family it sounds quite simple to just say our step a better in context so just encapsulating asbestos with paint is it 's not as easy as it sounds and the light on the report day they refer to the fact on page 22 that you cannot use a high pressure water blaster to wash the bottom so we regained a logistical problem on how we get staff well contractors to wash the building by hand and then I even the parts that are not compromised can be encapsulated in paint the rest of the stuff has to be removed and even other food to the fact that general contractors can do it also lead to the fact that they don 't recommend it because of it takes a specialist contractor to remove asbestos and make sure that they 've got all the safety gear in place so just cutting it out and replacing it is not as easy as it sounds and you would still be in a situation we we are compromising our staffs health and safety to give a little bit of a clear understanding encapsulation for fatherís basically becomes airborne in a world come here born the moment to create a negative pressure in order that is first it doesn 't contaminate the heart the whole area around in obviously impact on the public as well yeah in terms you can imagine a big bubble in create a ramp front section of this building it 's a really difficult thing to do and especially when you 've got staff house yeah so I do talk about you going into a management report which would be stage 2 where they actually take full assistance of this building EQ writing fire risks either the burden can roll as a spec and that could dive a lot deeper in sign where we actually going forward with this building but subsequent to that we have had reports from Baker and in shield decided we don 't have a good EQ writing in this building so I refer that we 've done that homework already I clean you got me okay the moment so what I 'm sorry achieve here was it negative creating negative pressure was it what they did similar it will sounds were the Medical Center guess it back so get it right where you see that the through showed contamination so there has been airborne must be stopped Rick thank you it 's a clarify be no airborne suspicious at the moment but as soon as something 's disturbed that creates the airborne it 's a better point in time so his question there obviously has been um you 're born in the past and then for the saw to be contaminated the way that it is and obviously that happened what the vandalism which happened there as well whether or not it 's happened before or whatever not sure the moment the asbestos is disturbed then it becomes airborne for the period of time that it 's in the air and the visual inspections that you 've got is that the the asbestos is in a bad state at the moment so we 'll be airborne at a particular point in time Tim thank you disappointed in the comments made by mr. Robinson 's and regards to the painting we mean any cancers real in the 26th I think it was off last month and you agreed with nation 's that has to be taken at the pointers you can paint the second question the doctor versus is when a building a blue asbestos you may have a talk to wood demolition the generally and I 've told you this or really but for the people at the back but if you were basically in any town or city in New Zealand you would be exposed to probably most pieces they 're standing on this building so I 'm just wondering mr. chairman that when we ask and the sword was taken away I think was at the back here somewhere they a monitored what was there monitor readings for asbestos so they took all protective measures together da platoon kept selected area and that 's why in the air monitoring there was nice vistas it was exposed so they 've managed to remove this stuff without compromising the integrity of this business but the building was in a little bit of a different scenario because of the fact that he hadn 't they were ears that hadn 't been compromised and it was easily removed whereas the been compromised that becomes a lot more difficult to achieve it so the external monitoring that was done was done within if you like a team rather than such a national street corner to see what was in the air so that their debts a different type of asbestos that up in the back to the prefect there was four five and six so that don 't using encapsulation to do it they 're just doing open air monitoring system in work area that they 're weakening so the American system ended their job showed no asbestos in the ear trick because they managed to remove it without compromising receiving taken the point of mr. greens in regards of a point in time what point in time do we actually end up looking at if we continue to or Gramma 's building to the next five years what would be the asbestos in the losses universe around town so the fact the front of this building is you know deteriorating state is what raises the concern for us the fact of the prefab wasn 't in a deteriorating state thank when if we get to three point two the prefab is a building that will still be used because even though it has asbestos it doesn 't have we 've taken it all the way right I understand thank you okay so I 'm always saying then that even when this building is clad wrapped to demolish the staff in the pre Propst will still be working there and safe in mint environment so we are hopeful of that I mean but that won 't be able to be too finally determined until close to the time when we know what the scope of works are that you that you were doing and there were two parts of that one a safety which which the advice so far is that yes we could and second would be desirability was noise and dust and fine yes so infinitely the solutions that were coming up with at the moment are somewhat future-proof so that the solutions include the prefab at the moment but that the staff that we 're proposing to housing the prefab of those staff who spend most of their writing people compliance people on the life should become an untenable environment in the future then we would need to look at other alternatives to house them and then within the suggestions that were put into you today with those leases and other council facilities at Delaney Park of the depot etc we could temporarily house them it was the one skip is favorable Williams from what I 'm putting in to you today just a fish I 'm sorry just a question for me and through the to thank you it 's in regards to the brown and Bates League litter my outtake of reading this letter is all that you are simply doing is outlining our legal obligations in Judea we need to take under the Health and Safety Act and the asbestos regulations but it is not a comment on our individual situation because I note that they found point to they 've not seen any of our reports or documentation at this stage so it 's just a recommendation on our obligations not on what we 're doing here correct based on the Koch brothers thank 's comments on this leader because we go to eight on the second page we appreciate this business is not currently a blur all right any other you shouldn 't really cheerful so I clarified with eight you currently and it 's not even but there 's contaminated soils that has been airborne it 's become later all over topic all right and so vector 3.1 guess the Buddy wonder school overly nice motion yadi she 'll do other we did the emotion forward because my intent was not to and I made the common this chamber in the past that yes this building has asbestos clearly that 's not in dispute but I will dispute over is the fact that we 're going out for consultation with a number of options in regards of this particular building one of mr. stay here in rebuild there other options to leave the site and go elsewhere and with him Spiro Agnew in his primo resolution but we 've also had I think was the weekend that counting the tab I wanted us to move closer to town the reason for this those buildings no asbestos that the base on that side it commutes a new point at the moment if we decide to do website and then isn 't we can make that decision yet and this building is still workable or various and repairs that has to be done why we going to leave and have the cost of leasing outside this property and evidence means to the ratepayers so that 's why I 've as you see Barnett resolution about we haven 't made a decision yet which way we going and I believe until we do to a consultation has taken place we don 't take up those leases hits my resolution what are you moving that resolution I 'm making it for a second our second and I just would like to make a comment and support all councilor bodies comments look I don 't think there is any doubt in this room that we need to do something and we need to protect our staff and at some stage whether we rebuild and here we move somewhere else we don 't have to relocate our staff Act what I haven 't seen from Council was they 're actually in a space dog management plan we 've got a whole load of documents have come in at the last minute but we actually have a responsibility to develop a plan which covers many different aspects I 've sort of had a bit of a walk through this myself not being an assist of the exhibit expert but there are all sorts of things we need to do we need to develop management plan that looks at our processes how we 're going to manage accidents incidents how we 're going to talk to our staff and I think we 're operating a little bit in a section with a lack of information at the moment so I 'm also concerned that we don 't have a robust claim and I know that relocation is going to be an option but it also doesn 't pose risks for our business for a little of service that we 're going to offer our community and it is going to expose our staff to a whole raft of other health it if you add into the mix that were in the middle of consultation and at some of our options some of the disadvantages for them are at the length of time we 're going to relocate I really would like to have a discussion about when we leave this building because that may ultimately affect some of the final options that we look at and I think it 's premature so I will support count for the body 's motion council body councillor John 's son and ok anyone want to speak against resolution Casa pact I 've run it clean I 'm going to conventionally keep this legislation for exactly all the reasons that cats for John 's is voting for it and I 'm in a former while working for a local MP I came across many asbestos sufferers who were seeking compensation and apologies in quite a facialist eight years after the event of contracting the illness and I either an elected member and as a community leader in not support leaving and one of the largest teams of staff in this district and a building _''_1534.12 be in their own little ugly staff in this room and I really that finance team who sat down the front of the building near that soil neither and pedal which has been removed by vandals and so therefore I will not be supporting this notice emotion I think as soon as will empower our chief executive to get on and do its job and do it properly to be happens like anyone else like speak against me here yes through that you wish for essentially support council execute exactly the same way and she is given and prefers unconcerned as losers community know as well as well it 's not the relevance important that we show some leadership responsibilities are needlessly I mean the living defectives the ego and monitoring proponent at a point of time when to is not hasn 't mean showing a year born and the digital I was easily crumbled reduced apparent so there 's element of risk involved as too much risk is too much you are swimming to know here 's what the bill tired knowledge if you go for chemical into our what companies wine and but you know years of responsible decision maker they can remove them replace it to our intimate risk it so this where I staying as well so I won 't be supporting the emotion Casa Rincon I agree with my two previous colleagues and I 'm amazed that we would be willing over some dollars and that 's what we 're talking about to put the lives of our staff at risk I 'm horrified by I think we 've got a courageous chief executive because it isn 't easy in the public area they 've already hear about what we should do and what we shouldn 't do and some of it is incredibly emotional and very very harsh and it 's not taking into consideration the safety of our stuff I think he is courageous I think he 's going to make the right decision and I know that the culture has been building here what is fantastic including benefits the public is at risk and moving and he understands it but he hasn 't got a choice so I will be voting against the original Louvre that of a motion and would you like to make any rounding comments we 'll just like to make a something that its relevance and it was raised at the risk management meeting yesterday by our children as to why it took six months after the August reading is to for us to get where we are now and then I 'd like to ask councillor Park in regards of the monitoring that was done it came out at 0.01 which is no risk for those downstairs officers would make or believe that the soil outside that 's going to have an effect I 've seen before and I repeat again I know this building has a problem with asbestos cutting is asbestos in the building or the air cleaners on the outside what I 'm attempting to do is to come to the realization and if we do bound board off-site at least we 've got something to work through we 're working until that boom is complete I 'm not sure the total cost of is going to the top of the post office below decided where we going to build if our consultations is pull this thing down building in or do this bring up I 'm all in favor of moving out but really until we 've made that decision I don 't believe we could vote on it so that 's the reason for my motion thank you thank you buddy all right I 'll put the notice of motion how can I ask as to page number one all those in favor please say aye aye aye those against no so motion is lost all right item 3.2 Xenocide and we are William your worship and probably very quickly and that we 've probably covered most of the and the reasons behind the move so really what 's left is the specific sites that we 've looked at you 've got them near 21st Street righto Street home attorney Street Cafe view street in huger speed this was the best options that we could find we did visit every single it was single vacant office in an attempt these were the the necks they 'd be suited us it 's probably a lot of basement office space until which is a good thing from a market perspective so other than this there is one other large property which is as not on our list here which we did look at and unfortunately the the price of that wasn 't competitive I said delicately enough other than eight we would be reduced to two street front ground floor which wasn 't available so the only off my debut is I think the landlord 's involved table reduced the rates quite considerably partly because of the tombs that we 've offered them so it is a very competitive lease proposal that you 've got it okay cancer pack through the tear gas and reshape once before head staff located at Gillis be clever because it 's one of the bigger sites in town which would mean move staff which give s was they considered or is it what you would have met before then it is what I was going to before so yes we did consider that we wouldn 't all be putting into that one building we would have had to of their building were significantly higher to a large percentage it 's gonna lean the rumors they want it because they don 't work on the building at the moment and I think everyone or the conspiracy theorist thought that it was a done deal that 's what they 're doing there at the moment of high street smell bit the right and the only other thing I wonder that as accessibility for the public to council meetings and workshops and whatnot what was the plan around neck so accessibility for really customer service obviously the pumpkin cake will be the main area for one for our customers to come to Invermere in meeting spaces will also be located above the post being clear and and that doesn 't provide space for council meetings to be really to be really friend so we do in an inter stage of this would be looking at what do we do in terms of the it 'll not like to have a conversation with you guys collectively about that offline and so the options are they were you either dedicate a space and say on Delaney Park or similar that we could dedicate is a meeting space cyclist alternatively we could go into a cyclic sort of process that we use different venues in different months so you know from the case of a halt can lock halt things like that so there 's a discussion that I 'd need to have with you but to be really clear this proposal does not include space big enough and appropriate enough for the chamber so the public interface will be an old pumpkin page building needs to post-ops that 's great okay so the reason for that is that the pumpkin page building opposite of the shop front we can set up a customer service center if discs for dropping or hot distance for relevant staff that have the most contact with the public and there 'll be some meeting space there and then the likes of yourself your worship will be in the building above that which is connected by steel so it 's as closely as possible to be in one building all these other sites you know said once I wanted quite accessible to the public school and the prices will still be to come through that pumpkin patch so that 'll be our number one point of contact on the public in there will be for staff and that 's why we try to keep them quite tight but under sort of a hub-and-spoke model so the staff will be the ones doing that walking back to that very central location so our physical address will be the pumpkin patch tool you 're thinking what 's the position regards us back in that packing for staff and counselors so and so forth council tower some of the the sites come with some of the sites come with a what some car back so you arm for example the the site on shoo-shoo Street has has some car parks associated with it which will be used for and for staff sorry full vehicles so council vehicles used in the course of the of the day and for general staff there in forum for counselors as well and you will be the same as any other worker in the CBD in terms your interstate and their location and so for example the McDonald 's car park the car backed by the BP and for the building up by rebel sports there 's a car park right in the Nord a car park right next to that yes we will be doing some displacement of existing people they don 't currently pass in those sites but I 'll say that would be the same whether it was council renting those buildings on mass or if it was individual businesses yep economy were suddenly great in all those those shots were all those officers were filled by and by businesses anyway so it was jiminy when his sister put on the Carol 's in from fine thank you and I probably to say today we again have been through this process in the past when we last occupied Gillespie Plaza in parking for having run through that process parking for staff was a major concern all staff when we when we read to move I 'd say they 're very very quickly those concerns dissipated once we went there and people change their behaviors questions when it thanks care and if this motion is approved when do you think the move would start so the as soon as possible with the answer but the IT component does take some time to be able to take it fiber etc into the buildings which needs it and and fit out so basic use of the stage is that the first group of staff would start around about July and it would probably be about a two or three month process to get everyone out that 's I can 't understate us that 's a huge job to get this number of staff located from one side to the other and so in the interim till we wait until July what are we doing to ensure that this building because the safe as possible what practical steps are we taking to keep this building safe sure so the the area which is cordoned off at the moment which is the highest risk water will remain and remain there until then and we have also secured all of the windows on the front face of the building so _''_2185.23 risk in that regard and in other than that it 's a very much a ongoing monitoring program in sports program is things happen okay and just another question from Mary in terms of the discussion identifying with building suitability we 're not moving from one a fiscal situation to another great so we 've checked all these buildings out from and from asbestos and from an earthquake screening process you came and moving for because this was obviously going to be a two-year process or we as council get an opportunity just to have a look at what some of their risks are of having a spread out Council across the community for nearly two years I think we need to just have a plan on how we 're going to manage those risks and identify them because we haven 't covered any of that off to date and therefore something that is forefront in the mind of myself in your management team who you charge to do those operational things such as this and it is a it is a real risk in particularly the the silo nature the management teams initial thinking about who goes into which building has been within quite deliberate on this that seems to split teams up if you like to ensure that there has to be still that communication through and part of the design of what we 're coming up with is that the the building we 're the mill be located above the the post office will become a hub so that 's where our internal staff meeting rooms and things like that will be located so that 's the central point and everybody will be coming back leo keen to continue as much as we can there their culture in the discussions amongst the staff so again it 's not perfect but it 's the best that we can do know but it would be good to identify I mean that 's one potential risk you 've identified it would be good to sit down and work out what all those risks and what treatments we 'll put in place to help address some because two years as a long time there 's a long time we can habitable through all the rest so that we can see input measures in place and so example would be each of these sites has a senior manager associated with it who becomes like the overall next site is an examples of done within the weekend thank you okay thank you ever questions screen cancer treatment I just want to do and also look at retail my aquino until we do them to be really friend you are some stuff might like to be Thanks there are some staff who reside 1990 only and they will have options of working and those locations as they do now but more so into so all joking aside that is a real possibility and moving a larger number of staff wouldn 't be practical from a change management management perspective expecting people to commute away from their place of work and would be a major undertaking in a costly one of that but one thing that we are doing as we 've been looking at our technology offering any way across the business and so we 're very much looking at how we can enable one space to another whether other than these buildings or elsewhere and maintain I 'm telling you coming into that so part of that process part thinking I 'm back to councillor John 's question before is that each of these sites will have hot discs located in them and so that somebody 's got a meeting with a colleague but a hour gap in between they can store fill that time working in there and the other building any other questions of the see me today no okay so the recommendation page number six council water Isis mirin typically formalized leases with the owners of following properties twelve 2586 repay to 46 haram a tangy fourteen ruapehu and one one one huge tree which are probably just before you do put that just just wish to and probably look to mister mean he knows a little bit but just point out that the 800,000 whilst its unbudgeted as one of my tasks you just sort of talk about we that 's coming from okay I think so okay we as I explained the last couple of council meetings we talking here about the cash items which related to what we write for so in other words your development contributions and your profit on sale of property are not items that are actually rated for in the area of rates we have had a good year in fees and charges and also we 've had a good year as far as investment income is concerned on the te l phone as you can recall we 're doing about 6.8% on that particular fund when we do the budget each year we have to do a balanced budget so in other words the operating expenses have to be matched by the rates income what we have the opportunity this year because of head such a good year is to meet that eight hundred thousand by five hundred thousand out of the based on income from the tio fund and three hundred thousand out of the point of fees and charges that we have generated because of the level of activity of the business by meeting at out of this particular financial year in and working on a balanced budget going forward impact upon the rights as far as the rate payers are concerned that was one of their underlying criteria to try and achieve a relocation without an impact on rates so as far as the draft a new plan is concerned for next year we have a two point four percent rate increase that will not change as a result of this relocation okay thanks any questions of L give me just some clarification I own development contributions did you mission it 's going to come out badly funded by the head no I said when you look at our monkey financials it 's positively impacted by the increase in development contribution we budgeted for and also as far as the server properties I have moved those out because they are not rates related so what were actually meeting this liability out of is in theory rights related that because of the positive year with head did we know rating impact thank you it 's really to you we have someone else I think you must be able to give us a bit of exquisite so I will rule them could go to the Ford rebuild the links two or three years beyond the rights and at the stage until decisions are made and we 're not in a position to say what the rating impacts would be I think at a previous council meeting I did indicate that a complete rebuild without any sale of additional property he was about a two percent rate increase its total spread over three years just to me just ask that 's an average to be seen because of me from the general fund generate that would be out of the ten or eight years it 'll be an average because it 's not impacted by a targeted rate no but it 's an average of the Jeana like some whatever dominantly someone might endure increased as an average I 'm sorry whistling him justified that would be over a period of he is not just a one-year are correct this case so what we tried to do is have a zero impact on rate for the relocation and that 's because you 've had such a good year that would be able for me of mr. Mahina I 'm I 'm really pleased that we found a way to be able to achieve this because at the end of the day it wasn 't about cost it was about what we needed to do but I did you have a question regarding the treasury management policy and is an income from the Tal fund to fund operating costs we 're not contravening our policy no we 're not contravening our policy at all Oh Oh John I think he missed a minute however questions or queries I 'll put the recommendation here mr. chair and I yet I lost my resolution but I 'm feeling supportive on the phone looking somebody to move to so I will be supportive of this ready to move it I 'll get almost there you can 't see and move against the body seconded by Councillor heckling all those in favor please say aye against Eric rush I think they think so close eyes cancer-free minute thank you very much everyone I mean they you know that they this is a workshop it 's fabulous isn to stay if we have a workshop Pam coming up regarding the more banana CBD traffic investigation about a topical subject moment of the rebels area and monitor their minds gas affirmance and I ask this sample _"

Fox on the sorting is just waking the gods Li so I plan that we 're expecting I think that points you may have a very very valid and that it 's very nice to know that we 've got a good team ready in an emergency can I just enter that and as the emergency management unit along with things and be part of a conference called the what not with EEOC team and along with the stakeholders but fire and the police that it happened it was the sentence experience they 're really good relationships in there and if the other person elements of life I think everyone was very resilient and patient and communicates really well and I think it shows that we are resilient that there are a few sort of weak spots around when your event happening and we 've got stuff in other areas that perhaps we need to look at how we we are more resilient in our own patch and because it wasn 't a winner of it but a sudden I think it would have been different implications that um the silver lining was we didn 't have to worry that 's it was a reading worthy exercise here to go through so you 've got a great team in scoffs thank you watch you have a questions mr. Fox I will go through to water I 'll give this one yep thank you again I don 't know which teams there 's an increase of more than 20 kV an s2 to a large number subdivisions coming online it 's you know brick wood multiple stages here in your group which is radio station and chemical peels plus all of them smaller sites in this city knows anyone various and subsidies events now this is basically due to tectonic we understand the why to do any award project yet so therefore no measure about funding year has come through the ordinary tender and we 're ready to go out to the three sleep the

questions go okay transportation I 'll do them again so the game is increased predicted remove from these things the document is in its final review and we go at the end of this week and prepare to have a point project now before the local force project and just a note that will release here so when you also are trying to be completed so any queries on freight transportation resales Road sealed in the district link testing I gave them just give them as we 're really noting that we have had a couple of issues with some reseal the moment which you may be hearing about and so term and particular languages the problem exhale wind Mill us treat and we 're currently working with the contractor in the contractors it 's been seen the energy so with that we know where the time we expected to something on their time next week interesting last nine what thank you given community facilities Raisa Kevin I 'll talk to miss Hodges go first this is made up primarily of our venues libraries and pulse reserves the major revenue is generated in pools I mean with the bad weather we had quite an exceptional year through apples which are three interest so I was created a definitely increase in revenue and we 're well ahead they 're just some interest in front of you I guess the swing school has got a waiting list and 300-something the swim wall program that we 've been running conjunction with contacts is obviously and being some interest there but I do think porygon families went into town which you take advantage of that so it 's a bit of a challenge for us actually how we how we manage that because 300 quite a lot you know ProjectWise might just flipping over the page we 've got some performance measures there particularly some events we only to grab a couple of more I guess and we 'll hit on target but once obviously generated by the by the market out there rather than ask it was any questions on that particular projects around but to make is string or let 's Kevin respond to them yes it is not data it made his dream and put some content drawings for the tour book and they look weird but we also we 're do some concept drawing so that the way to do around by the streaming once we 've got all that together and we probably put that in a record there to counsel Cory next month huge years before Gordon nice technology context contribution to schools

sentence criticizing there 's no there was no problem specifically like I know we are clearly tourism ongoing issues curtailment or integration I notice he 's busy looking advanced that for the very high leg things can really be quite wet weather through the chair was a real concern through the telling that we worked with over for for this storm info that we talked about in fact the forecasting that the Regional Council that at that point indicated a five-meter increase on the lake level to the maximum that we had if we had that and when they were forecasted and the direction X forecasted we would have a significant increase erosion particularly the southern end of the lake around two hotels we had our staff out there I think up until that eleven o 'clock that night was a truck full of sandbags anything bagging some of those houses an anticipation so we did everything that we could an emergency scenes to to label it would have been initiated because it announced the question the Turing properties that were being created around another case of a road with no decorating because they were right on water or what they were the result of storm water so I Belen stormwater rather than like because of the hill arrange things thank you there 's also Avenue technically a store would take away their excess into those properties but the problem is until a legit license can send in

newspapers so that that major gaming players going to work his way through I guess the next one month and yes some really certain times I guess at the moment for this town fits on I guess the orange is there things again go out who other councils controlled weather I 've seen as measures of and of the economy all right thank you John any questions of John it 's called very very odd people okay as we can see the ICA is still at one point seven five inflation was announced two percent last week were sailing to see the increase potential increase in interest rates flowing out from America French relations are going to have some sort of impact Friday is the hundred days for President Trump and they need to pass legislation to fund the government that they don 't fund it by Friday then we can see some poor but vitality and depends on what sort of the pinch you 're looking at and as you can see our debt and barrings as very much in line with what mr. Ward respond to councilor cousins on earlier if we look at the second page the performance report there a year to date return of just over three percent as only our general funds we move over to pages the to point nine two percent as an annual return so that shows part of the ability to increasing you by being involved in equities which I know it 's not only to give a favorable with some people but we only have a very little mercy into the portfolio and equities but you can see how you can announ sensible investments lets you look returns from point oh six to the 6.92 team there is to the portfolio 's pretty much under control and you know nealandjune its assistance the Treasury position that counsel is pretty strong the moment they sell everything as soon as Menendez used the word that I don 't like you don 't advise me whatever lost on that is going here today I 'm in the current year the loss was much related to the currency difference between New Zealand dollar and the Great Britain pound as a result and breaks it where when we purchase those years exchange rate was forty six point one it 's now some of our 37 so that has an impact on the New Zealand dollar value of this years 't actually make money on it or lose money on it until yourself it 's the same with the disco shoes in them three years to live here they share the episode and several time is and we 've been getting dividends of them as well here 's what you supposed to reprove mental angle position above the council unity no scope on the Double A rating and we 're needs education especially at all thank you can just roam in on that point well what we do with this building that will not impact on the next report but it may will no one following the between we had our annual review with the committee from statement of cause we made the information related to the building available and based on any current financial position they didn 't have any concerns about our credit rating as a real result of expenditure required on a building so they will take into account in this report the Fed that we may spend on a building thank you okay thank you thank you to your team on then Ellen good all right have our suggested recommendation here that the that 's a nice information contained on needs for containing the council performance are important to the month of March and the movie phases that castle will in Sundance seconded by Councillor John 's always a family so I I it and thank you to the management team for all your input they are quite like the viewer and sexy and hearing the garrison all that you may have voice could _"

'm my understanding is that you are receives the latest version of this yesterday I thought we 'd like to do is go through that and identify any changes but also talk about the process following the adoption of this consultation document so the consultation with the GAM assistant mayor and run until the 26th of May we 're hearing receipt down these events to the lack of Joan in deliberations on the 15th of June and the obviously will be someone a little incremental changes they will follow this mentioned that we 'd also came to get your feedback now and shins a little concern of the document of many other changes that you 'd like to propose okay thank you you want to go through each page my page these are all on and I see okay so cover that 's the building then you 'll end up at the end okay okay page number up to you cousins guys suggest on page three that we typically hardware codification the about nine rifle range Road because you don 't_''_106.799 I think maybe they should we made it noted at the second building do you think the force data stream to packing and not the buildings in question are separating out the key brain the back building is not include and that 's because the fundamental assume it 's all going the back brilliant at nine refrigerators not treasonous here is it no I 'm doing it for clarity is a sweet one so I 'm just on next as email on Friday and it 's referred to as the make Terrence site all the way through the document because the public won 't differentiate between 72 late Terrance into mine rifle range Road given that out and physical injuries and Exley 's in ventilators I 'm concerned that if we were to start entering in nine month or mange right now that there may be some confusion like tera sites has done for people known as nine local range riders certainly included and the value of the doctor that being termed as a link terrorist site all right so anymore on page three we 're putting on HTML pages for clarification regarding the total building and the reason we 're doing [Music] battle depends we went about option obviously and suspect the decision was just too informal so entry was richer and the thought process was that effort was it was a complete rebuild then naturally going to attract oil for the others in there suitable disaster recovery and if it was the refurbishment the advice the ATK view was that we could make part of the building oil for so therefore we wouldn 't need the ability operating center which is too small on that and the old prefab but the rest of the building that would be either unachievable or too expensive to make the whole building oil Romans 3 you I didn 't expressly a meeting this morning my concerns about the speed this has taken place and if we just went to the one point to because there 's some breathing space of a couple of years that may not be satisfactory you 've a moment to the long-term plan and I 'm just really we run a passage in here it would take place and promote employment over clearing or and my conversation with local governing zeal so if counsel was of a mind that you couldn 't that you win doesn 't want to make this decision now or that you wanted to some months down the track then like any decision at any time you had to a long-term plan amendment that would require for water central their documents I wouldn 't come with extra costs I would probably say that if you were doing there you and simply wait until you 're doing a long-term plan needs to you anyway you 're probably wait until their time the issue then is that you have relocated the staff out of the building for a considerably longer period of time between now and when you get it out so why are we not going to in this long-term plan comes taste similarly intent to mean their own term claiming the annual plan to mend long term plan certainly made in the the annual plan thank you for that but at this stage Marinette had their conversation to state you already put out this movie anytime we can immediately now let 's roll where is that again why aren 't we doing it Ariel so I decided on a promotion clarification this only seed in circumstances that require an amendment and that 's part of this process that we 're going through at the moment in even if we were to do it slightly later a national movement crazies that 's why we haven 't talked to many proteases with you to this point is religion listen to portability ideas discussions with the right universe as well as should be we should be that were the risk alleles business etc and then Tania meaning happen on this point over for so look at the big picture stuff yeah we talked about division again on and showing arraignments community about with all the amenities and facilities that you have the purpose so I 'm just if I told you so I understand the implications and understand the arguments around other people different views but was here or somewhere else we must need to comes the big big stuff in just yeah destroyed taking a solution right back to the document so ok so we go through the document is anyone any counselors want to raise any any particular points on the document that they want change or altered or amended so my cousins I 'm Paige a father must be respond to an option for I still believes that needs the universal financial strategies implications but no reason teach them they 're about using the funds must sell the site to build and all see any cattle on this one don 't understand why box under the finalists reading applications in social media it 's a good point so we have is important first point there so of the Lake Terrace site and funds used towards things usually okay this one is Kim the New River sit down and we go with central government were attempting to be some years ago by making a smooch with other councils for the implications long term for buildings daily others in worship unnecessarily nothing on the cards condemned the whited upper west coast and doing some investigation work Auckland so there 's certainly nothing and made the short medium term and I would say even if we we were unlucky enough to the amalgamated with somebody else in the future you would still need an administration presence and building and in total the size of which who knows what that event would be I guess this is showing confidence to your community that we do and in dust or whatever presence and TOEFL thank you cancer cousins you on page aspect we discussed equality Ron basically a bit cots my lease at the pre-show Pragathi annual is commendable million dollars their rights prevalent we don 't get for a first year under control so my vision I chose not appear Adam million dollars children thank you now the same place same I really like the way you 've hit it up these are so you had you were saying like way you win it basically solely so you got there getting the list and same-sex okay sorry just regarding the one until I have mentioned for the more to reach to somebody whose ideas of other sites I mean I know it said you have any other comments that I 'd like to be a little more open so it invites ideas because I 've had lots of people also mentioned air inside so it 'd be nice to see it say something husband wrong so I read one part of me if it 's if it can be done and and what we 've proposed interfere another side you what happens the location and what you know what do you have what source you have all something just to give them a need so we like to boxes ELISA two linear molecules having we did discuss that and we were looking at how lengthy and listener could be would you be happy if we amended that choice do you have any other comments or a preferred site that in the coming position it would be fine I think yeah so there would be number three so they 'll be number three okay Michael all right I think that just having somebody who cook another thing that is we 've got a door to the car park nothing in the Donovan that Kings so it what people people to know that we look into Campagna at the same time below or another building one seven years ago intermittent bowling alley with a park about it lemming of it was a part of the options and filters through this year and if you were looking at one of the other options there 's currently carbide the most juice into at that time would be and we spoke to at the workshops didn 't need to replace their cup argument you 're going on and that you probably want to enter there Paul smuggled customers having performance by accumulate for the town centers growth n-woo zone because of the Israel cars that you 'd be putting them from canceled activities so so there would be one of those decisions that you would take if you were on an alternative site we simply don 't know at this point until you know we preferred sizes what they criminalize and what the mix of uses and activities on those sites could when those things that you would decide in deliberations if it wasn 't the site there is a preference things we add and what would the mix of users be on their site keen to see Messiah this is just the start of what will be a rather long journey that we won 't be working with our community on thank you okay correctly then I 'm sure we 'll hear from the community quite loud and clear I 'll have a subject in which is right evil so any other comments Thank You widget into questions mainly so we talked about our mailing the period of consultation are we planning holding any public meetings or information sessions and what we 've got planned to date as these we 've got about a thousand copy disease being printed that will be available in our council facilities from next week we also have a couple of pages going in the toko times when I sent out the email last week ask for feedback on consultation amines in nobody enter is there so I 'm just wondering whether you get some indication events and if so where would you like them to be okay um what 's what 's worked in the past one isn 't worked a lot of people did I think the subject is quite topical so I 'm sure that we have some consultation down we are like an election knows about some ups and downs I think yeah because I think you will give the people is everything what was signaling with an appetite to have those discussion and what I know when we did the LTP when you know you set up a series of meetings and different parts of the community and we went to those meetings I think that 's probably a good auction to account for information light source of it yeah well welcome with some options and deceive them out for you thank you thank you okay very good oh well thank you very much for the doctrines in here at hand and I 'm sure you 'll blank-faced changes

CEO to get of Queen would you have to leave this off well i 'm thinking you wish up and industry what girls the council off the team years probably more about asking other answer any questions that you may have but is your will have been through two workshops now with you around the issues associated with this building mainly around the health and safety issues that have been identified student being significant its fiscal issues some earthquake issues and add that other health and safety issues mainly around potential fire risk and some leaks etc and this building and so we 've previously presented to you some options is as we see it in it out and Xperia drivers if you 've seen us and provided them divided in presented tease those options were from a short small scale first up for the health and safety reasons right through to a demolish this current building then rebuild the building either here or somewhere else and the paper that you 've got in front of you goes through those options that frozen cost and the cost in the elements to that and the recommendation that I 've provided to you there is that that you confirm that your food option to address the health and safety issues the at this current site is the site for the for the new berlin and i would note that the discussion through the workshop was for potential other sites they mean particularly the discussion that councillors head was around the Great Lakes inca site I haven 't_''_199.52 recommended that in my in my recommendation and because it is an hour if kenosha news officers but we have obviously talked through there in the paper so if councils were of a mind that they wish to go down that road that would be up to you to the ED those that is a recommendation but it 's certainly not our recommendation air staff that you do that in the other the other if mendations there are procedural one is in terms of the cost of relocating the staff which is going to have to happen regardless of the option that you take and we are doing that and planning that so that we will be out of here at pfizer in july this year so that 's happening regardless of me of the options and then the that resolution is about funding 's for there to be included in the consultation document from annual plan and as fury tight timeframes for that obviously we need to get the annual plan adopted by the end of the financial year and it 's the next financial year and the timeframes that we 've got for their as submissions for a month in into hearing of submissions by yourselves early in June and in deliberations of the second week of people so really they take the risk the item is read industry to dance or any questions that anybody may have I can 't_''_284.79 think ever did you or team one add anything to make Karen and gas okay all right lovely all right questions of the CEO just a buddy just a crease in regards of regards of why we came to be in this Russian the hourly information will be recent very soon the party was from clear safe they given the investigation august of last year the better one was 2012 and yet now suddenly right now we 're having to make quite a big decision why wasn 't this looked at the key driver here for the vehicle report and we just were mount about the earthquake risk of the truth sometime and the only reason that we 've got a period of time that we can deal with that the only reason we did we 're suggesting that you deal with it now is that that you have to deal with SB estas risks in any event and the asbestos risk which identified when we when we enter paint the building in the risks or the rush now I guess is that the information that we 've got which were provided to you shows that there there s business not to set asbestos as present as that it 's fri ball and that it 's starting to deteriorate so that becomes a significant health and safety risk for staff publicly in the environment and it 's that the reason for the risk so regardless of your decision in terms of what that the ultimate form of the building is whether it 's a full rebuild a partial rebuild the site or on other sites we can 't expose our staff have our staff out of here today right o bones about that from a practical perspective obviously we need to be finding alternative location given the fitted out technology etc and we need to continue business so um so hints there to lie to take that I 've given you just sort of in that that went on the one to do with asbestos there were 37 sites looked out of which 24 were clear so when we look at if we 're going to say partially rebuild as that cost infected and the partial rebuild would be moving the basis of this front section all these are creating is bestest and they would just deal with Alice ideas there we will upgrade the original so customer service severe would also be upgraded and that 's possible so that 's been affected in to a pass to rebuild at 8.5 million thank you you have a Christmas can 't cash flow cousins thank you Karen w teen I suppose why I even considered this relates back to tutoring actually and I 've asses for about this is Special Counsel body well aware of the realities and a danger of exposing people with our buildings and 20 year olds and yours they have their specimen they have rusted out roofs they 're leaking through sockets and light settings is grass growing out of the rules but this no sense of agency to get our stuff out of here me can we talk about this these things like create a working environment and designing an inclusive and flexible council chamber with appropriate technology we 've been told we have to wait three years for hours and they 're going to brush through toples and it does consume me that yeah what for my town we 're going to we 've been overlooked and although I understand the severity of it all it 's it 's a little bit unfair sir is the the health of second derivative of to donate offices is and has been continually look at and and the very same situation would apply down there despite the fact that we 've only got two or three staff via health and safety is just as important as the the 150 be dealing with it in exactly the same way other risks haven 't_''_535.52 been identified to be the same as here and so that is because in the building but not not at the same state as the asbestos on this building so the risk of significantly reduced a lot of buildings and then I 'm saying most buildings of this this age FSB stops and then in itself is not a problem you know most residential garages in town would have SB stuff better than ur self isn 't a problem the problem is only when it 's when it 's friable which this is becomes unstable which this as becoming unstable because of the fact that at some that 's passed at the building 's partners data in terms of pain and maintenance so that 's created the issue I understand that Thank You Kara throat what considers that we 're talking about health and safety and the broad spectrum of things and our people internally are exposed to safety issues every day that I saw has not been touched for 30 years and you can stand in the light sockets and the pools of water on the floor we 're talking about one with Alexis better safety issue that is a safety issue I 'm asking one is to standards about sense of urgency okay the roads get does consuming I think there is so we are in getting a continually working on to outsiders moved up or continue working on that and I keeping it to a standard that is it is appropriate and is meeting those health and safety requirements there as you 're aware there is a a project beer now for for a little bit more work via with with the effectively so that will solve that issue it 's a patch-up job again for us and as I 'm totally off topic though it 's all relevant to the safety issues they were talking about and I me now my only my only my primary requirement is to ensure that the staff and these buildings are safe and uncomfortable that the staff and to Tonya buildings are safe that 's not ideal absolutely not agree completely with you but it is but about stuff mobility network over you have a question sir custer park and not so much a christian but like a totally understand what counselor chasms as saying and i think that it shows that we 're going to leave amazing opportunities in our district to sort of get things right in the future place and I see this I 'm for a completely booked I think this effect that we 're sitting in a sort of a house with additional add-ons after Elms is not appropriate it needs to be more of a corporate structure and having a median see management as a standing committee of captain and I think it 's important that we do go to the aisle so and so 's is quite strengthening those and answers that we need to stop looking at this is you 've got the plush office on the lakefront we need to mop hit having a statistic Civic Center where people feel welcome and engaged and to come in and be more involved for council and so I just think that they vanish there 's only so many ways that now his illness it needs to go thank you against back and Neil I just can guarantee clarify the oath of them rebuild was confirmed and xenyx in all parties that would come into the to the building of the only negotiation 0 or as any one chosen chilaka I 'm taking the Regional Council to have those sorts of places so yeah it 's really to confirm one hundred percent on closely until you 've made a decision we can 't do that but but initial discussion show that there is interest for what other like-minded council council activities to be here which obviously it via saving in terms of that in terms of where we 're currently we might be paying council might be paying rent or to private providers or as you say what 's an original council are currently looking for alternative locations so depending on on our will one others I as we go through the process that could be designed them so that it 's done I used as a park use the word select the exam that that 's more of its to a community building not so much a council building as such yet the way that I feel is that is a you know II rear of the building which is public you know which is public meeting spaces chamber in there around the chamber that go with it is the customer service experience that you 're able to provide and then there 's the administration staff wishes go on behind the seat so there 's a public space is probably the more important part of the base plate okay thank you you have a questions okay so what do you think Oh basically the support council parks and obviously auguste rodin thought you know this we also go back the future in it okay baby and was the sort of the great lakes in response wasn 't really simple purpose or never one elephant butt the disposable transpose will delicately with before thinking a corrective and council just employ the media the quality of the experience build the staff you will employ staff only to do in public no sir I price to do I suit really support by us the society okay thank you cancel answer you ever I money that 's a true much Jason thank you sorry we will slightly I mean the minutes so jealous right thank you i guess for me just a comment and also just to request when we go through consultation face and i made a request when we went through the workshops and they i wanted to really look at a couple of options I understand and I think you 'll get complete support in this room that we need to do some thinking we need to do something with a sense of the agency but in terms of the options with a rule we stay here we moved somewhere else I really wanted to have that discussion with the community so that we could get a sense of us for a feel for what how people see this bill succeed this building and the purpose of it and so for Mary I 'm feeling that some of the balancing is the advantage disadvantages for the different sites feel slightly I have to be frank quite biased in my view like for staying here you hadn 't trusted any one of the exact disadvantages of staying here if we lose the opportunity to so rough land and then offset those costs so I 'm just asking as we go through this discussion that we developed up some of these things a little bit more Heather discussion and in the consultation I just like to really understand from the staff this permit for that Harry and Tim to have that discussion because I 'm here in this room access Council of talking about our inspiration to this so this building but I would really like to understand what the communities are as well so that we see there and understand that in this process that some of that the so it 's quite long know this one they so totally acknowledge and i think i did at the start and then your workshop you talked about other sites and i 've only brought back to you the site and that 's been based on on our professional engineers officers in terms of when we did look through those other sites and the we have of the community feedback of those other sites and particularly the site down at the great lake center so as officers we can only recommend to you what our professional opinion is it 's up to you now that if you wish to add other sites in the next that 's totally an adjust and in an appropriate thing for you to do that 's the majority and feel that way but it certainly isn 't our recommendation to do that we do believe that this is that be site for the office for a note for a number of reasons and they 're articulated beer and we spoke in the workshop about the the value of the sighting in the ability to sell but also the reduced value because of the christopher very presence of this building so all those things combined the factor of a hundred public sitting for about dollars of how much we would get from the site in case you do want to go down that line but given the dollars that we feel in that the experts that have been advising us the site we don 't believe that it 's a responsible thing to do to sell the site and move somewhere else for the during that you get tense you 've got the recommendation that you do this consultation photo for ebook to Lisa not at all through the consultation document and what they would look like I was catch the cash register now say something yes mr. chair just without backing onto that I instantly think Aris but you know even the financial strategies of option five when you 've ever mentioned about a significant dollar value of a man in at work a scenario with three or four million dollars it 's talking about a 15 million dollar rebuilt desk like that first quarter the funds we pay for next commit a significant portion of what is our financial strategy is should have been included there is an advantage I suppose also i 'm really concerned if we don 't go out and openly consult will end up with a fiasco as we did with hemlock and the canopies and to don 't you just recently we didn process has to be open and we have to gauge public interest 10 years on it has to happen yes my view I mean and for the support comment to affordability is something that we need to factor them I mean my concern is a cost to the community moving forward over the years ahead we are talking about rate increases to cover this we are facing market conditions where interest rates are going to rise significantly in the next few years so I think we just need to balance all those factors out when we make these decisions as well so from that point sorry through to you too Alan so we 're talking about this will be a two percent rate rise if we do is proceed to do a fifty-million-dollar rebuild it on every right parrot asteroid correct and so on top of worthy our existing protect inquiry is going to be in the 2017-18 year it 's a typical one and that some of those costs will be spread over the next to its rules so as you see qunut of effect will be to the year we did have a financial strategy which we will be reviewing as per the LTP and that is the local government facial index plus one percent so that 's what we 're trying to live with that at the moment and a new sex changed that 's what we have to live with them people where would you suggest in maybe we look at three to four percent increases over no really about about also how you how you plan the rest of your program to make it until place which tool sets or the new for indigenous we 're gonna have to cut elsewhere to do this and no not cut but is the phasing in the in the way that you undertake your business to be able to do this and the savings that you get from doing us through operational savings so I guess just also find on from that one of the things in terms of costs is that it is what we 've got here what we provided to you is there circa 15 15 million dollars for the total rebuild here and the your other preferential site we found it really hard as officers to come up with any idea of what the cost of that would be and we knew there would be a whole lot more expensive than 15 million and we knew that would be a whole lot more to the extent effective half a gain if not more because you are adding having to add to the Great Lakes center because you just have uncertainties you 're not dealing with a a fish site and a new building you 're dealing that game with like what you would be with another build here of adding things on so this where we struggled and without spending a whole lot of time and money getting architects and quantitative engineers we got to the point where we just couldn 't articulate to you to be able to really provide what those costs would be on those other sites if it was on another greenfield sites had come to us in town in a gang you attempt to replicate the car parks and so you 'll be a cost of doing it but 't have the architects or the quantity surveyors flange to know how much that would be other than to be able to say there would be more than what you 'll be paying here and so given that we really took the view that just building a council building or Civic Goreans been on the site for 50 of the years and it served the community very well in that time so we really talked to view that the founding fathers of the town probably got it about right and so given that we knew what the dollars worth this is why the recommendation is that we come back here through the chili I 'm confused because you 're saying about be down as a friendly the words going to cost to change down there but we 're not even factoring wasn 't it cost to Christ deconstruct these buildings on it and any of us either you know these expenses there 's like we 've seen so expect in choosing what we want to deal with here and he is then we see bent down to go through the much it 's going to cost us a film with those buildings and the indicator but as it set to the same here about some inland and celery and how we could save money on deconstructing this building it we just sold it lock stock and barrel there should fall kind of discussion shouldn 't that through the cheer can I just say that there are a lot of unknowns for Xavier if you reduce the footprint of this building then land behind the building is available for sale we 've got no idea what that would be will value so we 're talking about there 's a bigger picture thing here yeah and then I 'm no fool about the stand here read newspapers it 's just quite its lack of information yeah in the world we 've given you is as much information as we can do at this point to be able to make the high-level decision and I believe enough information for you to make the recommendations that were decision but enhancing the recommendations otherwise I want to put them to you we know how much know how much the how much impact having this building on here we 'll have the free if we put the market the building a site for sale what 's going on frankly the if we were to sell the site and move it 's probably going to be better for us to deconstruct the building and sell the site reservation piece of land been to sell the site and building is one excu he 's doing because it 's fluid just put the discussion of then I want to get on to the earthquakes sector and I made the comment certainly delivered with scenario that we 're going to make a decision on you 've already started doing at our annual plane decision-making we 're at the moment we 've got what Ellen what would we be looking at that rate increases for for the Union plan a 2.4 percentage every the 2.4 mb we 're never saying to the people there 's going to be another to be seen on top of their know so do we need to get really clear that this isn 't assigned to saying is that is the recommendations it 's only talking about the philosophical elements what 's the cost of the move in and the annual plan the costs for if you make this decision and the decision is to rebuild totally on the side most of the costs of that the decision wouldn 't fall until fruits you of your ltp and in fact even unto the next one because you 're talking about a three-year design construction phase so the cost will be phased from this year where you 've got a surplus right through for the new communities but eventually that cost is going to be borne by the rate per cumulative Lee it 'll get to latex around about a two percent rates increase because yes absolutely the right path is easily nobody else will so it 's um the loan funded in anything they took you seen an impact on rights full of the truly was the ones doing the earthquakes in the beta report and the xperia will tell us the main problems this particular piece of the building they were sitting in an asset it 's this is the area of the major concerns of the magic so there was this area here was redeveloped we 're looking into eight million which was the only so let 's recollection too yeah what we put in yep okay and Thank You counselors and did you want to be so did you okay of course here okay thanks cereal [Music] okay thank you all right you ever questions or so it 's okay is a suggested recommendation there can I course my music on page we 've got a second i guess the back singer by Councillor rincon as anyone else want to talk and support a large movement I mean thank you and i 'm not sure the exact reading would be but I 'm very keen to look at option two which is to upgrade this particularly at the building today if great standard in the refuge of the downstairs area and even just chamber so I 'd me that I mean it [Music] okay so we 'll just load it right on the table of the lung cancer body and we have a taxing to buy counselor Rankin and should i ask who is in favor of that please raise your hands okay recommendation this past thank you very much nothing against you would you didn 't ask you with anyone against you just it yep okay there 's anyone against okay would you like that recruited yeah I city councillors I 'm okay really so those against against the body council customs yeah I think we should be putting it out to the communities thank you very much ask ask ariel miley he told in this consultation that 's going to take place what OMG consultation on we 're going to go to the people and say we have decided to completely rebuild we 're not going to say we 've got a couple sites to look at you want a partial rebuild it 's fairly complete lips what is the consultation actually gonna mean either option or see something else what you might like a little bit thank you okay thank you kisses and item number for complete your business is it well I catchment okay thank you thank you babies media closed [Music] _"

    "text": "[Music] right now to item 5.5 can lock Esplanade reserve vehicle access we have met Carol noon counter sir I 'd like to take my record is being read under and not so great deal more other then probably inappropriate time in the process for you to start to think about what your philosophical views are or what your philosophical position is around vehicle access onto the reserves and that will no doubt lead you on to some debate as officers we 're quite happy to implement any changes that you proposed this is the point we really need to give [Music] [Music] [Music] employment thank you I thank you dari then she runs a second this recommendation thank you do you have any further comments or queries on that resolution Jim don 't you think I find this is a faster I 've ever seen a motion book before a council before any discussion on the agenda paper has taken place but be that as it may the resolution that was passed that the last me he made the comment that the staff would had plans dreams of the we do have the claim of you car parking etc etc with the plans at the inlet reasons growth was booked before us but we don 't have anything to the council and their garden what that reserve could look like with no vehicles from why would that be it 's like an because basically because they would be as simple as putting a gate up and stop in the vehicles going through so there 's there 's not much of a plan to be able to show other than status quo well I have a different point of view concept of trees tables blah blah blah would give you a feeling of no vehicles because one of the concerns that I have and my stance I don 't believe has changed you can write committees and submissions to this council they talk about the reserve been open for approximately 20 vehicles there I know that in the height of summer and like seem to be created there 's a consumable more than 20 vehicles on that wizard at any one time so think of Lee who operates the gate why are we talking about okay so I 'm not sure no no political gate the Ventura 's not for me to defend or just get to discuss they both can location groups playing favorably or not but he 's what they 've claimed as doors provide physical constraints and so the the amount of cars vehicles that go on to that plan by my reading of that plan would be constrained by the ricotta 's so a car drove in in all those 20 car parts if that 's what it is was full then that car would simply have to drive out they would have nowhere to park given that it 's constrained rather than being able to park on the grass as you currently do and that 's my point 20 cars or no cars 20 cars thank you madam chair the resolution that Barry 's put food and also talks to next comment I think we need a lot of information in front of us and the council offices are asking us to give them some direction and from there the detail will follow out of need to make a philosophical decision about whether the reserve is open or not to vehicles which is what barriers done and then once we voted on that the detail can come out from me which is why we 're trying to get this resolution as we ask now no I 'm cheer yes can I just clarify on the item five plus five attachment 10 which page is it sorry 72 am I right in understanding that the cars are not actually when the reserve and met in that drawing that the anti world is that the proposed Road Ronon road in an impact on the side of that road but that road is on a reserve but if you looked at the situation that we 've got a farwalker it would be exactly the same as what I carriageway right an honor reserved right what the cars can do in that plan as my reading of it is to drive onto the car okay thank you it [Music] right and councilor John it 's really cheap just councillors and Josie was a rather philosophical it supposed to make does corroborate the world for the consultation process we went through and inconsistent will be our in Crete and I think we 're getting what it would detail the stage it 's going to make a decision with us opening I think the question that was asked there was good to be understanding exactly what it meant whether it was on the grass or on the road was particularly so particular plan but possibly to take some of the basic elements out of the key lock the group 's plan just to be able to be developed so can be used by all age groups and just to take those basic elements making sure I 'm sure will protect the historic Troy 's facility for car parking and basically that would be my suggestion is keep it natural that part 1 part 2 of that resolution I do we want to get into detailed design yes NFS sign it and thank you and Madame tier how however actual resolution is written doesn 't satisfy me at all i just find it 's a matter of it you know but it too long I 'm unhappy to reach a compromise and XE um the key key for a design point of the working group minus all the goodies because I believe in what councilor Kalina say about the natural immunity and new things that I do concur with counsel rincon they 're somewhat exhibited were to accept this and draft design those calves do look like they are on a more defined Road area and when they are allowed to protect and the reserve so if this was this has been moved and seconded I 'm not going to bug for it that I would be willing to look at a more workable resolution it gives a bit more finality to the situation than singing of a group to with that can we alter the resolution any queries you can like yeah yeah that 's what I just say this is really important to get this right I had already agreed and my kids that I was going to compromise and vote for this affects what we were voting on if that 's not what we 're betting on just go is getting ridiculous a business or a boy is really think about resolutions is to for noise or design so we can go back to Castle yeah I understand what and I 'm Christina saying it 's not as specific as working with excellent great amenity tourism is a suggestion to move forward I think you all saying the same thing but ways yeah money whether or not I 'm the move in the city of their might Mike Beavis thinking about the resolution is it currently stands but adding some more points about what you 're trying to achieve into the second part so so we 're it talks about keeping a natural that you could say so it includes the excess way than copper formation the no papperman cracks of planting whatever those of us you go registration nicely political eating that I won 't listen listen yep sure is quiet management I wanted to really keep the system to ensure within my initial [Music] dress resolution with the protection of [Music] all kind of material to comply with the reserves management plan 2007 now that 's what get into details and cut out the essence of what I was trying to achieve yep that 's what I understand and if the u.s. councillors I think would like more details so they know what they 're voting on the no time in particular mr. dreams that 's a given the question therefore of the through that year of the of the move and a cylinder as are you happy for those to the motion to be amended that way well I 'm suggesting I 'm suggesting i would add those in if my fellow councils are more comfortable with that included um accountable as long as it has a specifically say that it 's in line with the current action groups plan proposal can we add that to it because i think that 's what either ones come on open soon an action plan the plan was presented I think this was part of a talk soon I think I think important singers but yes counselors want to be sure that people are driving on the road okay within yeah just read them out so if it 's amazing but he 's happy with it I mean tight that is the new motion okay i 'm sitting there is no action type of protection and applause for meters around to start cream the expansion of the driveway McCoy to try and set aside for a parked car parking and that all the elements and the two would comply to the reserve management I 'm 2007 because I have real concerns that if it doesn 't comply to the management plan we made if going back to that issue because it don 't comply understood okay so do we want to read they have to help out onto the reservation possible resolution yep it 's we write a clarify one element and is the last part of that draft resolution talking about materials and elements complying with the management plan memory no no it doesn 't it mrs. be rightly the management plan currently talks about not using sealed surfaces so we 'd be going back towards gravel I think you 're right now so I think that 's the intention i understand i don 't what I 'm is actually quite specific and says later won 't use those people in materials that it will be Kobe blocks etc so we shouldn 't be soon but over on to Kobe blogs or our materials or materials complete poem on materials sale was not injured on jobs so would the expectation of counsel be that we would remove the seal well that 's already there almost got to convert to cancel with the final time I guess all I 'm signaling as your resolution at the moment was pushing us towards a situation where we 'll be removing that seal which will clearly come at a corner take it out take the last put out energy to make up but mr. Carroll is saying policy states that go big blocks or similar blocks or somewhere yeah similar could be materials that allow water to go through that 's what I do I 'm sure has it written down can we really really sad how could you please read part 1 impact yeah for clarity okay don 't you that you will receive an email and we just stay right before the reservation comes forth before us again do they speak before the recession see i want to point out the information supplied in a letter from the chemo resident he thought this little it was also in to us in the mirror and ironic windows arena because it seems to me a little bit contrary to what the wishes are of the working group from canoga they say here proposal divided the roadway and put blogs and railing along the sides limiting parking would destroy the ascetic in natural beauty of the reserves will also not be pretty cool they ought they also raised the issue of the wrong body poplar trees in the use by date has come basically suggesting that they should be removed now it 's the only thing I see unreal or submissions the contradictory points of view from the great variety of the cannot community I don 't know what we gonna be achieved by the resolution with dealing with at the moment well the resolution has been put and it 's been moved and seconded so can we leave we resolution that in an ear protection area for the formations around the historic trees extinction of the driveway and sitting beside an area for car parking in keeping the natural immunities author reserved in my understanding is that the last part of their compliance management plane is no longer today the earth true great so my main event would be released sadly you conceded would anyone else like to speak for or against the motion just to make the comment the costumes garlic and we 've got constant at the moment we invented delay it for more costumes to come back for council approval or not so through you madam chair record in your draft budgets at the moment as a hundred thousand dollars for next year for the reserve so we would as we do for any project we wouldn 't give it to design a project up to fit within the budget that we 've given us thank you any further comments okay before you put the tape just to the right Adam shared I just like to highlight the reason why I think that part 1 as we will know similar developments on way from reserves I 'm are though admittedly a bigger reasons but that was not closed off at the world we allowed vehicle access setting aside certain areas for parking except on the same is for a record and also making away from only some sometime around all this past year cancel a unanimous decision of which this one people sitting around this table to develop the area from the creek station through to the dock land connecting bag my bag we made a different decision to allow cars to go on that reserve and constructed a driveway right way down to give people access as well as extending the great like walkway my decisions are all consistent unless our decisions was all consistent with the relevant one has been planned to do with those various obstacles and why I live part 11 an injured ankle assistant decision-making throwing our council Thank You Barry okay so we 've got a movie for the motion and a second the motion any further queries all those in favor i against i recorded please thank you the motion is passed add something because a man kind of see me from showing up today and he represented a different group and he had a suggestion that didn 't fit with our previous discussion but I think we should have it on me on the table and I had mentioned it together he believed that coming up with its record development discipline the master plan and are doing that we haven 't even talked about see the fact that we 've got one of the best golf courses I don 't know if you 've hid in the world or in the country and we 've got a world-class marina with loads of kids dying into taco every day to school you know we need to plan for school to sigma field for kids to thomas five these five programs but now in school and he was talking about making it into a fishing village like Montreal camera another opinion albania but it 's perfectly but that kind of thing and I think we need to now look at hemlock and see what it could look like in the future in planet million chea and in Council rank and dead rose it with me earlier in we looking at Chancellor hatchlings he 's probably a line around the table when we did it but the last time that there was a big controversial issue and Ken lock was around redid our district plan review and and we tried to rezone the Atlanta consistent worth topol and it 's a result of that we ended up having this 10 lock community structure plane which was the community and the community association were very strong and giving us to their point so they play install stories lists and install sorts on the table and so my suggestion is it maybe if we circulate that to the members that might not be aware of that have a look at it and it can always be reviewed at some point in the future along with your work program if it 's seen that that 's out of date or needs more work thank you okay so you 're happy with that he 's sorry Thank You Christine _"

finds opportunity craft thank you very clear about the mission without having to tell paper so unison a winder company consume the area of thought by tau 0 and gross grill so 110,000 customers throughout this region we have lines tables and your local area looked at her presence and start from here we have 24 people in our fo a lot of repeat performance in building up lining some holes and substations restoring power for communities and times of need we 've also caught a lot of new technology to this region since we binder so we 've owned the network 2003 you purchase the smithwick and referee at that time and we bought some fast technologies and smarts lot of capital and additional we spent 48 million dollars in a short period of time bringing that technology but also enhancing cover the business community on this area just talking about some of those quite quickly as we will remember the August snowstorm granite oh gee we saw over a hundred people here within full paragraph four week period report of a crowing from around result to do that so we have a very big presence here also working partnerships look for a few high school for the development of their brain power but then make sure that they can do their businesses their revive so we do have a big presence in a big association with this region but one thing we would like to talk to you about today is electric vehicle charging and how while we have to Floyd smart charges and rotor up and walks by and by 9pm taupo and for our neighboring lines company and central Hawke 's Bay which we have a management services contract for we have deployed or really charges there and the app that you can see in that we have proposed to install one downtown taupo to bring people into this region so i 'm going to hand over the station 's another night we 'll just imported a little bit about a couple questions thank you and Lena 's described the gap on the methods telephone we 've been doing a lot of work over the last month 's looking around town to find a suitable location for a fast charger this is an exercise compromised essentially because it 's a number of factors that need to come up here that make this work the first and foremost we are people wanting to stop with is a convenient place where people stopped because it takes about 20 to 30 minutes to recharge an electric vehicle using a fast charger it needs to be a place of convenience near amenities near facilities also with also with some suitable place that safe that has space for the electric vehicle to pull into a suitable car parking space practicalities like where exactly the connection point us on the cards in different places on different models and also we have those heavy electrical supply capability so it uses quite a lot of electrical network capacity so the site was we 've selected is just a block across from here the other side of the fire station alongside the existing car parks beside the station we 're proposing to build new parks to provide for the electric vehicle charging spaces and place them in a as shown on a smoke architecture we 've considered other details for flip to the next slide working with some counsel information about existing services that are in the area you might ought to see on the on the graphic here that there 's a blowie being through the middle it 's an existing high-pressure water main so we have to keep the equipment away from there so we 've configured the sites so they keep clear of that water main exclusion zone but fit within the available space between the driveway to the side on the at the back of the fire station property and the existing car parks we 've we 're proposing to install one initial fast charger which would serve as two packs partnership with others who we work with to as we do with other electrical connections facilitate more of those to come to town another factor in our selection is a desire to hear this in the downtown area and attract visitors to tell go into the central area for their purpose have been close to amenities but also to bring that business into town so this is the site as a sense of considering many around town and working with council staff to identify what we believe is the best location that that suits all of those purposes and there is the site we 're proposing and requesting an endorsement of that 's good ellen 's from flex that take to charge a car with your charges 30 minutes 20 min sania it does depend on the battery size but it 's typically from us and leaf for example which is a very calm it 's the most common model in the country 20 to 30 minutes that 's from near flat to pretty much fault you know the person charging would have to remain with that vehicle until it off downtown now they could get some woods safe it 's self managing in terms of of leaving at the SAS they can in effect there are notification systems in the back office system that supports it to see in a notification to the person see the Matthias and say it 's full now Kambei can pick it up or move it on so someone else can use the pack so it 's what I was really pushing here right is this quite a lot of is etiquette developing around our collection access used here if you are trying to leave them self self-managed ethical the last wafer to heathers is an indication of the types of vehicles and this is a selection of all the models that are on New Zealand roads already and the colored dots indicate which type of charging system which switch standard they used as so there is a max in the charger we 're proposing to put in place covers the ones with everything but the the red dot all the others would be covered by the technology that we are proposing to deploy its conclusion of our slides okay thank you letter Nigel there 's a little further comments make 20 50 50 and 51 day and were called mountainous at baking november there was an expression of interest for any charges and location and mcdonalds karapatan selected and we selected one vendor forever and subsequently declined by fo and jameson have indicated a boyfriend for this corner site Thank You Dana any further queries um thank you madam chair just a question from may I guess to Dennis how well utilized are those current car parks and chi minh illustrate where they 're relatively rare is very council staff but when I saw proposed almost for construction of an additional six packs okay thank you excellent answer any further questions nothing further so we have two recommendations here obviously you can see them in front of you the council approves uniforms proposal to establish an EV charging station a meno a street adjacent to the fire station or number two dat council revokes resolution to DC 2016

    "text": "I think even capsules will be a performance report you wish to comment OMG so we 're working through the agenda items their alarms I 'm this one may take a take a few more minutes unfortunately but I 'm instead of the extended monthly performance report that we provide to you talking about our compliance with the target and is starting before he goes to the team to go through page by page I just say that the last month that 's been it 's been a bit of an exciting one for our staff organization and a lot of our time has been spent looking at a few organizational development projects the most significant of it as the visioning exercise that we 've just started so sit in a vision for the organization and working on values throughout the organization what the teams as we were at the moment the teams are identifying out and working through values that they can buy into the in result of it or the goal of datas for us to become a values-based high performing organization and that staff can know what at accordance with that so when the final time event is something that the staff generally have really been keen to be involved in it an exciting about but on top of that doesn 't_''_77.49 must continue their comment so i looked at the guys to to take our three page by page thank you guys significantly after made I see that we might have to do some improvement though do you know what those important when Oracle yeah some just some reading absence and replanting have been more significant than that my son is counselor Rankin can I just say congratulations to you for the leadership that you 're showing the organization you are following the transformational process whether you know it or not and you 're doing everything right even working down on the front line is absolutely part of the transformational process and it will make a huge difference in this organization social group Thank You counselor income I 'm sure there are others that would appraise in a further comment please write in a web show them okay okay you 're going to put up with see we win a pretty favorable position and this a bit of a challenge because if you look at the growth and the operating living you a lot of it is in the operational side of the business when you look at their fees and charges and things of this nature but we were able to achieve that without an increase in our employee costs mr. budget so people are working your butts off but they 're actually delivering and I think that 's underlying message that it 's not owning the fact that we are favorable ear today when you look at our forecast we going to be even better you reamed without an increase in the employee costs so I think that 's passing I from counselor Rankin 's comment about the culture that has been created you see it in the rebels the fundamentals as well so I don 't really want to dwell too much on lies because I think they speak for themselves so I 'll let innocent make go through the performance reports and then I 'll talk about the treasury management results thank we come to our community services under what I think you 'll find as we go through the reported as there 's not a great deal of change from where we were boarding last month so we won 't we won 't drag it out unnecessarily in terms of community services you 'll see the only major significant variance is around the increased revenue have seen that 's what we talked about last week sorry last month next just a train that 's continuing with that development in terms of the this delivery that continued in the other room in check could we go as you going through each one can we ask questions most definitely another time the community serves as 125 25k for insurance a mozhet for EM I can 't tell you I 've top of my head but we 'll find out in Elliot Mayson through insurance claims are so what we will form the right over chicken or um gee I 'm sure come packaged well i 'm looking at community services are you talk about why thank you what we find is that the we get the reimbursement it comes in as its revenue so it 's offsetting expenses like there 's 76,000 year-to-date in rural fire costs but we 've received it all back just Exxon pharmaco here today so then on on the community services budget you choke I 'll parade an expenditure of eggs followed by revenues of the same amount at the way why we wouldn 't be budgeting profile and budget for the payment that will show them at their feet in a stretcher both sides cool similar little revenues [Music] sorry guys the parent deliver a message on track and we 've had a slip there are some things may net and remote those hidden change from last month negotiable what a great and flat we will need to maintain up two games exists and learn from the rotating plant site and the bunch of that will be we had my progress is a third world that has been drilled and we 're just waiting for the final testing one right here is expected when I run to completion of that war and giving approval from the local land owner we did it yet to commence serious negotiations will keep us informed i doubt we will i transport and this production and explore and expand or DJ take their time another this is the most complete now so that should show a change next month and is also an increase in raising her alone with the other other years I 'm se this delivery is on trade and they 're going the orange flags are showing up about the footpaths where we have indicated for the young where SA for the most part it should be going out to dingo and the next day she works in the photograph that we were still doing some design work to try and minimize the cost of that project then just on where 's my no safety improvements the word inventor I have always been completed and community facilities excuse me a similar situation we 're in terms of endearment you will note the service delivery a couple of orange flags these relate performance issues that have already occurred with a cell phone I 'm on the service delivery chat I 's my g-string I 'm twelve o 'clock that 's taking alone according to progress place whither 536 similar listen see about rhythm you again we are creating on target with our service Beliveau you will require into him at the theory we had it was 50 of those what a space and we are currently I 'm renewing the syrup on it and car away and it works under way at the moment we have read latch on and the 2 and here s what equipment rather through the chip yes thank you get on took it on that one it 's been going on for how long now that it delays this this is the two only part yeah well as we 've mentioned on this report and a number of other reports it 's entirely reliant on word that internal affairs in rebuilding program in that bridging is unlikely to take place until next summer so this report will continue to show that and until we get it reached material and then a reason we 're losing the Oakridge materials or in some cost efficiencies they were the qaul in the material suits for the purpose that we want rather than trying to source it from another site we were actually have to pay for the material and pay for the carriage and summer that 's when they will look at it well no that 's basically marentina their contract up and running to get the material anytime fine from the 80 completion do you think how long we were going to start until after we had the materials of potentially it 's not until the following season and this being then conveyed to counsel before 12 months moonbeam so basically three years old mmm through the chair would have been now if it hadn 't have been for the issues that the cubmaster head would be a contract to get the dredge so it was supposed to be last summer or the summer that would just come through and unfortunately that didn 't happen due to contractual issues that they head and then they had to go through an arbitration processes each other simply this celebration going for the variances and then come as you would waste landfill doesn 't going to me make this was largely attributable to two years when were still increasing building activity that was generating more waste and also and biosolids that we were taking to the lane foam that those bio solids are reported last month is now going to hear my culture of the only contesting said in your CD or a reduction and carnage for food weigh about 250 to 300 tons of it as the biosolids that an air going to the view me composting it 's looking like the end of you will have something in the order of 24,000 pounds that will be going to the landfill so still never most never get real answers to their job yeah sweetie still agrees on target and verify the winspear and what are you busting whether versus currently at for pricing with contractors at the moment and we 're looking to construct that and make it on the service delivery graph we 've got the rib it saying that you 've seen through previous month just a reminder that relates to the satisfaction questions which come through those to be kicked off again in the next couple of months so we 'll have new figures before we get to the year end and they will be able to be incorporated into the annual report in terms of projects we 've just got those three red traffic lights again the same that you saw last month not significant change with regard to those and other than I 'd say the terrain e-reserve projects i 'm continuing to move forward we 've now got the cultural assessment which has been commissioned and under way and there 's been that meeting on the thirteenth and provide a good opportunity for the community to start to talk about their directions for that management plan going forward still quite a lot more work to do with the board in the in the management sorry and the management committees making sure the views are aligned and their various in terms of the bile reviews we 've gone into a meeting next week and to talk about how we move those forward but at this point via not being prioritized citizens of the overall if you were mold by Laura still in existence can there be used until the new one comes in ie the traffic one trick you have some two year periods where the buyer wall continues to stay in force until such time as you 've got it in review so we could make some of our speed restriction changes now under the Bible route that 's all wondering why we 're waiting for the new one to come after we could if i recall correctly the last time you slip the speed limit by where there was a preference to see review the speed limits in do it that 's entirely on a district wide basis rather than pee smell so that you were getting there the one network approach if you like so making sure that speeds were consistent across and we program of interest and isolated destroyers but can 't_''_883.32 we do that now the district wide good at timing computers as dennis is it 's purely a resourcing issue at this point in time it 's certainly something we can go back and have a look at resources become available suppose at the time the UN 's arrived I 'm in the internet to deal with addition and nothing serious the intention is to deal with that issue in 1718 years as a nation we can perhaps to give you some more definitive timing around when and that year we expect to get on to us thank you if that would be useful thank you this money I 'll speak today they are covered mostly on that they 're triggering management report what I want to point out in this particular page is the gain on sale of properties of 1.4 million so that and well in excess of what was budgeted for that will cover the rest of it and the treasury management report what puppies Ellen is this this is the technical haha and yeah there 's more net but some of it popular yeah some of those still heading to right here we want to get into the confidential fiction in a while I think economic development where again there 's not a significant shift at all from last month religiously and we was shoes are now serving a habitation sorry I 'm okay we want the treasure announcement report one of the challenges and is the fact that the IC are so low you can see as 1.75 distinct and ok our barrington line look with Harry budget as you can see that we look it out and decent returns that we take the total picture you can see down the bottom that we 've been managing to get just over three percent years 88 yield which we 're not going to get rich on that but that 's partly driven by the magnet of embodies OCR but we flick over to the next page if you look at page 153 which is focusing on the t EO portfolio miscarriage on a little bit from what Counsell Williams and were saying you can see that our ears about yield as 5.8 yo yield for the month was just over team yes we have been a bit more active and shears you exceed on the bottom right that we sold 20,000 years there was actually a gain of 13 point three percent over 70 were analyzed to sixty-nine percent and openly abort and that was a gang of teeth win eight percent I have 120 days the annualized set was about thirty 30 scene so you can see what we 're having to do on the equity front to lift their the overall yield to get it up to and that 's what a label it 's really hard when you gain got us a 0 co at 1.75 but even so we Stanley barely living percent of the portfolio and cheesy and whether she is a year for worth fishing roughly yeah and we sold them for assuming I wasn 't fired when we brought them for around the sixth that was within its our strategy when we buy we have an exit price exit program and then the next year 's we saw him at 32 with Wharton about 28 yeah and everything else is in accordance with the treasury management policy is your this video us but really it 's a week your department dude any further comments or questions have a moonlit so moving Thank You counselor cousins a seconder so on the table all right carried [Applause] _"

    "text": "item 5.9 funding a chris from go to honor arrows and yell tennis and spoke to the rebels to fight right coming home and so if you see they stand there a question go to war for this kind of year for twenty thousand dollars what you got in front of you was and I just recognized Rome and Kristen back there where you go when she is a purified based on and decisions related previous Lantern plan which was a reducing funding amount down to seven thousand dollars in 2017-18 you should be conscious that this request for additional funding is actually takes up above the original funding that was we should put in place there were some the recent performance measures wrapped around that funding and particularly highlights and on page 165 lack of a performance report for 15 16 and also the lack of progress towards that self funding model which which cancelled was quite certain to put in place so I 'll take any questions where this allows you to make a decision as to where you want to head with this one any questions that feasibility study at the moment if we decline this round of funding will impact on any of the work that 's happening there well it depends what about fines but I guess ultimately it 's about delivery so yes it would be a fit yes cancel tennis justice just in commentary I 'm we 're well aware they have been some heck out in the life span of gotong little but there 's been a bunch of issue that plays with discussing that an allowance earlier on with the economic review and play right now we 're at the precipice area that we steer the course in my opinion the coordinator has done an exceptional job of being the glue that binds us and I didn 't want to see that week undone so it 's imperative that we have council support today for that people yes maybe I 'm just on a support council as cousins I 'm statement the we are in a pretty important their face and go to o 'neill evolution again just reiterating some my earlier points around around where the evolutions it and where might be an opportunities in your numbers it wish to know something corrales it the chairman of go to reveal it might be committed some speaking time to asking questions if it might help the members within Christians images sounds fine anyone like to come forward and no would you like to say anything Christian why when the question is whether you provide anything that you want to add or or talk about that as far as the assembly ladies in service agreement have been adhered to and that stomach that we quite keen to get rid of origin are going forward the reality is that we have an operating cost of about forty two thousand dollars a year and that most of that is directed towards the role of the coordinator along with maintenance and upkeep of the administration side of things so that 's really important that we do that as far as the self-sustainability a couple starts of that and it really hasn 't taken off and there 's some discussion with the assistance that we haven 't_''_264.2 led by Justin district council officers we believe there right as just a case of actually getting the names of the commercial businesses that could make that contribution and it 's still something a wee that painful as to how we 're going to achieve that so I 've absolutely it is a prime objective and that 's something that will strive for in the coming financial year as far as the feasibility study that 's due to be a first embodiment of this financial year to 31st deal with it about so there shouldn 't be any impact regarding the question that was absolutely Christiansen is any take you a little thank you for coming out and just in regards to the 20k what would like I struggle with this because there 's the feasibility study being done in the East section 17 a and everything else I do see that there is a timing issue that if we don 't do something Ben must be silly don 't what a loser Christine by any means about so I 'm I 'd sort of what he 'll I saw that as a capsule want to help but what 've asked 20 but what is the minimum you would need to tide over until we know where we stand with that sequin 17 review and their feasibility study reduction without something bardot place to take the civil judgment reversed and obviously the student person that will lose going to let years can be difficult so really that was the 20,000 was really a figure that we discussed in conjunction some of the help it up head 3 t.o by district council that really we need i had that amount to give a surety going forward I can 't see much less than 20,000 because that 's going to give us a working budget of just about over forty thousand dollars i SPECT including their funding you receive from DG LT yes GTG MC yes edl tle that we had next twenty thousand dollars a year one thing we have done is that going to become GST registered obviously to facilitate the economic study report that we 're in the process of doing now and just an update on that we actually made a selection is today the advisory panel so we 'll be picking that up in East Riverside but lost the trigger story really got 7,000 in the budget for the 17 18 years you 're asking for an additional 20 yep as a 20 or lap or 20 cm that you 're after seven thousand was still going to be there so what we could look bigger words are 20,000 water through the tube and if we were sitting here 12 months ago and this would be brought before us I don 't believe would put up 50 grand for a feasibility study when the notices and council know the position that go tongariro we 're in and we talked about the non-compliance with those that those performance standards in the contract we 've been talking to you about that and we did talk to you about that when you put the 55 thousand dollars on we made it you 're an item at that point so there 's not nearly dead information yeah so what we machine was done in the past over the funding the goat Maria I was supposed to have got from the with the business communities and in general it 's being favorable these we were looking at a renovated 98 targeted right on commercial property the issue that we 're being having is really just getting the Knights versus a number of properties businesses with the only 280 that that that relate to encourage individuals and as getting the names of those people to get to get a full coverage ability commercial properties so as has been evolving start their most minds we were originally hoping to have the names of their businesses supplied to us but obviously that 's not possible due to privacy concerns through type I district council because he concerns through the column being given the names of the of the owners of the business communities with entering now go to Windsor website creek yes we will set up grade last upgraded our lesson the purses are getting upgraded now in the you hid the website to how long three years in what sort of figures are you looking to spend to upgrade we got a we got a grant or quietly thousand dollars to operator so thank you yes yeah I 'm just so the cheering what what will be obtained a if we decline be a request for additional funds okay so that twenty thousand dollars to according two litters to fund the role of Christine gmail expenses a separate anything that we do on a side project by project basis as funded separately we apply to adverse agencies and charity funding security suppliers to get those sorts of things okay right any further queries of rank well it would appear that go convert their go tongariro will be in a bit of strife if we don 't vote for the 20 grand so do we vote for the 20 year end and they survive or do we don 't vote for the 20 grand and you die shall we be an assumption but that to the motion to the president just when just when port our process things need to be clear and the annual plan so I 'm just around significance so depending on the decision today we just need to make that assessment around this significance or maybe aerial except when you that yeah Garrett do you have a suggestion move your office or 20,000 before whether it was the 20 yeah the court knows role might a velocity so so the fish oil flavor for was whether or not it was 20,000 27,000 that 's really in the annual plan no no it was really matter discussion yes you might wonder oh yeah there was there was there was a question for you so your options day is to not fund it is the paper to fund the fund earnest entirety or a combination the arrive where you could in as a deviation or funding that its entirety is that you could tag your funding to a specific element so you could agree to tag Christine 's salary to a certain point in time in the suggestion was that what until we 've got the section 17 review and all the the feasibility study you could take some funding to ensure that Christine can stall stay employed because when I see it whatever comes out of the review that 's the only taking this can be done by the end of 's longevity in that role is a necessity for us I see is that the we 're only talking about this financial year and the and I guess yeah I can that is the issue would be that we don 't know what that implementation is or what it might be that you need five people to implead whatever it is that we don 't we don 't know yet so I 'm something we can only talk about that 's almost doesn 't faze normal owner than that to keep the home fires burning between now and when we get that he 's about to review out so yes so so no such a cute and I just yeah I to just bring it back on par with the current and coordinator role salary I 'll be happy to do that rather than the blanket 20 and because I think this is about just helping through a period of timing as opposed to just a blanket 20 yes it needs yeah I 've supported if it was thoughtful posting and I 'm not sure take seven classes they have read it in some way they meant here on and off the cuff you but maybe if the recommendation or something around that council approves funding to cover the celery costs niestety over here folks part of the celery coasters funderburg rated by enterprise great lake toba as well to to ensure that goat amador can retain the coordinator position for at least the remainder of the 17 18 year and then it 's up to me to manage that to make sure that the results that Christine it 's always paid until it internet that financial year maybe less than 20 yep yeah yeah okay so can we get that reading sort of any other comments just might much come back to the medium what did it constantly for your website to be set up the initial one was about ten thousand dollars and that was we walked into that somewhat blind chemical okay um well yeah I just wonder if this is an exclusion to it the sort of thinking whether it is some ability to just provide goat or a little with some some support in terms the end of the day I thinking is to recognize that we have an organization that works hit the southern end of the lake for the benefit of the local community and it tries to do it largely by itself I wonder if it 's an opportunity to just put some wraparound support to ensure continued to ensure that this organization carries forward it is something that we can do just putting an alley all I 'd say on that is that we do try and do that not only knowledge the work that council offices which I 'll never say ignore the passionist or rewrite as a game that was out the support of not just the counselors performative obviously the people that work was in the within the officers here there with our best support we wouldn 't survive because the reality is that it comes down to what Christine doesn 't what I do is cheer along with the was the board as well so we are we asking me on the ground as far as that and certainly yeah contribution we get from the saloon the council would be that we thought we provide office accommodation for the coordinator and today only free of charge we 're in say the equivalent and toward the hub each an organization pays their own 20 on center toprol pays their own office accommodation so that 's an example of we 've tried to do things that we came to try it but they will have a ginger I suppose I could just really clarify it 's probably around the fake ticket already don 't have gotten to this position I wonder some specialist support around looking at your your business be looking at you there to the thing might be some appropriate supporter adding some not so much that that offers in logistics it said can we be a step ahead of the game yeah girl so time I just also and because we 've had some issues with am reporting back to the council could we perhaps just send a message that we need you to keep in touch with us about or with the community board or whatnot that we 're at and whatnot so we can struggled at risk of me and also would they so y 'all_._1059.45 so who 's from the community world is only sits on it as well but I had reported back most occasions when things haven 't_''_1064.85 been firing correctly I suppose the council a North a GRT indeed GRT also one going to be a little bit of autonomous about here what song saying about in the board I think graduate will not disagree that there have been huge cleaning problems but they are taking up skilling class at the moment to ensure that we go ahead then it 's done a minute I would grow trees grown up now that 's it 's shauna say a much sounder direction we 've also taken workshop classes on governance which is something that I be fear none of the board really had had experience and my background was in corporate business which is entirely different to to what we are doing here so and there 's been a wake-up call we 've only had one wish off the other one was going to be last night that was postponed due well worth for 65,000 business case study here you know fine so be sure Christine the guy tomorrow we 'll go to it gets motion and some traction phone when I 've seen that report 13,000 120 cash yeah okay do we want to make a decision no and do we have a reservation just say the chair i 'm happy to support that but i need to think we need to signal to that that the purse was drawing out we can 't keep continuing to greater we 've got to a point now where we we are at a no-go ok so do everything for her just then she if I does look at you know given that the mountain playing his declining funding making us a memory that will need to consult on whatever we put here we 'll need a consultant [Applause] [Applause] so I understand it sounds ridiculous because you 're talking about such a small amount of money feeling available to the fact that song two men specifically said that you 're gonna sting you 're going down well never have a difficulty because currently mean when the gods of the annual plane but we 're advised we didn 't need to consult because it wasn 't significant that 's what I 'm saying this is a t30 peasants fiddle well not to any reasons that there 's bears the point of what I just said is that it 's not about the quantum yeah it could be I could be the other scenes as the fact that it 's an un in your long-term plan you specifically said that they were going to be weaned off and by doing this you 're saying you 're not you actually increasing them back up to year one so it could be a dollar that you 're coming in it would be the same thing so significance wasn 't about significant amount of money it 's about whether or not it meets this over because the other is something completely new so do with a motion what just proposed to that suggested resolution I 'm going to tell the Pharaoh quest to ensure about getting the riorcan real time hearing you ok does the thousands every for them till they 're your plans 1818 [Music] the president doesn 't cancel improves the proposal and the draft they say less than additional is able to eat turns out you know obviously we need additional 13 you see the question 13 just put a motion gonna be something that could trigger bit policy then you probably better to go out saying she could start on the 20 and then you can see what comes back from the public and then through deliberations and the digital information make a more informed decision okay all those in favor of what yes against you carry thank you _"

an opportunity to invest a guess and support and partner with tourism you John so that 's two years a couple of procedural things you need to discuss so first of all report actually gives you quite a bit background and to that discretion today the request is outlined is called first news for this current financial year 2016-17 100,000 best us to ambassador item towards that campaign and that under the following year 2017-18 the same bad 100,000 plus GST I need serious approach appoint 6.3 on page 12 of the constant which present confidential items really around the arm the considerations to whether it 's significant this requires consultation advice they 're making moves it doesn 't trigger that so therefore doesn 't require any consultation so I 'll taking questions but I guess it 's such a sensitive discretion as to support and supported with Charlene dish proposal okay thank you mr. over to the organization through the cheery color Quincy awareness that in the current year and budgeted that we have significant surplus as you and as in the council 's performance report for next year the draft in your plane which you will be considering next week and we 'll show you that this step is to day rate increases with effective these particular items at the actual payment that it 's approved there 's an agreement between counsel and through a hoop up on this thank you all right questions mr. riddle mr. mean haven 't you know this religious what is wanting to be achieved I 'm just winging when we talk about a significant whatever the fact that we would be giving the hundred thousand dollars to if you like a commercial operation worries me a little bit and I wanted is very significant human probably the key thing is businesses going and you 're reading the recommendation toward the tourism you zealand marketing campaign so it 's not there wasn 't a cheek going to repair up homeless person was a specific campaign run by towards estate and so it 's not a it 's not a commercial prop up this is about economic development was he indeed well you know we quickly pain and making that money payment to to as an agenda this money along with our AOL money tourism new zealand money and other money that can be obtained and you heard about the discussion about or from the airport and others this morning and that will be put into the pool and that then will determine the size of the marketing campaign and then the bill to be paid by this tree we just mentioned for 17 18 does in do you look at this as part of the terms of marking of taupo in regards to the budget we good distance of each other and we yes so for next year and through then your plan out our recommendation is that budget needs to be increased by a hundred thousand to accommodate accommodate the effectivity we don 't believe that it can be and dispassionately toples current budget penis those papers before you today sort of additional to business as usual to heaven once and have a sunburn and he hasn 't going into one particular budget once again I say to you it is significant I 'm not helping with it i 'm downloading instant SI rincon we could never afford to do the circle in terms of economic developments and the rest of the tiny contribution compete with the benefits the talents going to get it 's a solid investment and I absolutely support it yeah I 'm good counselor Lincoln on this one I just wonder if perhaps if it was to give and cut the body some concert if when it is it me to the deity budget than it is being kept in writing so then they could be some capsicum somebody perhaps and we 've done that in the past with different things with that 25k was tagged for business attraction and things like that so then we know it 's not going to get swallowed into a top hiking I have almost put you wrong so so the hundred world would be saying Phaneesh for the issue is probably in your plane is that 100,000 to accommodate those activities so it 's not there dgo tease budget increases 400,000 I said that economic development group of activities done I hope it 's from the reason he said in the recently notion as well turn into the 17-18 when we do nail tpe that would be parallel that long-term plan and that belong to in plainer subject to submissions by Lopez so yeah so what we 're doing we give you because you 're claiming it 's not significant we 're not giving the right pair the opportunity to have an input in this form of a completion of the paper and I since you were saying demand the quantum of the of the expenditure in given the benefits associated but we do not believe it is familiar cousins those two gareth actually so will you faded out that thick in here it will drop off correct thank you little one and so here comes what they are doing here we 're going to keep it there these resolutions Odin cover the remainder of this year next year and your annual plan as part of forward what what this or what your economic development contribution is entitled amazing opportunity has come Toby supporters but everywhere I read it calcio napoli coppa even Christine 's head count downtown need when you reach recommendation that taco is the resort town I 'm conscious I 'm representing 6,000 people something the lake and I 'm not seeing the strict enough for me so if you hear this morning that that the service will the bus service as an example will ever stop it only in obviously limitation if you could say at the winter resort district or winter you know it 's be using this place around town only get a small brother in my dad I 've just felt less back to the council to something like it won 't happen yeah I feel nothing for a mentality of all parties consume it this is a very special we 've got total spirit okay absolutely so this is about the reason that taupe was as well as i 'm finna yr L&T jolt here looking at opal as town as that we have there been scope of and doing is growing the pie so growing million no money and gown pretty good for anyone my goal would be that once operators and too dang you see those busloads of people going through to Dungey that 's a chicken and egg thing then all of a sudden there 's an opportunity to grow more product down there and therefore there 's that economic slower sure we got past that 's right that 's right you to achieve sir winston israel Taylor bacon count because it 's point you thinking district-wide in the benefits the whole district on Tony supported all proposal we have a presentation from us and they includes this morning collaborative things it 's gonna be an underdog rows of it it shouldn 't reuse the range guide computer business will be to get as a region yes sir King knee injury worship man is totally supportive of everything that 's in see it totally

obviously a almost report for a month november december january and but i think we have seen a few buried and so it takes eight for the summer period are you some summary i 'd say that that it has been a very busy summer period and what we 've had some issues over that time odd odd tiffany class them as growing pains jutsu to to us being so busy just out of interest you today we 've got the scene bh mama indicator report from from our and opinion economist and i think it 's probably worthwhile just sort of quickly highlighting a couple of a so that does make really good reason reading for our district and so he 'd identified trivia that there we had a notable game in population over the 12 months please december we hear their growth and and the value and volume of our building consents the retail spend in significant gains in visitor night stays in in so young so combined that given total district local district than a really strong place the family or dead is dead and we 've had two point eight percent of gdp growth in the last year is approach to the national average of two point four percent so i think the fee to say that we 're punching about their weight above the love the image and is a favor it 's been demonstrated i think by just how busy town has been over late summer period so young for this but good news and flowing on from it you 'll see in the financial results for the for the period it also positive mainly due to due to income and it 's mainly due to those things that I 've just talked about is building something to increase population leading to increased developments and in government contribution but not to be understated about half a million dollars least than budgeted expenses and so all in all that some it 's a pretty pretty positive place to be is right think he cares thanks just agreeing okay yeah I think you 're pretty 100 to do anything that I know it which is fine i 'm more than happy with it actually so probably I won 't reveal too much it is a revenue story of courage key areas here on the front page of the financials is new it stop you just done just make sure people looking at the same teacher though sorry yeah yeah young if we did have a slight hiccup this month then but good news stories about handout that we 've given you as slightly enlarged for the optically impaired by myself let me hopefully might help the financials we need to be working off the handout but then when we come to the performance measures that is the one in the main agenda so apologies for the slight mix-up the effort hopefully we can work through that it 'll return the friendly and hidden revenue is the main point to make beer and that 's across the groups of activities through community service transport these investments of the three main groups the next page their financial statement muses we 're on track in terms of alcaman strategy on debt investments forgot we 're here to cash given us down it yes dear picture a lot better the next page which is just so straight financials again the explanations on the right fear which we 've already covered in terms of the stronger revenue story and coming through and a half a million and an expenditure I 'll pause before we go into the least expected negative 8 sorry yeah I 'm to that manage will skip statement nishat capital expenditures nine million so this we 're saying is 18 million that we shouldn 't seek great that 's great you know what does that relate to trial we will cover that as we go through the activity statements and carry included a yes so yes so in terms of the third page Thea that the key key descriptors of appearances on the right table there happy to take any questions on May of all we can move through the activity statement okay jumping in the first on there Michael talk us particularly around feet in charges that 's probably the key number in terms of the actual financial if you look at the performance reporting a couple of issues that have occurred around essentially responding to issues which have been raised in terms of food safety and noise complaint some you will know that there 's a being a couple of communication challenges there in terms of our internal system it 's led to those those have now been resolved so you shouldn 't see those occur again so do a performance these are sir meeting one hundred percent just hits an update for the voice and very very afraid of kibble spend this year the registrations of interest for the contracts which closes today will be short listing contractors for a request 14 de which will be open through March or April I mean looking to award a tender for that contract and paykel me the only where the one of note the adventure part we 've been working on that food well we have found a reasonable supply of cold water that 's low an aspect that it 's working through those issues at the moment we have one more floaties to do before we neighs a productive wealth the rest of those projects are pretty much running to target transport we had a little bit of a company where their response the custom services over the Christmas break mainly Jeter staff being are off second on leave make sure that by using existing saw resources and Tim priest outfit we meet those time frames Connecticut okay so buddy where are we with the changes on the trailer pain for acacia bay road remember you did some issues with the design three hey you know it 's 4.3 million is about 2.7 were three years of it now and I will and there 's about 1.3 million of fairways from previous years so what the financial report covers both fairway ya know my staff and the community facilities obviously not many projects you will notice through the cupboards red and orange marathon announcement on that graph those usually reflect the satisfaction measures that we have and we 've previously reported at the beginning of the financial year so that that weird you to go out with that in OB satisfaction survey again in the next couple of months and that means that by the end of the financial year we 'll have a new set of satisfaction results which will be able to report to you and then again through the annual report through the community as well so those will be updated really probably the only thing I 'd say they 're on the finances as well as that I 'm you 'll see the season charges there again they 've set revenue story quite a way it 'd and the only other item to note there is probably the you 'll see the depreciation cost for quite a bit ahead the studio the land and building revaluation is at 30 jun 16 where the both land and buildings are various increased quite significantly no depreciation on land obviously that 's been if you like taking care of through the 17-nation annual plans but you won 't see a large variance next here on that wait for this project near that as falling behind that we 've been was treatment flat scan display like this for examine penis on dia doing the greeting of the canal the mob wastewater disposal field we need to want to take some consultation based on an RFP that we 've developed just another note you would be aware that we 've we 're going to start up a Booma composting operation and to deal with a bio solids will the first load was taken in the air a couple of weeks ago and once we get a decent amount of in the compost or rooms or something to show then we 'll we 'll do something more formally but it is operating now in the biology going up to the zoo macaque composting plan perfectly good good news by the way again within reporting through the yerba that we 're not going to be there and replaced reduction and it 's largely due to the economic activity will be helped somewhat by the biosolids that now going up to the resume composting operation and the new cell and the landfill that work is progressing it 's an anticipated additional review they clean to claim that read the stormwater device we 're looking to put that out to dinner shortly for a construction and my win hopefully events and traffic and whatever you does the aerial town for a little also agent Sousa right again democracy and planning you will know that the performance measures are not being met for about twenty nine percent of them again bets as though so section measures around that 's simply about some measures which relate to satisfaction so we 'll come back up with some revised ones once we 've got the energy results in terms of projects three I want to highlight the touring reserve management plan is progressing that slowly so that 's why it 's markers are red it 's very important from our perspective that we do that hand in hand with no chittering tricular it 's very much a partnership project and what that means is we need to give and take a little bit in terms of those time frames on there okay in terms of the cycling walking strategy simply from a resource in perspective we 've had to have a draft by the end of the financial year and that will involve some pre engagement with bike and access type or another interested party so it 's moving along just not quite as fast as we would have liked what that means is the consultation part of that project will fall into the seventeen eighteen year near the beginning the statement of the speed by the reviews being held up means ETA we 're developing a speed management guys depth now just being released in the last couple of weeks so we need to have a look a bit and see what impact that 's going to head the only our speed limit by law and then build that into that work stream Oh to investment activity again a pretty strong revenue story they 're coming through and the season charges around the limbs which is really a community services Todd stuff with regulatory finance revenue 249 kids Iran on your investment really in the other revenues is primarily unrealized foreign exchange gains and and some realized gains there as well driving that number and on the flip foreign exchange as well on the investment activity goals in terms of performance measures that everything 's on track in terms of the investment lastly for me in terms of economic development you know it 's a few oranges they 're simply reflecting not the good years ago we talked about them since it 's our latest market view data but the previous quarters data so it 's simply a case of us catching out in terms of the reporting so the good news that we 've just heard about today will be reflected in your next monkey performances alright thank you very much anything else y 'all probably just quickly skim through the Treasury the year so I 'm like a soap 817 on my report hopefully the phone number has just got a summary of the treasury report at all diving to the individual element solid so investments page 118 probably the thing to point out there is the and the grape and the right hand side the advanced there 's the short-term cash we just reached that limit momentarily I 'm around month is chasing some slightly flows and any in any way and the explanations around that are on the left hand side under performance policy compliance and you 'll see there from the graph on the bottom left that our investment returns the and a dollar sensor tracking very strongly so good news story there he was right under 19 they were cool last month I reported that we would be so referencing the graph on the right hand side the kind of horny horny colored orange e whatever that color is bar on two or three years this week tweet was it last week remember we just got signed off on our extinction to our 40 million credit line included being zero out 231 december twenty 20 so that locks and some good liquidity there so that most that bad jumps over into the 34 year area so yeah very strong on liquidity deal which is one of your key metrics that we measure the same story regarding interest rate risk position and performance here that we 've talked about every month from the descriptions view page 120 we the area to note here shield performances by the end of the year we were confident that that will be a dollar budget there ends page 121 pool and compliance on the credit exposure counter padding on us thanks very much and any questions yes we are the party numbers my questions robert harris this economic indicator that we receive that you will probably get there one of the items of delivery from enterprise where they total so we do pray that through their internet ground just whether a Vera Mulqueen when I mean I put them over in Ely so should we give them for nothing this one 's tailored to the toggle district that 's what I 'm talking about cancer cousins through the cheer squad vs noted on them they pull out the fifth page with a statement of comprehensive revenue and expenses running well ahead for a total revenue was like Ronnie consume has been posted by our development and space looks much ATM but we 've managed to hold our crease no employment off let down by school seems pretty good is it we need to take my castle thank know zem the operating costs beyond and really new up it 'll be good news story that 's what we aspire to be games you submit their noses were not sold but this again if it 's positive in this area I was burning strange goings of positive 54 it doesn 't run pretty happy to see us with the ism report could be confidence in me kneel in the 22 we had actually been quite active to the chair in this regard for example last week we saw commissions Tyler banks years which gave us and three months feeding into simply tune just matter of when we buy we have a exit strategy Thank you Thank You Sorenson cancellation of it sorry and you have a questions or queries of them chief

Barton and when he like and they are they haven 't been to a tree with the damn Sgt copies actually survives and this is gonna hit on some of those files next rule communal that we are devaluing hour later relatively yeah every city and this is making it worse do we really don 't match the eight okay well I suggest probably hero you still asking for feedback on this or or preparing your submission so obviously there 's some commentary coming from the essay I think of those counselors want to feed some more stuff into the system they could do that in celaya hit me to draft up some additional reading that reflects the comments that have been made in seeing that around for people 's considerations I think sir it 's a pretty major thing that was happening so I think previous family Roman and business people in the room I think alerting to hear concerns e so we need to prep shrinking at their economic viability of this plane you can do it equestrian team Washington okay so you know when you 're talking can you pulled it around here could hear that great representative on on that group who is Homer really concerned and and was hopeful that the council would would put us on Michigan and the strong submissions yep alright so that 's think you know reference group that was your maximum that 's mr. Seymour yes sir these dialogue will come to wood yes ma 'am Ivan yet ok ill and so are you okay with it so the process going forward now will be particular counselor said I 've got a concern about this and when will double check the submission and suggest some types of wedding changes and will that need to come back to us again or would be too late would you like to bring it back to me okay yeah so we 'll change this right recommendation i 'll use it the recommendation here 's what amendments and you 're sadly i want your agendas go and write at yep cool all right thank you very much okay do we have a mover for that please look like cancer cousin seemingly God cancel his body all those in favor please say aye hi Jerry _"

reservation number taneously 2016 to 12 one on Pacific relation to vehicles exertion we cannot let them like purposes which is should have delight so I need to redo it no this is a crazy dream okay no public here however I think the council where I like this before until now emotionally she recommends certainly the constrained parts without straps to intrigue which degrees to close the place reserved the biggest at the district by district writing and poetry agrees to make the tiniest religion play to admit the trajectory of the vehicles just going to give a background information is on page 26 I 'll just read it out from wealthy within this position with the count reserve management plan in the Vixen drug reviewers and critics is the super council considers because too long so significant relation to the publishers consistent with the district plan I proposal replacing the relation [Music] of the resolution do we have anyone who wishes to speak against the resolution so i will put the motion to the leisure and just throw the cheetah for point of care of mr. green and just in with the resolution that would pass on the fishing that the simba officers will go away and provide for the addition of happy and whatnot that we have to go away and come back with costing and everything else so I 'm just wondering is this sort of tab for this do we not have to wait for that whipped come back before we can go on with paragraph thing about any good officials obligations that they happen safety eight that was indeed one of the main reasons behind the closure of the appropriate and mushiya and there 's totally over to us into different members to the right the resolution that you passed out us to bring that information back to you it 's not repeat all reading it if this resolution has to pass is that Charlie 's has been moved and seconded and they wouldn 't need to do the matter you didn 't wear his counselors would need to decide what do you think the place that was because otherwise you leave me in a bit of a void and so I 've been good looking at you read to you as a council is to what do you didn 't want her to get me to do for the future the reserve so to destroy to cheers and so based on the phone information right now in its entirety but we passed that would mean that the issue is revisited in its entirety and so because they 're not that resolution it will go to escrow a sacred this rights value f this F s passages is proposed and thinking that resolution data Tooting to the scene that disappears and you didn 't essentially dis back to the resolution previously which was one asking for consultation which is a bit unethical because we really done it so he obviously I 'm Eurasian avoid here we need something after a place what can I went back to replace it with but based on look like when the feeding fifth place for plea to the feeding a petition in foot with train but a suggestion from a community group would be not so the void and helping us food service the resolution was revoked and destroy get my arm around her thank you no point I would still take a decision from you in terms of what you wanted me to Dairy so you would receive the information and but in receiving that just fits on the table I really need a or council would need a a steer in terms of what would let you do more master day and it could be that you asked us to do through the plains it could be that you say it 's just leave it at that it could be it is a lot of different options before you to portforward matter formation Devon can can we prepare the new information yeah until the one could rename she had someone could either propose a new note emotion FF motion was successful and someone could propose a new note emotion at that point to replace it with something alternatively you could complete right so we could dominant they could be proposed yes it could be an altered notice of motion proposed but I understand it 's before the meeting at the moment for the first through the chair our intention in acknowledging and Gareth grains comment sort of the firm resolution of past that English avoid for the council in terms of direction and it is our intention of that motion has successfully revoked to propose a new resolution for your consideration to assist in Japan some direction from Council I would like to propose an emotion can I do you couldn 't hide an emotion right now and you you would have to deal with the first and then do that subsequently what you could do is to pose an amendment to the notice emotional you distribute here I guess I can 't see how we can to move another formation and lean lean avoid to move doesn 't does it make sense I mean we 've already received submissions without having to go back and look a bit through a purpose in the first place so do we if two years of that would be really what it bead store to erase could we ask it we still wait we 've done that we are in December but i just don 't understand the decision in the process but to be close a salute to be done of which neither has been done because the rate hasn 't been done so status quo and it could be 23 years and before that to them because of money and budgets and whatnot and this to mean just yeah i 'm just not sure we should take the lead they were going to sit here and have a a back and forth discussion again about what we want and I don 't think we can actually change the decision like that today so the notes emotions attorney sets as to as to remote that Justin about resolution so they would be ruled until you made a subsequent unless you made a subsequent decision and my children brothers received and officially got a movement if the internet right okay second of speak up we can 't hear anyone come here everyone else to speak for or against in the motion okay yep yeah and I thanks from the unfitting effort was to revoke the decision because of price is because 153 submissions we lift out didn 't I could go with it because to me the place wasn 't followed but rejection Susan and I marry each and every one of our suits read through them thoroughly sorry if from your answering and I just think that information could put to rest from the council offices as well as from the community yeah i still feel fix the right decision is to leave it is reserved for people not for cars my phone also in the region for are fully and steamed being able to get access to [Music] [Music] until the chair that they can support the resolution is rolling thank you from Iberia that they 're the floor and the logic of offices in relation to the key points made about a conflict between a management plan in the district term with a management plan providing for vehicle access and the district plan requirements of vehicles that we kept away do both at the same time without conflict and the two things are not at odd odds we just need to find a means to protect the notable crave and the plane that was for from the camera working group as an example of how that might work and when food today that the plane of the offices still remains the same even after the inclusion of the mission missing submissions they state that a mere opinion closing the reserve two vehicles as the most efficient and effective way to achieve the objectives they have set out i believe and i also believe a lot of my fellow and counselors that these objectives can be achieved efficiently and effectively while keeping the reserve open to traffic there were the local people to keep the reserve open as this theme through an extensive consultation process and indeed with a petition and there are viable options to address the fishes we term about the resolution from december but we also do need to propose the way for to staff and right now they have no direction on this matter there 's no board with 80 years of consultation and whereabouts and we need to restore space and this process that we 're just being through adapt to us as governments to show leadership and provide direction to the staff on the future of this reserve and local democracy plays an integral role how people feel about where they live and with famous throughout the process and this reserve and Google to how people feel about their lives and chem rock and frankly we need to listen to them thank you he 's a champ I 'd like to speak against the motion I want to acknowledge that i believe it 's embarrassing to move on we still haven 't resolved official and we 're looking at going back and reading a whole lot more time on it I also want to acknowledge that the people of general a passionate about this issue and while I may not live there I do understand cash and I 'm very passionate about a lot of issues and I also believe that democracy is important but I think at times we have to have the courage the majority of being right and I do believe we have to protect the foreshore and the lake and that is exactly where I come from and I will be voting against both motion transfer cousin for this year I started it back up from the council speaking for the resolution my gosh what counts was reminiscing about knew what I understand but councillor Truman talking about when it 's been quiet time and children on a for sure I understand that I heart back to when I stood it for Thea counselor was to be a representative of people I 'm at Anzio awarded counselor first but I quality I 'm a publisher counselor first the time they 're awarded counselor as Mike underwriting role but the deflation tell doubt that we must consult with our people and the one crack one crucial issue for me it 's always been to listen to our people with that too i 'm a liquid to represent so education is either consult policy which should counteract that well we write policy we can change policy we can make whatever we want to other people or submission is rated or favorites mr. Miller for 3 against won 't the chamber apical paint the risk of them wanted the chain down that 's six percent wanted a chain up you know there 's a ramming a big public allotted spoken they give us a way through but they can 't they play with me which is so even for consultation but I don 't see how we cannot be session at people and say this happy reserve off chamilia didn 't make good governance we are here for a painful they pay us to be here I can only say that I had to support these people mfi Chancellor 's who wish to revoke this resolution and take their own thank you right now with the base of the trunk suppose not just about your outcome thank you thank you right we did put the lotion to the vote so we have a moving a signal so can I see a show of hands mr. who recede back really you 're at access remote resolution that we still haven 't fully say they 're that I 've done indistinct I 'm not asking you to do and the adapter to you and they where you grow the mind that the revolution absolutely reservations and then the box asking us to do some work and bringing their back but to close the reserve to vehicle traffic and the notice of motion that you 've got on the table at the moment to revoke that resolution you 've got to move and Chancellor Williams women in a second air and Chancellor hoechlin has been important decision and you now need to take a vote on there so it 's like the healing okay well enfant but is for the motion to vote this is known as makes them the snow summation sabado can show and so do we need to explain okay promotion which is contrary to the previous one for the stuff I chose for this to pass sure okay we expect to revoke their previous resolutions usually successful so the resolution was revoked when you were detailing decide what you don 't I 'm sorry for the meta evil and machineries emission stands [Music] want to do we can start again right if you look like what do I do you all right thank you thank you seriously excuse me worthy we don 't work together hmm it will be by to the conversation that you 're having up there and now because it 's a legal matter and I just need to take advice for myself but thank you John thank you obviously it 's very important which is why I want to get it right okay stretchy we 're in the bag that if you don 't vote it 's 44 that will distribute to stat quo yep not a matter whether I 'm just deciding what I need to write thank you okay we 're willing let this point for my calculations waiting for your both energy and I vote to evoke decision but I immediately proposed relation and what I would like to do is to ask council offices to come back to us as counsel with plans pleased with the acknowledging the work that the kalabrian group have done with your plan to come back to us websphere assessment the original pain that we passed and assume both be so that we can look over both of those in a logical and weeded learner so that we as counselors can just take a breath take a breather take everything into consideration with what we 've actually looked at and just go through overall calmly in carefully and make sure we do it thoroughly and get it right that 's what I would like to do do I have a mover for that your remover all right to be something right men cheer the reason has to be something around you move for opportunity to bring back and a assistant of reckon location route plan including customers in how it will be funded alongside a plan of the of they remove without cars in improvements along with coffins for concern for future consideration there be about your friend what I 'm hearing from her gym is she wants both claims done y 'all_''_1695.559 want the plan the plan that the working group have presented Kostas and correctly and so that we can see and cough it out and see how with the parking excedrin yes which we had not seen which counsel apartment and we have no idea of the costings so you can look over both properly endure a proper workshop etc maybe go out for consultation I don 't know that we have one playing with cars on the one without that we say yes the point is make a suggestion that I 'm sure that we gotta move sorry can I do I have a second can I um can you put a time frame on it because it don 't you normally I do that I agree 11 results yep I 'd like to see the plans are going backwards on what the beautiful time frame bikini so they marsh compliment we can make a decision President conversation of record so it could be done by to the April naughty much [Music] how long that consultations I couldn 't go that far although we get the information to you as fast as we can probably March or April yeah through the consultation for the consultation will ever get it right okay that 's what we 're and that everyone is comfortable with it that 's what I want and I 'm sure that 's what the counselors want is that correct do you ever seen thank you all those in favor and I might just speak against it and part i completely agree with you and Madame chairman that we made to get some resolution unless that 's agreeable to all parties but I thought I think we made to go council offices of scare so I would prefer at the reservation fees that they can 't reserve remained open for vehicles and that we do take into account and direct officers to do a detailed design based on the key concepts from the camera working group that include those same data measurement provide protection for the trays and preserve the immunity of anywhere that reserve but also allows parking on the reserve and the Esplanade so I have to be able to good staff a clear direction and a signal to the community of our intention rather than a foot neither camp they are making great drawings don 't account for that I believe so motion so can we anyone else want to be in our state thank you sure I 'd speak again to the pharmacy not confusing messages still we need to be strong and it 's moved forward with it I 'm not saying that the Kim not playing it and given to our business who the correct one but it certainly got some ideal elements in it we should be working with so I can 't agree with your entire resolution well i 'm looking to the community to decide is as you heard [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you and I would support the chair in here and what she said basically the only reason my father Gibson Isis emotion is because it looked a void there is nothing two days and also because the resolution happen december we have not seen the final work that officers were attracted to go away and do so the decisions made to revoking eventually be damned and a food post is just the way we pass the resolution without with servicing 173 submission so i think this is a good compromise and this is a good way forward I think it gives you opportunity and council heckling talked about this is what the community wants that this is what one part of the community wants and there definitely is a strong list of other part of the community as well submissions so I 'm saying about I do believe that this has availed it both sides can they can have this a it 's really as much of the finest me to despair can 't betray me I have to support pillow cases Johnson tickling my cousins and would be to reduce consultation so we 're gonna see really getting the person we 're going up so that most of the cows being on you as well sir ian and unsupported councillor williamson look staff has already indicated that they still below the reserve should be closed to vehicles aidan after the inclusion of the missing submissions so i think its hold until I students in direction but just to keep the receive open the vehicles and that 's weird right oh my god human is that I understanding into account for community-based spoken at flex bhasin business ninety-four percent and can 't_''_2099.16 be any clearer after consultations just muddy water for no reason and God I 'm violet I 'm tire let 's just move on now you don 't have gone Todd I look I understand and I 'd take on board all of those comments but this has been a bit of a protracted process but let 's make sure we 've got it right as it takes a little bit longer side yet that 's my view so I feel that we might as well just get it absolutely right thank you to a working group for all of their hard work and we will certainly take what we can and what those drawings to good use and get the council offices to work with them sorry it isn 't seeking to get for thinking about species so I think like a hell of a lot of different considering how much okay let 's put to the vote staff been baking assessment of the camera action group plan customs and funding we 're inside a plane or be I brought flesh April moving and council meeting yep yep eros in favor raise your hand against Carrie _"

're going to need technical advice to assist your decision-making in this situation there 's pretty limited technical information that we have access to to assist in the decision-making process what we do have is an abundance of different views what 's become quite clear as we work through this issue with the community with a specific working group is that there are growing numbers of domestic and international visitors who wish to use freedom camping at least in part in terms of their different journeys will see that increasing number of visitors using freedom camping saying to have an impact on the community and the things of the community values and they 're seeing that particularly we 've talked about the lights of stump a and five mile Bay and the telephone landing reservist world pinch points recently in workshop you heard about the difficulties Genesis is held down into counter in the the tensions that we 've had there between firm campers and people utilizing the program I 'm at the same time the positive economic impacts which are associated with feeding camping and this growth in visitor numbers what 's a little more debatable i guess the level of that economic benefit that 's derived in endings produce some statistical information but of course we are looking at this issue at a at a global sense a national scale that necessarily doesn 't translate into on the ground economic impacts in the Talpiot community or the terranea community the first thing that 's become very clear through this process is our decisions or so your decisions as

points from campus at this point in time other only the control of the Department of Internal Affairs in the Department of Conservation so the decisions that those departments make impact on the sorts of volumes of freedom canvas that we will have to cater for as a council and likewise your decisions about where you allow freedom camping they will displace campus on to say the department of conservation land that 's something you need to be very conscious of throughout the process in particularly the feedback from the working group there 's been a reasonably consistent message about the desirability of moving freedom canvas away from those late fund locations and particularly the points were people access the lakefront that 's about our desire to reduce those conflicts with day users and if i use your top a lending reserve as an example you 've got people down your looking to launch kayaks or go for a swim at the training for motorsport they are finding a challenging negotiating the way through of the fin campus who are currently located down there there 's also a desire to reduce value of space and I think we 've seen a bit of us tension around feel road as an example where the communities provide the feedback to seduce the army they 're not comfortable with feeding canvas who are paying nothing monopolizing what they perceive to be a high-value space and what you 've also seen through more recent correspondence from the two-photon mattress board is a tiny dafina review around concerns about film campus and their behavior and particularly around water and then interface with water and we 've certainly talked about those issues in the context of reeds firm where we have a lot of food and campers utilizing the river for cleaning utensils or washing themselves an approaching this issue and as officers we believe that we 're first in this governance is to find where you sit on the continuum a one year ago continued you can look to be very encouraging of freedom camping look to be quite enabling about where it can happen at the other end of the continuum you could look to be quite restrictive as some other councils have done and here in your mind that you can 't_''_344.53 put in place a complete prohibition you need to work out where you sit on their continuum because once you 've established that you can then start to look at their the areas that you wish to open up for freedom camping to enable those objectives to be achieved what some what we 've got a new report is a list of year is that were tested through the recent consultation exercise at the end of november am i would like to stress that that list should be used by yours are starting point it 's provided because that 's the list that we consulted on however you may wish to add or remove sites depending on the the feedback in the report or what we have heard indeed through that consultation exercise officers view is that that list contains a reasonable capacity for dealing with the foam camping numbers that were likely to see in the near future in many respects us are compromised it 's sitting towards the middle of that continuing that i talked about now if you wish add more sites and certainly there 's been feedback from some members of the community to say or it 's let 's roll open the doors and be more enabling and see if we can get more of our economic benefit conversely you may wish to remove sites off that if you wish your lease enabling and you 're more concerned about those user conflicts and that conflict in the community particularly the local community from our process perspective once we 've got an idea from you about those sites we will rebuild the draft by law and we we both very statement of intent and we 'll bring that back to you and feedback the senator Febby where you can prove that and then we 'll go out for that for more consultation um the last thing I just want to others I think next item on the agenda is Reed 's farm so please also bear in mind that this project and reads farm intricately commercial because of that freedom camping theme so there the timing of this will impact on the timing of the beads phone consultation then for you to consider the submissions and conducts your hearings at the same time as well so just through the year I guess I back thank you and look like four months council we passed a resolution set for fury road we was a pass by resolution that we allow self-contained camping correct can we not go back out oh can we not add fury road to this in consult on it again because I think quite a strong feeling is that we take these away from the lakefront to take camping off the lakefront so I would have thought that that site would be included as well you can you can give me any sites that you wish to in what you would have seen in the attachments was a long list of additional sites which have been raised through that November consultation exercise well I play em my colleagues support it to add fury road back in the cast likely think I 'd be close to it there is for no idea free on campaign was to try and get the campus off the weight front side Street area which seems to be compromised and acceptable or they caravan association or counter and Association and I would really like to see them off ferry road course dr. just through the cheer at six I 'm sorry castle it 's sort of what i meant if we go out again in heaven in the mix then we have been have the ability to decide its future I would have thought the status quo if we don 't take three wrote into account means that it stays other yeah listen I make us tobacco that I definitely the general feeling is out there that what as long as we 're we just make sure we 've got we got to take it away i mean hear people say i see their prey yeah yes i 'm really clear eyes I 've right they can do it now so through this process yeah that 's what 's getting it better make sure w here as long as they communicate okay conservatively work part of the group last three worker if something does other support for against so I think obviously going out the consultation you can either it can stall that it 's included you can still be depending on the consultation can make it nor taken out you can 't do I just you know I just have you shown a bit of intention there that very rates too low in consideration I think that 's the whole idea of the thing is to draw on yes I throw the chair oh I will withdraw that because the teachers to take it off the lake not to France that I understand no just as long as we go for the pro so make sure they take she done yeah yeah oh and any other questions of look counselor rincon i will just clarify with me Nick the consultation group someone asked me whether it had any campground operators if it did it had representation from the the national group as well as local campground representation through that you yes sir listen obviously I 've with freedom free it was almost leap to see the free camping a freedom camping or free camping is obviously over non self-contained bansal you the clear very very good motive a human grounds and as opposed to freedom camp included of self-contained you may not stay in camping ground so obviously oh we need to have a spare situation where we can encourage people to go the camping grounds it also could be also sick that people aren 't going to do that so we 're offering puts off in God 's questioning of us with her lantini commander robert street if they were to be allowed will consider does in the draft board or going out for eros they can they can park or overnight there 's be some pretty strict rules around there it will type specially cuz this thing to do not go through this list of the locations yes to see we 're all on the same track and that yeah you 've got obviously you consulted so far you 've got you know so many support some of your pose on page 33 so perhaps go back to page 25 reads farm so mmm happy to consult on the basis that all campaigns via written street which is the to be we were pretty happy around the council tab all about it but you 've got quite a few opposed to it or I presume those schools and things like that are they also in their locality you 've got the curve a kind of rare and cup of preschool operations and it was definitely some feedback of a negative nature from those operators concerned about things like rubbish and security and danger to children so we were getting some feedback and very similar with regard to iron matina streak which is a boxing onto the playing field that the Talpiot primary school use they were raising similar concerns about danger to the children and additional rubbish and secure the issues to can those issues be addressed during the bylaw process yes and no and the reason I say listen though is that there may well be management responses they can deal with things but me as I said at the start you 're also dealing with perceptions and we can 't necessarily change perceptions through a management of response and perceptions around the safety of children is something can work my name to actually use chloromethane Street supportive of these vehicles we 're very much looking for a direction from you as governance so I mean is that what working the thought that was actually parking or through a poem in town street near the children 's III achievers a few parks viewers were the toilet rockers walks obviously even with soph assignee was looking at his self contained vehicles are still often further be were facilities like that yes so there was an option considered it was supported for the support of the working group is supported today carmit a nice trick to be varied the working world didn 't reach consensus on a full list and the same level of support for every site yes yes now really and there were definitely different views based on the level to which people thought that as a town we should be motorhome friendly so if there were people who wish to see very enabling approach then they wanted to see more areas provided if there are people who listen client to be enabling then there are fewer is concerned about what we could possibly term secondary sites so I guess that 's why I made the point you really need to work out reuse set on that continuum and then we 'll have an idea about how enabling and therefore how many ear is how much capacity you wish to provide through the chair you just had a pre consultation process where rate payers have responded with their thoughts as per page 33 I think you need from a consultation process going forward to be seen to listen to what people say ok so was anyone even on that list the air probably the best way forward is absolute no go alright some of the times through there was 70 17 have opposed it and only 14 yes ok so don 't miss out stricter surprising quiet evenings so yeah record stream is the same 50 10 games we won cool so dougie town center obviously I 'm not a fan of having convenes in our car that is what my office and I get out there yeah there was an officer yeah well you look up about board were the same if I 'm not mistaken you with the antenna and Gareth it was discussion about that I can 't remember fully but I think the community board went to Akira they were wondering why wasn 't on that other car park close to a toilets were the questions that were raised against the question was right by charlaine I think it was yeah why I 'm so far from the public toilets and Clayton you mentioned about being close to tumblr a junction yeah more support of that ok what 's the best way forward he and nikki and like general feeling is we 're so happy we 're still okay with freedom can 't_''_1118.31 be like yes there 's ever a heavy of a freedom camping but not not on the lake margins or like close to lake so these are the options here would come up with so what I 'm what what I would like to know and we wanted to go around the room I 'm not too sure whether their way might be long-winded process but are these going to be cut to the chase reads farm yes briquette street I know there 's a lot of pose there but I sub personally I think it 's certainly a stolen the CBD and it 's vacant land unproductive land at the moment and and you don 't think me it seems a sensible logical ice but I can understand that concerns of the educational people and things like that but whoever we can address those for the bottle prices I can 't some support and the table for that all I think spring I 've had quite a lot of feedback just on the street and people think Rickett street is hideous and that the we shouldn 't see and people do but we are going to make it look pleasing and this is what I 've kept wearing week will be required to do some lowering a clear away rubbish the weeds you could create a pleasant outlook we discuss with NZ dmca gotten out on site talked about the appropriateness of that so they were they were supportive they can see the potential there I think a lot of have to do some stuff isn 't there to that was too in regards to look at Street what costumes for the infrastructure Sophie actively the rate payers will be picking up the cost of that infrastructure there is no amor report and this is not free camping because there 's always a cost and that cost comes in terms of people having to pick up rubbish clean toilets provide toilets as the case may be like a street and that cost falls on the right path so while they while they can may be making some economic contribution to town the cost of their facilities in the maintenance that of their facilities fools on the right path that that 's the reality in terms of briquette street and web signal that if you 're going to make that a substantial area for free and keeping in the future with expect that you may want to look at providing some toilet facilities because the indication is that even self-contained canvas like to have toilet facilities would expect that there 'll be some rubbish reciprocals in place and therefore some operational away are weeds and so on we can do the basics in terms of existing budgets but those additional costs of putting in new toilets as an example will be something you 'll have to budget for as per the in your flame process through the chair in addition to that there is part of that record straight yo yo debtors potential commercial development land use of them I would not like to see that opportunity removed all the holes on infrastructure see it is enough underground infrastructure okay Rickett street yes or no around the room counselor pack I 'm not a feather but I 've been this is about consulting on science widely so I sort of blog while be sitting in there I can 't read sites I don 't not quite sure why I just gets off on them hmm Oliver this absence by mer-boy about catnip ideas it 's a while or process so we go out in with the selected sites so two documents will go out for the community one will be a draft by or which will have the sites that you the second document will be our statement a proposal which says why are we doing this by or why do we think it 's necessary which sites are we decided to include for which reasons in which sites have we decided to exclude and what are reasons for that so for example fury road will be sitting in that statement proposal with an explanation of why we don 't believe that ferry road is an appropriate place so the community will see both of those documents and have the opportunity to provide you submissions on both of those studies I 'm slightly more like well yeah but I mean I have been a fan of record straight from the start so what 's your suggestion neck leave Morlan and then people tell us it 's it 's very much your decision as governance trilogy others call it a decent consensus with all these sites with up with the working group anyway yeah all right just a clothes peg leg your worship island I 'm assuming when we 're talking about the commercial side you 're talking about that road closed obviously that that 's important request now if we if we cared that site as a as a commercial side I will how did we access it would we access it right off the corner for wicked street and down one access oh no I think you would come off as a Waikato street yeah well that 's the commercial song well the commercial opportunity exists and low in behind the two existing sites I believe going on 20 30 40 and 44 see those numbers by the buildings and behind them that would turn to 34 and further for 20 30 40 and 44 see them a bit on the left there those buildings nope the land and behind that we 've had some interesting Shawn as far as commercial development okay because because they p sub side of 44 was actually a road closure some years ago the greenpeace that the side of 44 of all that 's what use me as a commercial side and they interested we are starting to hear there 's actually behind those buildings okay sweetie so in fact it could use to nobody 's doesn 't come into the tea as well yeah yeah yeah okay i just didn 't want to put a method if if we feel like these are some commercial game i just flagging that this it 's not all the briquette street this is showing what it is or olympia story there is no deal for camping exactly and that 's my concern yeah so do you need to draw a line and before it goes into a public arena even place that we do yes surely when I there 's plenty of room up towards where the wicked street corner for a freedom campaign truly steady agreement yes stop here so thank you Miss perspective we could adjust that plane thank you but commercial reason to see see where we could adjust it to the line on the plan certainly who do they make you stuff okay yes thank you very much inside at the other end near 45 well we actually talked to the Early Childhood Center about the potential to stop that entrance at that end and actually create a turn around the other guess and so there are some little management solutions that we can put in place to address some of the concerns about vehicle movements I guess what you need is some direction from the community about the principle of having camper vans in their locality okay oh I shall live done deal with boundary adjustment so I 'm attaining a sea bass so a suggestion here is to just put them all out and then will soon hear back as to what 's not desirable as that sound it 's funny really okay so then the recommendation layer 5 bar to insert the areas as pure as pH 25 yes you can do that Nicki and perhaps have a look at their boundary changing where they are some commercial opportunities of them I would not like to let commercial opportunities disappear that 's for sure they bear in mind austell only 25 minutes those sizes okay yeah five other ones through the cheer up deep-pocketed us to go with thee and that consensus of the working group forced to close Fiona and stick with page twenty five sacks this through with the integration but I 've also Riverside Park a pretty touchy one obviously it was discussed with a weak growth newest obviously divided opinions on that one there are no even with discussions at council chamber the other the workshop wish it wasn 't it would obviously convict of users and etc and maybe environmental aspects but what I 'm not too sure why 's it can not be included on the drug why would you go out to consultation it was just even with sister a few packs down now they 're obsessed facilities they are live on staying neutral on it I 'm not saying I 'm their prejudice I 'm just thing could we put on the on the list as well any got the dump knee the reason that it wasn 't area near i balance my papa me and consignment five members the others were talking so say there was there any of those are you developing he believed by people using it wasn 't doll or in center sa so that 's why you didn 't put that on for five steel carbines through consultations and what we needs make really clear through them to do the process was that windowsill car parks rather than when people say Bruce like park I think they in the major that 's going back to the campground and no one 's talking about going back to Hendrick okay um yeah what 's up what 's feeling on that right I 'm I think we might be I really can 't afford miss my world I kind of worship [Music] babysit yes I counselors homes let 's get out here and not to be on the list personally just cuz i 've been involved with such a long time I find it quite fascinating mr. chairman that we 're discussing the Riverside paid which we of the old camp and grant was but we 're going to probably create another camping ground somewhere else which could be well a Trickett well we did when we closed the motive comments like um casal body which one did you open top ten life is it a golf course it 's still going yeah so we did that 's what about chemical no I don 't know any hot yeah I don 't know exactly non-healing your kisses yeah okay senior your necklace McDonald 's Burger King cap a quina to in the appetite for that one I think there 's enough capex and the other and that 's where we put in your charge station so I 'm just finish here and can I actually move the recommendation on page 22 and sitting there and the site 's listed on page 25 is the area 's clip okay it 's like another bug no sir vaccine up like a likely thank you very much neck yeah I kappa sticky run 0 so this hood dad and they look forward to this process going forward all those in favor please say aye alright inched carry _"

    "text": "okay 55.1 if I could just ask the deputy Mia to take to you promote things okay okay so look thank you it 's mother 's been ongoing since two thousand four teams had a long German determination and that over that period there 's been a collection of reports which are being presented to elect the members they 've been civil rounds of consultation or engagement with the community together views on different aspects and you 've had some technical information such as arborist advised along the way as well all of that forms a body of information which you need to use in terms of your decision-making today but essentially sitting at the heart of the meadows of decision no bounds the level of vehicle access on to the reserve which you believe is appropriate and in considering that there are a number of I guess elements or meters which you need to weigh up and one of the key ones is a responsibility around the district plan just a plan identifies a number of trees the popular trees on the reserve which are considered to be notable since that means that vehicles should not be parking within four metres of the base of those trees is a policy indication that our greater level of protection would be desirable and a practical sense that for me provides a very clear boundary issues of erosion and particularly for sure emotion have been raised through a process you 'll be aware that we 've got the lake taupo erosion in flood strategy which was developed jointly with why Carol Regional Council and they 've submitted very strongly in support of reducing vehicle movement on the reserve as a way of maintaining the vegetative cover which they see is quite critical and certain offices support has been quite critical in terms of maintaining the stability of that for shal it 's clearly a piece of reserve which has undergone erosion in the past we 've been through a field of annoying period of weather conditions but the expectation is that erosion will continue into the future as well car parking is a seems to provably a critical issue where we 're talking about all sorts of things in a tower bell to consider at the moment people are being able to drive on to the reserve and park wherever they wish now which has certainly made things easier for individuals from terms of unloading equipment and having things close by what we 're talking about is potentially change to that arrangement and therefore displacement of that car parking in a positive sense there are other parking options in the immediate vicinity be on road or the filmed car parking which are buds part of the reserve it 's also the potential as I 've talked in the report to enhance some of that car parking and therefore increase its capacity into the future that clearly comes at a cost in terms of costs the financial cost very much depend on the sort of outcome that you are looking for I guess is a general guide the mail that you 're looking to enable vehicles onto the reserves the greater the cost will generally be and that 's based on the requirement to put in protection for the trees through the concept plan work that we can solder on we talked about 's also been most discussions about the extension of the road to the end of the reserve but the last the last fact I wanted to talk about is in my opinion one of the key ones and that 's the growth of Kendall since 2007 when the reserve management plan was adopted we have seen about a fifty-seven percent increase and the usually resident population kinloch has gone through a bone in terms of population that 's expended expected to continue into the future we 've gotta be only a little over a third of the structure plan area is still to be developed and can lock so there 's going to be new people there there 's going to be more holiday homes their own people looking to utilize landed a peak what that means is there 'll be more pressure on the finite resource which is the lakefront Reserve Land one of the questions you 've got a way up is what 's the best use of their land looking to the future is it is it a mixture of parking and picnicking recreational activities or do that balance should be shifted towards allowing people to recreate on there and not so much of the vehicle parking so those are the issues those are the things which will believe you need to consider looking for JH and I 'm more than happy to take any questions thank you things like just you mentioned about our reserve pressure on reserves and there 's a third more of their place to be developed this council take any steps to rectify communal living space issues it because obviously we would have done this when we structure the whole setup in the first place I would think and we 're going to put more reserves we allocated as part of that development process out there with these a bit more reserves so as as subdivisions take place there are discussions about specific subdivisions and the requirement for reserves and and that is something that happens as a matter of case I guess the point I 'm making is that the lakeshore reserve is a very finite resource so even though we may create more open space reserved the areas in subdivisions to be that people wish to go and sit beside the lake when they picnic you can hear you right yes what will keep we Kiwis here so my concern is it really in the day we hold the strings as the development of that area we could stop at admission this before it 's not that I want to stop progress there are some grown and practicalities around council pulling down the shutters and saying no more growth and kinloch as many we 're responsible we are going to be responsible then it 's just a question that were concerned there 's a thing that concerns me I agree with the proposal to close it i think that late is our most precious jewel without it we would just be a little vac auto town and i think we really have to protect it and while i would never advocate anything much that oakland does it does have reserved at Long Bay on the North Shore and it is a huge reserve and no one is allowed to park on the reserve there 's parking spaces and then closed going to offer and people trudge along with their canopies and their picnics and their barbecues and I didn 't like it to forget what they 've got used to it and it 's now just a matter of course and it does protect a precious piece of land and that 's what we 've got to do as far as I 'm concerned make pain pain the freshman once only detail planned at me the instructor the prophecies to roll please yes I 've got so this is the concept plan that even having consulted the community about and the plane was intended to ask a few questions and sink community feedback and Indian see on the right hand side there 's the blue dotted line that 's extending from the point where the current chain is forbidden in Ferber vehicle movement I 'm fluid into the reserve creating a turnaround area you also see some so Yoli green shaded areas those are essentially both protected here is the minimum protected areas we would have to have around each of those notable trees and the one of the questions being built was the approach you took around that little protection to simply put our post and rail fence or do you look to use a different combination of ways of keeping vehicles away maybe some of that soft landscaping maybe some use of rocks potentially put picnic tables around some of the ages so you can look mix of different ways of keeping vehicles away from those areas they 're all comes at different costs depending on the sort of outcome that you 're looking for but very much the focus was does the chainstay rivers and does the relative extended war as the status quo maintained or is there an alternative look I have a question can you tell me is there a ski lane along that part of the beach place I just can 't see it marketing I believe the ski way is to the left of the Scotsman 's ramp as you 're looking at the yes oh so to the left of the page now one of the interesting things that will know that over the years with regard to car parking is that map so it 's just after you 'd ever met tees to be used by those who go and launch their boats at Scotsman 's rent and then in park their car and trailer in the parallel car parks on the road if you were to change the configuration of their car parking two angled car parks what you would end up doing is moving those people in with their car aside because in the boat trailers over towards the other side of the marina we 've got the opportunity to park on you the main beer so you 've been displacing that sort of car parking as well we read somewhere that would on how many car parks with it you 're approximately add I think you 've got about 17 there at the moment you need to about 46 depending on your engineering but it 's enabled pack doesn 't scare sony with that last comment do you still perceive that people would use the Scotchman trunk and going right way when and park on the domain no because in reality what 's happened as a couple of of that Scotsman 's ramp to ensure that you can only launch very small craft is there the decision that counsels previously made so in reality well I think we 're going to see is a lot less usage of that scotland 's went particularly for the larger boats which will now be forced to go around and utilize the proper boat launching facilities in the marina interest in consumer yeah I guess that 's why the challenges will you make change you 'll never a hundred percent certain about how people will react to that change and we 've talked about car parking if you change the ability for people to pardon vehicles right on the reserve and drag the chili going out and put it next to the car if you change that scenario for them they may choose to go to a different reserve they may choose to park somewhere and drag their equipment down or they may choose to walk down to the bench and not take a chalupa people 's behavior will adjust in what we 're not a hundred percent certain on is exactly on the other side of the marina you 've got a turnaround here in some car parking next to the playground that 's an area that enables people to drop off or park in are able to walk very fast we may well start to see that side of the marina utilize more by those sorts of people as opposed to the site and it 's it 's only run to actually make some change exactly what those implications will be if you John yeah thanks rich obviously I 'm one of their majors responsibilities just predict particularly integrity of that Beach throughout through our role throughout history of strategy and by doing the Odyssey is going to maintain the quality of for people to enjoy their Beach as well but on the other hand we have done I do you take on the council cousins point is you mentioned that the growth on the in the district it can log error and will hold their makers and residential development where they run you know we have to consider the the peak periods would people went to packing and packing them so I 'm teaming towards thinking I don 't want to see the whole point to see the whole run beach and closed off for like to see not what I want is here to complete you open as well as a status so I 'm thinking of the minute you 're thinking leave it open what are you sinking part is reserved opens you know status quo because it disturbs through mt r ask the question done page 14 of the agenda paper states in that if the reservist closed to vehicles and comply with the district plan they really have a look at the reserve management plan regards of parking at states allow vehicle access and parking within the reserve and designated areas only what does the district plant actually say for reserves vehicles or no vehicles this your plan doesn 't have a view on parking on reserves the district plan talks about the notable trees and it talks about not having vehicles within four meters of those notable trees ok so the currents in the agenda that states would enable council to comply with the if you close the reserve then vehicles can 't part with them for mayors of those trees and you will comply with your own district plan if your erect barriers around the trees as long as the ax four meters away from the base you will still comply with your district plan at the moment you don 't because cars can drive directly onto that reserve and park underneath those trees thank you yes I from reading all the material and from going to site visits to see it in from also visiting during peak periods I know the area well it 's not only they can lock residents that utilize this but lots of people from the outside the area come in so I think that it 's important that we put that we preserve this area like a particular environment and I think that 's more important than the convenience of being able to park closer to the water button saying that we do have a lot of people traveling in two to come here so it 's not not local so we need to do parking and we look at that now not let 's see what happens I think that 's essential that we we do something about that because by closing it off we are taking out so many cutbacks and it 's just going to put that problem back on the Wizards and the area so yeah I would like to see them the recommendations it will look at poker I sent an email out to all the counselors you 're all about the trees that it there because we didn 't ask for people 's thoughts from the trees about a consultation process and the comments and the feedback was quite strongly strongly held that getting stronger there was a large thought process of them that I see to buy down they used by date at 20 to 50 years the maximum life is good and sleepers lombardi papalis we never actually asked the community what they really wanted and I think that should up on Colette ferocious be even lower on this plan here some of these trees actually coming out already up they don 't resources need to remove some of date I supposed to agree which trees are they that are coming out which one 's the owner I couldn 't tell you exactly which I believe there 's three just need work on due to their health and I guess what I read is that the responses to those questions from the community the arborist considered the health of the trees and his advice was that the balance of the trees open those through an LLC condition n didn 't need to be removed the study I 've done the do every week every piece of literature on the internet from qualified arborescent horticulturists say these trees you don 't punish I 'm apoptosis 60 years they become unsafe and they degrade from their ownafter and it should implement on public spaces and if we remove these trees yes we attend resource consent to local trees I get that but we 're gonna have to do it anyway for some shouldn 't we have included as part of our consultation process for their community because that will change the whole landscape deal when I spoke to the arborist counselor out there that 's what should be there not these trees even though they had some historical relevance to the area he even had that conversation so I guess just to clarify the reason that the trees are in the district plan is because they were promoted as being notable by parts of the community and then went through a full schedule one process under the RMA involves public submissions to clarify whether the community consider them to be notable and whether they should be included in the district plan so that process has been undertaken and the community had an input into that process and the decision that was made was that these trees are significant enough to be placed into the district plan and have protection now that 's not to say that you won 't change over time but if you wish to change that the you guys don 't ask I 'm saying the communities the opportunity second wasn 't working spirit of it again because that they were very few in there Finny they said this entry he didn 't maintain but most of it why Britain the submission of a up council 's what they really have our best price or I wasn 't looking for as when I saw and Jacob to the just follow on from it because we tend to page six of these submissions regard executive councillor Cousins is talking about is written here by a particular submitter who states over here now Bruce and speak the poppers who are strongly of the view that apart from any risk of the trees fall in the shredding the branches pose are all possibly due to injury for those sheltering he goes on to liability who 's like who 's liable if those trees tip over treed do damage or injury I 'm variable to provide you a little advice but I believe Nigerian o through through the cheerleaders the short for the council to be liable if it hasn 't taken all reasonably practical steps to increase unknown his it my understanding is that those trees are under regular inspection for the council barbarous and so in that way that 's also a heads up that you 've referred to as the decision is made to close the resume you referred to very little maintenance or cost of that is what it 's my perception really and truthfully if we do close this reserve off then we should wear the landscape it can make it a nice area and that would involve because I think this has been a downfall of this this particular piece of reserved over the last probably 20 years the council was made decisions in the past but we 've never actually pulled the budget to develop the reserve properly from the decisions that was made earlier and I mean if we close there is evolved then to me the road should be removed and we should we should really write escape it so there is a cost and in that type of decision making would you agree Oh the decision is up to you they I guess the objectives that we talked about in the paper are around protecting the trees and providing recreational space for what account community in the future community it 's very much a decision views governance around the quality of that you may choose to remove the roles you may choose to put on significant landscaping and both soft and hard and that those are very much decisions that you make regarding any reserve space that you have through your angle plans in your long-term plan budget decisions the comments in my report are very much about trying to achieve those objectives and what 's there what are the costs associated with the different ways of trying to achieve those objectives if you place a barrier or chained up at the entrance to the reserve and praveen vehicles going you they leave all of that reserve space open for recreational activity without that conflict with vehicles and it costs you the price of a chain that 's not to say that you won 't want to do further enhancements over time to that reserve I just wanted to confirm with you that when we did the site visit we have a car 's head beam was a Miss and where they hadn 't been was actually quite a pleasant spot was still the road there that you might want to change or damaged in the area that the cars had been so it was then that caused a lot of the damage to the ER not to the trees but in the grass yes and that was some of the feedback we were getting through the last rounds of round of consultation we talked about the extension of the road we 're a number of submitters who talked about the benefits they derived from having the chain in place and there being a regeneration of the glass in the recreational area at the end of the reserve thank you through the chair and I sort of like Council Williamson I 'm of a mind and that may be part of the reserve open because I think once you get you get there the barriers put around the poplar that 's going to reduce a lot and when you read through the report it does say that there 's likely to be reduced vehicle damage to their for shal vegetation and whatnot which WRC was submitted strongly on however the democratic process was that the reserve be closed I would like like the world to be mindful that you have seed neva seen three quarters the semester Smithers wanted to stay described through both consultation processes say if the consultation is worth being regarded I know of tough to make our decisions on to the public opinion but tunnel so I 'd like to know peps Dennis would you be able to give us an idea of the timeline to put in the parking and rough of the cost you know how long would it take if we decided to close either by Christmas today I wouldn 't know at the stage counselor that would depend on the availability of our Romero protecting what it 's doing really is that wouldn 't be a quick process I don 't have an answer for you I 'm sorry your such short answers it 's um it may also require some additional tie ceiling and curving and channeling which obviously require some sort of team to process so that that would increase that time I think realistically we 're probably unlikely the head of the arrangement of that car parking in space in place would certainly be in place for the 17-18 summer I would tend to agree with those who if it was agreed to close that I would say we would have to have the parking organized prior to that we 've talked a lot about the parking in the area and directing fronting the reserves the other consideration of course is there is potential to park on the road and the adjacent streets now that that potentially causes some tension with adjacent residence there 's something for you to consider yes so how do we all feel do we have a mover for any of those suggestions which are lowered moves the recommendations on 5.1 page 14 23 them it seems the submissions agreed to close the reserve two vehicles agrees to make changes in the reserve management means I 'll move that way and on second deck vehicles you might like to speak for the motion or against emotions are we having to add to it I guess I must really looked yet so yes I mine are the two big mines the packing can I think it 's just start every single car parking needs to go ahead and also that we look at the timing so I think we need to leave it open the summer because I just think it 's going to impact on the locals too much we just climbing over this is your duty to pursue degrees to post reserve two vehicles once additional parking has been created which I get wait but why we 're quite the water so many ways so they announce that pleased commissioners the mover and seconder so the additional parking will be having been down there recently again we 're where you moving it towards the marina correct knowledge just next to Scotsman 's ramp that right go to the site visit Oh it 'll be near to us once during the summer that 's one really knows yeah yep I just clarify that would mean leaving the thing where does that you for the summer chatter set up yeah yeah we lead a time where does okay yes I can read so we don 't close it until we have this parking in place and done yeah that it be closed you move that the chainstays you but just until the parkings done so I support you but I also see the immediate area yep that 's all you need to seek in da you Steve so you 're gonna you 're gonna move you sitting there on the meatman so yeah I mean it 's not a criminal if maybe Nina I 'm so good for singing better maybe a secret message I want emotions because i 'm not there although i was taken the elimination secular so there 's all those in favor because it right now is that an amendment or is it added to is a course of action to take place between month to the resolution well it depends how you want to read that so number one would stay the same number two will be released to close the resort to vehicles and that would be once the additional parking has been created but exhibited so that would be the mu- yes they don 't do it you 'll fight in two parts one is only me much based on the great way just one okay don 't need there can we read that whole thing out change please so there 's three carts boosters receives the submissions in relation to can lock brake font reserve and number two agrees to close the reserve two vehicles once additional parking has been created and three agrees to make consequential changes to reserve management plan to reflect the closure of the reserve two vehicles there 's no talking near of the populace the bestest to give it a sepia it wouldn 't see anything else but while I was up there as we are going to be doing words to their area to put barriers around the poppers are we not or is that because Henry don 't leave it off do a quantum no but but it would be works the other kids was from three hours by the young ones there regardless can such an investigation work out near back to the tree then replant impact upon the reasons that and I agree with Barry that I would like to see some sort of landscaping and other work once it is is closed no so now what we do you could I move rid of cylinder okay the only you my commercials to speak in favor or against the reservation same time um I 'm suppose I 'm sitting with them council Williamson on this one the man who 's been here the longest out of all of us us into the community Maggiore what the community wants I thought that 's what we were here for I just want to remind councillors of that research I hope I 'm still not happy not completely here to the state complaint can be closing it completely but not with staying effect I do respect the the beach has to be protected and the trees to be particular will and incur some costs so I still maintain its then I don 't you I 'd have to speak against it I i know this process has gone through a correct process it 's been a lengthy process and it made decisions previously to this particular decision has been submissions or support careful answer because I think this decision is is put on more actually consulted on we 've we 've changed it through closing this reserve we will now change in quite a conceptual visual effect who are the papers properties by put in further Paula Paula came down on the other side of the lake Terry 's the other thing is that if if one would have made the decision over here to close the reserve and I would definitely have voted for closure in the Scotchman ramp because that does implicate on the pocket oh [Music] definitely a favor if it is closed that we do do a complete landscape plan and price it and put normally funded properly because that 's been the downfall of this reserve as I 've said for a long time and so therefore I fight against it because the resolution ruling is only talking about car parking and only protection of the trees okay so we 'll do a show of hands to see who 's in favor of the resolution all those in favor wish my going to be recorded please the motion of past the municipal division a nurse refer that others can _"

Lewis chief executives report hold on i 'll start off in better velocity me come forward with Lewis Carroll ward I guess so well I 'd say to start right still operative el sida my report rushing through a little bit busy period as the end of this year ask you some things do something surprise I guess but I really emotional around the number building pc 's busy we 've been but we of the economy has been for a drive around 10 lock or up knock out your see that in action development in towners as amazing so they obviously is means that our team our am a realtor ET more quickly busy but also means that we 've got more growth coming in for governor contributions of rates go for as well a good night for us i 'll explain interest in particularly pleasing that the team have been able to do that but still behind which are most computer on a country into the number of days that taking the process that you 're seeing scriptures grow and so i 'll probably report and that 's the gentleman in front of you turn the city of austria just before just before we do it we going to come into an original report of a covering of all you more volatile it 's a it 's a real man o meter you once a year move said that 99% of the dogs in the district have been registered put of us remember a little while ago an email from yourself then came out and said no and dogs wonder whether we change it just 90 focus in a nadar knows we know about everything here yes thank you you got some dogs we don 't know about i 'm not going to get personal again i would say that 's an incredible incredible food wait a minute patient might be a pleasure so back at the Royal provincial seeker from walking Counsell they were applauding effective around eighty percent so she could have said to that I was what 's the ways up Stan the other day and she it 's the Associate Minister he 's good looking at these issues was extremely was speech dog with a bone yes I 'm take you to page 32 so it says for the last meeting you in through this this is the high-level summary more illustrative food and so if you look through this from your rates revenue yellow and other operating revenue less your operating expenditure you 'll see all those looking fundamentally on track there with just morally favorable lenses and in the breakdown of the full key expenditure items their personnel costs through other expenditure or below I 'm tracking on on on courses as with forecasts they probably the kini thing tonight on there on the first page will sure you will come through is you basically operating revenue 1.5 million favorable so that 's the Lord Otori fever that 's around the regulatory income over the page 33 just the more of a balance sheet side of it there again pretty well as forecast in terms of the bones in cash due to the net cash position of 48 and capital expenditure died four million you can see the the graves here across the air to is soon page ebony expense or profit loss again and so this is just breaking down from page 32 and as your senior the key the key genesis there 's and things and challenges another area and out the box on the side we 've given the explanations of the high-level explanations of the key key variances here which is predominantly around the income as you can see the expenditures within forty five thousand of budget or pores on that page to see if there 's any questions before we at a high level before we go into the groups of activity the first one being community services three am I don 't you know there 's no the opportunity to have that box with the type in just our for the Tommy of your glasses on our commercial there is any of the blue bread I can read I 'm having difficulty roof I think thank you for that feedback council because all three of us do to win here when you pick up the rapport swing because then you may have noted the one that were presented last month what 's only fixed for the next start meeting some of our elbow geez foot apologies for days yes because I think I 'm glasses as well now that 's okay um I can 't say well if there 's no sorry you know Ben councell here this is pleasing to see the sales a hedge about a upper anything went 36 thousand and it was is it for the deer farming the economies have strengthened obviously hey buddy here it 's good to hear Peavy yep yeah we 've got a growing grass ok I 'll here over to nickel think kasnian counselors community services is the first group of activities what do you see this month is that we have now got our full report sitting in front of you so first page is around your finances for more community services then we go on to talk about the performance measures and what you won 't help are any specific projects related to community services but you 'll see those sitting in other groups of activities as we go through and the recent Illinois projects they 're out because none about a agree with activities focused primarily on our regulatory services so it 's very much service delivery driven he does mentioned earlier when he was discussing his cavalry reported very growth that we 're seeing as a district and you assume that comes through in terms of the finances and particularly that 191 k variation in terms of the fees and charges where we 're on the positive side which is always a nice thing and that 's very much reflective of that development that we sing that surgeon growth in the district so real positive and the open page in terms of silver sterli you 'll see they 're running it eighty-eight percent in terms of the performance measures we relate with that twelve percent we 've not need to release those two performance measures sitting there and unfortunately due to the nature of the way that those two performance measures have been drafted if we failed to deal with one particular instance as we have on those two then that 's going to essentially be a black mark throughout the year so there 's no ability to highlight is that the process issues associated with those two have been identified and addressed by staff so won 't see a repeat of that and because of that we don 't intend to just continue to repeat that same box month after month so now that you 've seen it will will take that away next month but you will notice that little red wedge sitting there little red that we want something pretty sure in their shoes oh yeah so good when do some the other difference that you 've seen this report to the ones that you 've previously seen is that let 's regard to the performance measures will showing you the overall performance in a graph and we 've only pulled out the details for the ones will live not hit the target and that 's very much about letting years government 's focus on the areas where you really need to put your energy and attention so you 'll see that as a parent as we go through the report don 't you write this in regards that the total projects like water transport now move on to them there 's a number of groups of activities that I 'll be talking about and I will just report which through those first as the first up is the world activity and it is just some highlights here if he thinks in terms of budget is taking pretty right and expenditure as just below at the forecaster I 'll just like to read at the stage that these past three or four notes will be targeting leg detection and particularly in touch in advance of the summer months to deal with major leagues that will my love and to try and sort of preserve the Moodle that loser and so that reflect of a net expenditure in terms of any whereas that of capsules of betting the questions that they can ask them as i 'm gong show you rather than right until the end of each activity recent Whitman and Terms of Service performance will Carol modem univera ok glass and hints I the grain cereal and indigo show you an HR for the Q politics both made is a particular team project for designers of fooling a couple of weeks behind with the designer clips and what your I 'm pretty sure that we can get them back on target again we love the other projects show me a hair pretty much on tape and will notice that once your path has got a nice orange button this is a project that 's being on the go for I kept between years and the world layer was up on set we prefer asked and completed a bore found a good volume of oil and the initial tests suggest that aspect level is half what the maximum accept evaluate so if you will clean some of the earlier tissue rolls will grade we were getting values were on excessive that knife and unfortunately that is a moment or entities indicate quite a significant level of iron and manganese so we need to induce and through the floaty string and through the testing of the water just to confirm that those values might look like but we didn 't wear and as converted relatively low acid level at the stage and then that work being following on for that kid mr. Lewis confirm or deny if the Bonjour pipe water supply is not adequate for a variety of reasons that they will have the same opportunity to hook onto the tap o supply is what it 's noon what exactly about confirming your demand and cancel the village I 'm really taking the PIAA CSF sheepishly is is it is a group within our community they 're struggling for an adequate water supply so raise their load be given the same opportunities what it 's no thank you yeah water just a council that the multiple ratepayers Association there grumbling about the decision to do the whirlpool of reservoirs it 's going to be a target of right not happy at all did you try to tell counselor at the time we 've made a decision I see to the ratepayers Gruber 's democracy and this was decided on the day I just want to meet you know that was the feedback from the village thanks boo Sylvia that are operating expenditures to slightly advanced of really fit we obey it 's all with a typically at this time of the year or just prepared as we doing a lot of maintenance activities leading up to the ratios which usually appear and over to seem that you may feel during the summer months and soul of the pre will see inmates activity is undertaken and locally amount of the year in terms of projects and court below has been finished it 's been with hundred are completed CL extension without to KL extension plan and its intended that let go out to tender fairly shortly and turn to page full of tone and see the with other phones footpath that still on toilet we preparing tender documentation at the moment we 've identified an issue with 44 walker point rear and the design was required to include and retiring rooms for some section saying that that wasn 't blood formed original budget and angry we 've been looking at what we can do with it to minimize that costume 80 g is currently at the team that three that you have you sort of got a guesstimate of how much more the stage it is we get the tender courses on rollover well be able to say with some certainty what it look like mr. Chairman I raises questions of someone happened this morning he said I think thought to you mr. Lewis i 'm a bit concerned that the hundred thousand off a few percent funded for milk outside the fact we did this through long-term plan process were there any designs or that particular work way to come up with now that we need another seventy thousand feet speed not quite sure hair however should we addressed we wait to the next long-term claims at the moment are not very happy with proceeding with something that 's so far out of the original budget that was approved if the sponge will don 't know what that 's going to look like i 'm not sure where you 've got the seventy thousand dollars from it shows here and the page 42 that it 's now 170,000 when a factor was 100 wasn 't but for this budget was first Overton 's i believe there was 70 in the first year I 'm giving a lot was approved in the long-term plan it was a whole vision city be approved in the long term care and at this stage we don 't know what welcome of the tender process will be that could result of an additional funding and answer to the question about the link to employ the estimates for a long-term plan so for this project that encodes 21 2015 put together 2030 and we don 't we allow our for detailed design and the long team home leading up to a construction so about stage it 's more of a distant shore and rather than detail estimates will mr. chairman now with the fear the developments going on out in that area is a prudent for us to put this on hold until we see what the requirements are the fear the development and the development of secure through the atom atom my terms of for yoga level side of the odds are they of these stand side of Lake to us I moves provision whether we 're for footpath sell md advantage what this footpath is on the opposite side of like terms so the provision of it for that other footpath was that already in long-term plan so just envision say this this path was the mountain man you 've really made a decision that you 're going to continue on with it what I 'd say is that most sources indicating is that is potential that the tender when it comes in maybe maybe over there that 's when with another opportunity to reassess do you wish to spend the extra money or not at their time at this morning we simply don 't know that Kingdom might come in and it a whole lot under their budget we don 't know until market tells us what the value was at the moment you do have a resolution saying we shall do the project and you can change that once you know how such the markings willing to gonna cost of construction okay so it 's not set in concrete even though it 's been approved that 's all you can see if more if it came in under budget they might be signing up under my delegation budget then the then a is to come back to you for approval for the unbunch of the component and that 's when you would be a key opportunity to say actually we don 't want to spend that thank you community service and community facilities are tracking pretty much on target so just go makes it communities so that 's things like libraries at ginny 's museum Great Lakes Intel please James has an for the elderly toilets and symmetry so covers a wide range of stuff parks and reserves and absolute taking on budget terms of operational expenditure and they 've still got some capital expenditure program for the second half of the year majority of the cubital budget is and removes of buildings parks reserves if you 've got any detail Christians are gonna yesterday then what mr. so the chair most um Bay wasn 't here is that because that subject was that if I go yet that 's totally prices least be in here no this one the children 's episode interrupt could have just converts the business on transporting this footpath getting something clarified is at sixteen seventeen hundred and seventy thousand and yet the annual plain budget out of the annual plain States 100,000 hits my question about the 77 you 've got as the end plan for a one-year 200 yeah therefore that had 70,000 best one so yeah we didn 't spend that obviously so we carry a forward and the two together these 170 total project cost has always been budgeted at 170 but over two years this year finishes on the CD 2 jun 17 carried the 70,000 forward we didn 't speak thank you yeah I am at the moment icky community facilities if you have a look at service forever and again we some sort of situation and is mentioned earlier customer satisfaction service to other measures having been made and that will stay with us for the rest of the year so we 'll be recording of us once and then removing it from further future report where 's well again expenditure I paired expenditures tracking and to slow down we were forecast so far this year whether he attended an array of those will dispense we 've done over the last 12 yarding notes will circle failing networks which is improved it significantly and nothing out of the ordinary with the expedition for us where we also maybe know how to perceive of our service delivery targets and in terms of projects that we attention to the two of us will trailer park which is when we had previously we were working with Department internal affairs to get material from dredging to enable us to build a pond they had some difficulty with that last summer and so the ab project has put on hold until we get more material which I understand is happening this summer from do i and the canal place would a disposal field and was being some delays iam we 've finalized or moving to finalizing the design name through the considering policies will now require to go out and consult with those people late submitted to our original consider so the best if you don 't keep trekking pole at repeating pain and you may to see that we are hiring done by and capital expenditure by which relating at the moon foam and if you see on to page 49 that project is underway they 've been working out the National Guard a month and it shall be finished in a couple of months time I 'm service delivered a gang we are unlikely to meet our target just over 21,000 tons and primarily due to taking bio solids from our vows water treatment plant in just increased an activity and bathing sector we were giving a lot of construction material can enter the landfill through the cheer I 've got the questions about solid waste if I may um just in terms of the femur really composting and a few months back I I think I raised with mr. green that there was a potential for some government funding there is the solid waste minimization fund did real progress and application through there yes we load them to the application applications reform initiatives and very composting because it 's already account a telly wasn 't we 're going to be able to argue think if we were able to and do some theater work will not be operation that would then make rape rape subsidy and that 's what we 're looking at your your call because I think it 's something with exploring in the future and my last question was just about the 80s our missions trading I know that there 's been some changes there do we understand what implications that might have on our operational costs with the unit charge is changing they 're going to go up aren 't they just is there something we need to be aware of your the market itself as move significantly ask them so you 're the currently trading easiest indeed users are currently trading around 18 and so they they were down down as low as 250 or something like that so yes in the 17 18 plan there will be significant increase in ETS charges coming through that 's out of our control obviously it 's Marta through thank you want to watch for right thank you but still mera dil notice tracking very much according to barge in terms of operation expenditure service delivery again made a meal of our KPIs in terms it went viral parts they 've been installed and the tinder documentation was currently up for quality improvement device at the end of war poetry observe those tingles will be closing shortly ma Christine planning 's got a young nasty little bit there about thirty percent of the performance measures in terms of that service delivery and not being meet unfortunately you only have ability to change their nets because about team also a ten of the following performance measures in this area relate directly back to the satisfaction survey that we do every three years so will appear here is the legacy from last survey 14 15 and the good news is that no room in our be survey is intended to be undertaken to the first power of 2017 so we 'll get a new set of results which will allow us to update these graphs in terms of projects but the flavors of one you only we had a discussion through a workshop both have blue recently about progress there and within having some discussion with the y que regional council around co-funding some of the investigation well and we 've got some field discussion coming up shortly which is suggesting that we made you have to cut some of those costs down for the 17 18 years so it 's that 's moving positively I just over the page the Tory reserve management plan I believe developing in conjunction with natatorium ticaret is going very well inside here there brother so Genesis as we gathered some momentum on that project but somebody fair to say that the teams working very strongly with know who Turing tooker now and we 're getting some excellent results back so we 're looking forward to it progressing and recently fast um the only other commenters going to make is around the signature last one there we 've got the big traffic-light we notice the traffic by Lord teach me going out for consultation over summer we 've just been having some internal discussion around the timing of that there 's the submission is being raised about parking on booms and there 's an intention to discuss those with the free committee early in 2017 given the potential for that by around the boom issues we think it 's probably wise for us to just hold off wait till we 've had that discussion with the Fred committee and then we can proceed with that by little change if necessary so just a slight delay while we 're young look at the potential to include about I 'm just through the chair and I just on behalf of bike taupe or how confident are you with your expectation that the walking and cycling strategy will commence an early 2017 we 've got some resourcing challenges or before the sale will remove definitely stretched the team in the first half of this financial year however we 've got some money set aside to engage your consultant to help project manage that the big advantage of having a consultant is you can drive them very hard and they 've got the ability to call an additional resources as and when required which we don 't necessarily have so we 'll definitely stay in touch with regard to that and I 'm confident that we 'll be able to have a full draft completed obviously something we 'll need to stay in touch on yes and because it was programmed that this policy would be done in the 2016-17 financial year yes so here just need to keep pushing me and unfortunately yeah definitely for the kid just thank you Miss dippity min hey the bottom of page 54 armor today at another community board should counselor ki will agree with me that the world is taking a pre proactive take on it 's taking a pretty to creative stance on what we 'd like to achieve over the next three years and we 've got some fantastic goals and projects within focused on once again what as always to cornelia into tina for the help there but we look forward to our first workshop on that one and some really cool stuff going to come out of the community board right the investment activity there so putting those and it 'll bring your attention to us and the explanations on the young spacious 5 on the right hand side there so you can see there 's some additional reading you coming through in from runs and sundry income some additional findings rivoli interest income and then some accounting stuff in terms of marked market on foreign exchange yeah both up and down going to the next page you 'll see that in terms of the service delivery and everything is 100 seen on track as per the LTP in vector connect not much to add in terms of economic development sorry will have had your workshop this morning I expect around the section 17 airy work that 's being done going forward I think that offers some real potential in terms of looking the way we conduct our business and I 'm certainly looking forward to seeing the results come out of that what that work may also assist us to do is a bit of a refresh of our performance measures you 'll see that some the performance measures that we 've currently got in the LTP I very much about measuring our performance against how the rest of that country 's going and dissimilar question marks internally about that 's an appropriate way to measure performance particularly given that as a can pull to change this performance so it 's certainly something that we 're focusing on as we look forward to in annex long-term plane I mean in again no specific projects sitting underneath the economic development see live activities I 'm just a question through the chair please probably more to to a mr. green when we and looked at the section 17 review earlier this morning we talked about the list the scope of it is it appropriate to consider the way we handle our land sales in the way we approach that work under that section 17 review as well or is that a separate piece just at the question thought came to me as we were going through this today it seems included there today okay its just oh sister food for Thornton thank you sorry do you are no matter we use syrtis I know my let 's face it i did notice you may be sure Nick about how we are we comparing ourselves with the right and the right for the right Carlo entities by notice that every single one I was on they 've got one that we would rather come close to be fear and I know we SAT upon been the province we 're in the provinces where as a lot us has be driven by the engines of Auckland and Christchurch and Wellington to a degree and I don 't know much about the stuff to be fear what you guys do in the background but maybe we need to be comparing ourselves in the provincial basis with other districts which have small populations now the main centres which had the same sort of little engines are drive then I don 't think it 's a seraph air by the same time I don 't want to see us low in the bar just because we 're falling behind that made it move do two sets and measures one with provinces in one overall I don 't know maybe that 's the way forward to make sense here again something that seemed in a review will probably get to colleges here so that it be meaningful you know something out learn the value of riders but at the moment arms here when you 're ready okay good binder phone we are small provinces in etc it 's actually not telling you much you know it 's not giving you their indication of how we are you going out video I think yeah what we talked about before that I 'm rebuilding consensus intricate more relevant scary moment for me about how the economy is going so so that that 's a real challenge and then you 'll think Meg 32 when you see my cape the eyes of John responsible delivering the film additional delivery model I can 't deliver this for you you know it 's outside of my control so we need to think about how we do that to page fifteen monday the treasury report so the first page there is the Oval summary of the treasury report so you 'll see there the investments section we have the tech related thing to point out there as well as of the OCR is at 175 so it 's a you know the lower set will think we 've seen a new zealand and so it 's in cash investments now our bones 148 and the you 'll see there in the telefund how in terms of the performance on the return sits down and it 's again primarily because of that the interest remaining the round ones because we have a very conservative fund over to page 16 so this is what the investment portfolio side of it here is more around our working capital funds so you will see that within compliance indeed the graph of the top right there with all the rent bars that 's just showing you how the how to effectively those term deposits short-term cash deposits I kept short to cover working capital and cash flow so that we can pay the bills as we go on through the year so we effectively just keep that cash at a fairly short current rate to pay the twist whereas come tell them they 're the virtual cash returns bhavesh in both cash returns and the yield percentages both actually ahead of hit a target there and predominantly us because we 've got a little bit more investment cash around you 'll notes there flicking over the page 61 figure you will see the our bowling works here where will well within those the funding and liquidity risk position that 's on the right hand top box bar graph again that 's that liquidity is very important to us and showing that we 've got funding in place to cover us going going forward and people keep lending this money so and you 'll see the supplements there I 'm showing how this tricky so it 's all good positive interest rate performance position will see that our interest costs a slightly ahead of budget dear so it 's but by new year that could come about right off them page 62 so page 62 is the is the telefund you will see that the the allocation of that fund there is predominantly in fixed interest can be sitting at seventy-five percent and then you 'll see the performance on door basis we 're slightly ahead on a dollar basis for run for the NL annual returns but on a percentage yield basis were a little bit below and the explanation is performance so there isn 't where we head on the dollars that we 've got some capital gains on some equity transactions so the dollars wise who lookin pretty good there in page 63 that 's just can party could exposure so what there 's some basically telling us that we 're investing more boring from worthy credit counterparty exposures companies or banks of that have a high credit rating basically so not dealing with bungie outfits or suppose some point and it 's a treasure report the christians on that kinda element will say to be happy to answer just a quick question to the chair for no fee mr. word and we 're projecting a no real yield for 1617 of about just under four percent for TL fund but you 're signaling there that we may fall short there how significant without that day for us to fall short what sort of dollars that we 're talking here I don 't think it 's going to be significant because on the other side of the ledger charges are we going to be paying less interest on our I know we don 't have his higher level of exposure to shears as we probably should that term that those that we have we start to see some positive gains on and just stem at with the treasury management report one of the counterparties it sees much of a power but would it not be weary New Zealand yes we should change it thank you yeah the questions right okay do we have a loser I 'm just suited she I just wanted to make a comment what was just a little bit of feedback and I guess it was for mr. green regarding we sent some of our staff down to Kokua area I 'm recently and I 've just had the opportunity of

    "text": "all right item 4.3 back to you mr. Louis is the resolution is it empirically is they can marry and capsule and receive in the ginger item regarding electric vehicle charges and star forest i 'm seeking out expressions of interest that was done received more expressions of interest of which authorized 94 were actually interested in and supplying in and stalling charges into the up to a maximum of two car parks and in the report will identify over the four wheeler with our preferred supplier being charged need are we take any questions at the stage it 's counselor park at least thank you and you wish it on page 25 and are the options and with disadvantages of it things and offered to charge Dickens 's may not have community support what does meet by their what this meaning is that if it doesn 't Percy so if it was offered to irrespective of who it was any supplier then they may not be community support for the loss of the cut the car parks for EV chargers our bright sides about that a motivation around okay your thumb with charge neat I see they have a network of stations does that mean if there are any issues that fit as someone based around like and rush rule because I 'm noticing like couple of local companies also showed some interest and but I just yeah just want to be reassured that if we 're not using a local company and even though this one obviously does have experience that if they were issues they have someone accessible to our site the closest avoiding the areas for tottenham is just a bias establishing an ocean road network I think Tara Mae pure and where we are the closest sets that whether they 've got another item by seven levels i 'm not too sure when we were just recharge stations I think it 's great to see us moving fooled in the space in the other yes thank you it so happy just a couple of questions for me Dennis do we know how many existing charging stations we have in town no we 're down about balloons there 's one charging station at the present time 'm assuming that these people will be charging people to use the station yes screw k i 'm a recharging them or going to have a license to occupy or deceive the public space your lessons talking Paula brought to calendar to serve with a violent charge anything for them ok I just I just wonder about the philosophy of that would just like to not understand what counselors use around the swim out on there and the out last one was just F these am stations are not well used um do we have a point in the contract where we say they 're to come down will be removed if they 're not being am I guess used we can shoot including the oceans to work importance it 's just you know we are hopeful that they will be used but I just wouldn 't like to see them gathering dust theorem find with less car parks and they 're not being used to approve this charge need for any other providers today and let us know what they are so that then you can put onto the stage all we 've done is going out and test the market and the recommendation as charged nikka venir the National City but really it 's up to you to identify now what on what grounds q and Ellen on the others that new activity we haven 't_''_258.37 allowed it on council lamp before so it 's do you want to accommodate it enough so under what terms okay my perspective I 'd be quite interesting us exploring whether we had a license to occupy as part of that agreement charging yeah charging something well I mean we charge our local cafes and bars and restaurants to put tables out on and cheers out on pavements would we not have the same philosophy for a charging station just up for discussion any other thoughts on that I think that Thomas à choux trigger point that it 's a commercial activity means the day they 're making money out of it so we 'll be supportive as part of the new technologies and embracing the future but I think it should be a charge for that my question was on their and topo in the first quarter of next year and toefl wondered is ever got two sides of a it 's wishful thinking I 'm going to get this I 'm one of the advantages with charge meters that you can have an account with them and though have you can put on your keyring something like that and you just swipe up and your charge goes through so because it 's the advantage of having our nationwide network what timely energy have the same thing in Turangi in other places with your unmanned petrol stations and they 're paying ground rent to people for it so much they need to follow through on that we don 't even think of that residents at the point just through the cheerio because quote I 'm not close to whether we should have a license dr. pol or not but I 'd be quite absurd to see what other councils do because I mean one of the things about us is free parking and accommodating everybody so we should be accommodating electric like we do mobility and everything else I think and what the other and sort of councils and the areas that charge network with what they do yes because we want to be similar wouldn 't we yes but I don 't think we should treat electric car in space is any different from mobility or 60 minute 120 days doesn 't just car parking this is about a charge it so it 's probably more into a petrol station then I come home yes yes but I 'd still like to know what other counselors staying look that another council deserve this is wider range one you can think of from full commercial REIT essentially through to you free of charge giving a community benefit so so there is the the range some councils allow on Street some of our off street some of our one company some open it up to any companies you could infect approval for yea which would be up to a car parks and you could have them all set in there but whether or not they would actually want to be next to their competitors there 's another story but you know that work with there 's no right or wrong answer the council so he said there 's an unknown technology of the stage unless something is evolving timid could engage the question though in this first came for council some time ago arrays word that we were going to am beginner G providers to delivery respond or didn 't you go to them when you see that expressions of interest expressions of engines were publicly at the torch for both the world through the the gates of 19 de one of those muscles of energy support I 'm not aware of any of the others that are energy supplier Sigma matrix were working with Victor think we also need to supply our just think about this need to the VP 's and start development responded i 'll accept it just one of the questions that cancer jones has raised whether this should be tabled into regular further information or we make our decisions what we going to charge not charge to charge or not if you wish to charge in the right meet consumer version of that the things that we thousands of years we do that on evaluation basis what if there 's basically activity which would be in a normal way they counsel on today 's business so if you think wishes do you want them then if so which company in how many car parks and of some wonder what Tim said you want to charge my concern at the moment is that is the car park issue we continually get hand with taken care packs from the central CBD this is another exercise with more ago whether it 's good or bad I can open it appears to be in an area where it 's not hi there is there was the reason that you picked initially and asked us to look at their site those fundamental reasons one was that is a transformer right there for severe simply require a lot of electricity your names have performance or Myrna close proximity and is when I met facility the second issue as they barely under most underperforming car park off street car park on the CBD at moment I think the photo to show you that yeah time favorite places but reverse racism and it is our most underutilized which is why you initially asked us for this so I think I 'm happy enough that it 's a viable proposition it 's just a matter of the charging isn 't it so and just so the chair just another thought to is the length of the license to occupy in case we had some alternative uses for that land in the future I mean I quite like the location because you can walk into town and you can walk everywhere so it 's quite pragmatic solution but I wouldn 't want to lock us in too long it 's just another thought for the table if you have happy remove the recommendation but without amendments that guys talking about that subject of finalization of them yep please hmm can we do it as a like that yep so you 're happy to move them motion the changes do we have a second doc I 'll see you net all those in favor I carried

    "text": "item four points to clinical Heights construction and cons good afternoon change em up I love good afternoon councils I was leading in with Gemma 's homes on their peers eye candy and well I I guessed in terms of a summary for this particular item it 's to do with our botanical heights subdivision which must be real wrong we have made significant progress in regards to sages 3b and 3c with is for the report 14 contracts in place since that time we 've got another couple of sound purchase agreements out with and parties for a be reviewing and hopefully return a new future and to further interested parties who are looking at a couple more of their i guess what would be for it so with that in mind with that the opportunity to continue and do this even future lots which is the end of this subdivision skimp on which is 39 lots and due to the timing obviously being your head over we were hoping officer predictor my guess is the best way to look at it we 've requested their funding for the go ahead and infra mix because they 're on site at the moment constructing we 've proposed that we extend the contract with them to continue with the rest of the subdivision and hopefully get less disruption for noticin year by having the construction hit them concurrently with the three beams three see that 's on at the moment so if there 's any further questions I 'm happy to answer them that 's our cousins pretty cheer thank you for that firstly when I start to say I 'm flesh and friends are more important a section through council say you in really really well so I see a secret shopper possible about some questions what I modasa title maybe but what were the two figures in there was one 59 61 358 verified it was three ok cancel howdy sir the way they dispatch office information struction cost is the 358 thousand dollars so it 's the contract that we need to extend in the 596 is their total round and figure including development contributions and all the other elements that come along with the construction so so yet my question will be s about Monty a caper site including GST is a bit high for the industry norm yeah it 's relatively comparative terror stage 3a which was around about that the reason being because of how it 's structured in the way in which 16 so the road is going up that 's the top of the go-ahead between botanical gardens and what we 'll build a gallery to the north of it in there for these no sections that come off the advantage so in terms of the subdivision we 've just done we held sections that came off right away which is less expensive than the extension of the road so it 's basically centers around roading infrastructure then they from now yep so then just to clarify because they 've got very confused not configured in a while but we 've riginal e were 38 b and c we we funded an advanced certainly for some pre-development word was d not pilot just going back is it so you 're so strangers 3a and was the construction of all of the earth works so that was the influence a memento but rather than anything else beyond that that was done so he was under caching and the other elements associated with that we 're done as part of 30 in addition to that obviously these being a changing market which we 've noted through the increasing cost for through been saying that compared to 30 and yet so i guess is part of the reflection of the changing costs here so cost to develop these sites is actually more than a hundred KP side so I 'm just what there 's a green but putting us through but he 'll on them I haven 't done the past few a lot but I think I don 't think it 's over 100k and in terms of food around off of the entire throughout earth will do I don 't think it goes over there after the decisions they can keep see me that what they look good is pretty close before this is for more information yeah laughs along z yeah we 're thinking can we get out here yeah I I shall previous stage the throwaway i think it was around 1.2 for for the total construction that the 12 watts so that 's around 100k the original faith and though i think it 's close to three million so i haven 't gotten exists because of course these are the condition complex and price that are still to be confirmed food through all some so that 's not there any other questions are we going to be borrowing money for this yes just right raise the quilters went over we 're borrowing money to complete the subdivision sacred yes we are looking at unbudgeted expenditure but on the basis that the profit from 3 b and c is greater than what would actually budgeted for this year you could say in fact that we using some of you so for some camp what we are talking about was budgeted for next year so we 're looking at bringing up forward because of the market demand and the we 've actually sold those sections a lot quicker than we thought that why we get the construction team they 're doing the riot 're going to take the equipment away and then and then again start again and you 're not against what we 're achieving to do i 'm just wondering why we need to borrow when we 've just heard of profits that we may have or have off the elements already that 's because we treat income separate to expenditure the income is revenue the expenditures capital expenditure so will this cable spin jury will be covered by income yes thank you so do we have a move on a second up several one right fine all those in favor all right I carried _"

month we have only got the financial position you don 't give the service stuff and essentially DSS turf our ministry sets our intentions became the service performance items to you on the first of December council meeting and terms of highlights in my report probably only things i had mentioned leah was the it 's written as the Mafia award and which was a significant award for this district and in that was ordered to the council due to the amount of wood if she wasn 't the council as to the community as a result of all of a good work time that this council has held their award and quite an esteemed ward internationally and the other thing that I 'd highlight there was the completion of the extension to the White i know a five mile Bay wastewater treatment plan pipeline which is obviously a major piece of work that the last council signed off I think probably about three or four years ago now so so nice to get that one under the belt and I 've got the team in front of us here as you 'll see who will be the team that will normally walk you through the reports as I say this one is primarily financial so I imagine any questions that you 've got pretty much go to kneel and the runs pointing that way and you know we do have the team here so if there are any other questions about any other projects or silver standard matters that we obviously haven 't reported to you please feel free to raise them an order our visitor to answer three amigos amigos all rights and a roof year so whatever something repeated page 'm not concerned about that given the economic financial situation but I am interested in your alternative investment strategy which you actually approval then using steers to where you are like obviously William straights pests increase the good business did you we 've whoops we 've increased our exposure to equities to about tour percent-- two-and-a-half and you 'll see that on our year today performance we 've got a unrealized gain just in this financial year about half a million dollars on that we are still struggling as far as finding any corporate paper for long-term investments the market 's pretty sensitive as you saw with bricks up you also saw at the thirty fifteen two days before the Australian election ouch is right down and god only knows what 's gonna happen tomorrow might be trumped as it stands we are heading by no choice for own but to keep fun short and increase in equities is pretty much driven by dividend yield what we 've done is is for each of our equities at the time of purchase we have agreed on an exit price so we and looking at gains with you know when could make a ten percent return in a short period of time then we 'll take it they give us an interview of my complete confidence can I just ask the reason for buying more equities but we 're we 're what was their percentage exposure to equities before well it 's been fluctuating Lee and since 34 tuned we sold a parcel of shears that as a to as at the end of January we were losing 430,000 on those shares and we made ten percent profit so it 's just a matter of fluctuating exposure so exposure actually dropped down to that seven percent and son Sam report oakland airport sydney airport and APA which is an energy company and so we 've gone from seven percent 212 C cancer cousins I noticed on page 61 FR is a 148 million looking at on local government placed in the top take the article is on the war used to be the web government go in there without rise up to run home to see their gross will need it and they have white use to financial governments around the yes so but if they 'd like to grow still need debt to turn up soon I just want to want clarity on new inscription must be there must be neater what we 're about to let some privacy freedom all right good me 30 60 or 80 thank you okay XS are young fun four questions in moles thanks my style is that yeah so what for I want to briefly and I 'll soak my pencil yeah and so all be done anything with listen to more of a combination of a horrible graphical presentation business or a member so try to make people understand I always tell us that accounting is a sexy profession and I 'm sure about that for so what we have is basically the profit and loss statements on page for you out there so across the top box rights review plus you 're operating revenue this shell operating expenditure equals you need for profit surplus very good service just more pretty standard sup so it 's quickly walking through the boxes here what system and then tubes if you bring your monitors your it 's just to give you the high little capture ideas even think should be concerned about you 'll see in the Greens under X revenue 0.1 favorable see it across the page there that just tell you and we were tracking in terms of budget against those high level categories you 've been dropped down to the control officers below that 's just a breakdown of the ninety two point five million operating expenditure in framing that down into four key elements which is your personal cost depreciation finance costs and other expenses see there in appreciation one spot because marginally marginally unfavorable forecast that 's in overall we 're actually 1.2 favorable editor satima caught up in terms of sitting below those boxes there is what we 've done is we 've broken the operating revenues and your own expansion beyond by the group 's activities that are in the long term plans they usually for approach auto community services great sports etc and it 's just giving you a high-level victoria l 've you of how we other and you operating expenditure so get a snapshot hopefully that 's giving you a reasonably overall picture unique any questions around that so your finance costs a cost you more I 'm just trying to get them in the separate mother ma mosey more says three so that 's what 's unfavorable okay yep yep can Sigma Christine sorry ask do we have a savings program do we look operationally at every area and set ourselves a target every year of reductions um so we do so so it 's a continual program and I 'll speak more about that as you as you get under the under the table more but but yes we do in each year we all do an annual clan which shows you the breakdown of what we 're spending we 're and we obviously a lot of their their savings are determined on your levels of service that you want to provide there are things within let that is an organization we do which which will serve up to you in terms of some of those savings but it 's a continual program the last couple years with all the last view badges half million that we came up that what one of the things that you may have seen in other areas and it 's something that I don 't support los cinco bailey is some organizations have affected in the said we will find x million dollars for the savings and we 'll factor that into budget now and then when you roll through if you don 't achieve that that can lead you in some quite challenging financial circumstances as i have seen that gun and other yesterday 's we prefer the veteran real savings and go through their place i 'm not quite sure whether that yeah i mean a lot of other organizations do just what you said you don 't like dying but but i just want to know it 's a rigorous process because there are always huge savings and the operation of any organization or business and if you don 't push yourself to find them you won 't find them and it just it wasn 't clear here whether you do that or not some of the processes we do a glass wall is implant we get a team of our team of we play on team of us safe through 40 meetings before relying Boylan on all of their budgets become an ominous for all the incisions are so and use i can assure you that process is ongoing process we just we continually reviewing what we do in seeing whether or not we can for example invest and capital turn to reduce operational costs whether or not you know fleet management as an example is one that we 're looking at the moment how do we do that can we do that better can that reduce our demands on vehicles just as an example so it 's a continual thing that we we pick off opportunities as we see them and I 'd welcome your ideas as well on those so that we can put him through the through the most bitchin I use partners thank you okay next page listen here knockouts cousins watching you on cct on the TV on account okay so turn around this again you double check just give it a test run maybe if I just don 't lean into it just so what what you sound the count here okay okay right so you can 't hear all right it 's better so if thousands of people listen to me always wanted to be famous okay meal and next page 49 I got a page 49 so this is looking work reversible this microphone this is looking or your balance sheet stuff so we 've tried to give you a high level snapshot of where we are in terms of the borrowings the cash obviously in the bones and the capital expenditure program we 're probably going to change the take the traffic lights of this because it 's the traffic lights a little bit meaningless in terms of this report here so for example we shine read on the bowlings we project to get 146 at the end of the year you start a 148 so it 's going to show a read all the way through so it 's kind of meaningless that 's one yes last one year so it 's a the more important thing is we 're the numbers are on that within given you a graph of the breakdown of weirdos borrowings are and you see they 're predominantly among some as you 'd expect amongst water transport and wastewater Dennis 's for he spend all their money so that 's where the majority of their did sets you capable program over see if into the first quarter we 're not really cranking in to that program you just getting the preparatory work done so it 's the phasing automates the straight 12 as opposed to a cash flow so that 's why that 's looking a little bit right there but that will kick and more as we go through the year any gang we 've just given you that broke down boy or the new cables which is new programs the renewals and invite tivity so high level snapshot on these first two pages within out of page 15 that 's more your traditional numbers pnl that you 're looking at there again we 've just given you a couple of graphs down the bottom on the they 're tricking quite visually easy to see there and the thing that should jump out at you there on the revenue griefers their fees and charges are ahead of the head of plan and that 's been driven and we 've given you an explanation box out to the rice men you can see it here that 's been driven mainly by fees and charges and the regulatory area which should be no surprise to anyone and and some other stuff there so that 's and I 'm sorry under in the numbers you 'll see exactly where that sitting the silk wanna make sense to people so far I 'm obviously Ritter 's readers bad black as good as elephant in terms of the businesses just to make it simple needs to be simple for me to understand so that 's how it works those will jump on the page 51 and you 'll see the same format will occur now through the rest of the activities all the poor the group of activities so again we 've done that consistent thing showing you the highly of all there and then what we 'll do is we 'll put some brief explanations of the of the conveniences for each of those group of activities and we 'll have the likes of the condensed and myself up here to to answer any questions on those if anything come poacher out of those certainly when we 've gone through this month stuff we 're going into the first quarter so everything 's looking on track is that is the fundamental message I guess set that we would give so i won 't bore you with going through all of the activities but if there 's anything it 's in there that you wanted to raise please feel free to ask making dinner see any questions everyone like the new layout yes yes easy well thank you for that I don 't know been good so there the end of the financials there and I 'll get men to talk a little bit after i 'll finish this about the what will come in the next report believe the financials then we 've got the standard treasury management report that comes going against the guinness of parameters there and you 'll see that where we 're not achieving a fewer than minutes as allen 's kind of alluded to market conditions we were out on that but that 's full disclosure against the treasury management yeah of our treasury management there so we 'll all the stuffs and we 're funny on treasury management policy fool you still run see how we go any questions anneal straight bored so i looked i may be explained a little bit of that what will be coming in the next month yeah i won 't give you a whole lot of details of any specific healer but what I do want to have a chat about where somehow we 're looking to restructure the report one of the things that um we 've been talking about quite a lot as volunteer the finances and words so traditionally we 've reported to you on how we 're going on the projects that we 've promised through the annual plan and how we goin on our service delivery so those littles of service that we promised plan traditionally we tended to do through a couple of big tables that go over page after page after page and there are they 're probably quite the boys to read and quite painful to put together at times what we 've noticed we 've had a major disconnect between what we 've described to you about that service and their project performance and the actual numbers the finances so particularly when you think about the projects side of things we used to give you a description about how we were going on the project if we would have a project sheet at the back of the report which would again give you a similar description we would have some information around finances on that initial table would have some more sitting on that project she could also have some more financial information about that project setting the capex list of the bag it was very confusing sort of picture that we were presenting so what we 're looking to do is really rational as that give you as we go through each group of activities so stormwater as an today but you 'll also give the cup of projects which we 've got listed in your plan related to stormwater you 'll get the financial information about those projects next to the commentary about how we go in and then underneath that you 'll get the service delivery to do with stormwater so stormwater will all be sitting in one cohesive place and you 'll see the complete story what we 're also really conscious about doing is making sure that the reporting are giving you is targeted on the things that you really need to focus your energy on young talked about the the use of the new color scheme and particularly those traffic lights to really highlight your focus all the other things that really need your time and energy what we 're proposing to do with regard to the service delivery is instead of give you a hundred and twenty-six performance measures which we 've traditionally done month after month we 're going to pull out the ones where we 're not going I 'm quite according to plan and we 'll pull those out will are planning to do to remedy that situation what we found is that most of the hundred and twenty odd performance measures are the same month after month of the month and there 's little to be gained by reporting the same thing month after month after month to you so hopefully by being a lot more targeted we can collectively really focus their energy on fixing the the few little hiccups that will have along the way the other reason that we 've restructured the report in this way is because it provides a much better alignment with the long-term plan in the annual plan any annual report so his government 's you 'll you 're consistently going back to those three key documents as your Bible in terms of how we 're proposing to perform and how we are actually performing so this alignment with your monthly report will hopefully make it a lot easier for you to maintain that oversight yeah thank you all right Dennis you 're okay with everything good man all right um thank you thank you very much I 'm doing the job please for mr. green and healthy rivers plane change with are we proposing a submission collectively with the other councils or are we going to look at doing our own submission probably both so I say yes we are working with other councils to to look at a submission on views of mutual concern or or support it will be some issues which are taupe or specific which the other councils might be interested and submitting on so used to do with this thing out here in the fact that we 're the top of the catchment so we 'll probably need for one and ourselves as well you know i would encourage us to you okay thank you can see jones okay thanks mr. green recommendation on page 47 we received the information chief detective officers report moved by Councillor cousin seconded by Councillor Rankin 's all those in favor please say aye hi links against married _"

Kelly hello Kiwi you think you could potentially be slightly drier than lunch for how much pools taking you counsel of three this is going to to get that this is very much an overview a minus thing you will have received some introductory pics which will contain more detail so if I 'll just go through and I 'll highlight some some points we should I take the item as read I please encourage you if you do have any questions as we quickly go through it to to stop me in and ask the questions now and of course I 'm more than happy after the meeting so the local government act is obviously the the key guiding act for counselors and it provides Council with a degree of flexibility compared with the previous local government act 1974 and that is that the council has what 's called a power of general competence to do whatever it needs to do to achieve its purpose of course that comes with a trade-off it may trade off under the 2,000 into it is that there is a requirement to consult with the community particularly in relation to those decisions which are of significance and I also make the point view that whilst there is a pair of general competence this doesn 't extend to meters of a regulatory nature so when we 're talking about enforcement matters or bylaws for example and the council is very much constrained by the provisions of the local government act so to something to to keep keep their mind there are clearly two purposes of local government the feast is the enabling of community democracy and the second is meeting the needs of communities for infrastructure services in regulatory functions 's those returning counselors in new counselors were no doubt be aware that reference is to delivering outcomes in a way that is most cost-effective for households and businesses and really that emphasis on cost-effectiveness makes affordability which is of course a relative concept to different communities the bottom line for determining how these outcomes are delivered on a page 19 of the agenda item I have highlighted the key principles which a council should have reference to when performing its role and I felt that it was important to highlight these just as the touchstone really for counselors to go back to as they 're performing the role it refers to mirror such as conducting business in an open and transparent in demotte democratically accountable manner the council should make it self-aware and have regard to the views of its communities that should plan effectively for the future management of assets and so on so that 's in section 14 of the local government act so I 'd encourage councillors both continuing and new to continually go back and review those principles so it 's the whistle slept or to which is a bit of a mouthful the local government official information in meetings act or lagrima now the overriding principle of laguna is that information held by council should be made available to the public the idea behind that is is that that will enable more effective participation by the public in actions and decisions of local authorities and promote the accountability of both members and tools to the public let 's see the maybe at times very very good reasons for withholding information and those factors include privacy 's of individuals it can include situations where the council is involved in sensitive commercial negotiations it can include situations we 're and there are some legally privileged material which needs to which there is very good reason withholding it from releasing to the public I 've referred to the are to the interests of the individual and it should be noted the Privacy Act places strict limitations regarding the release of information relating to private individuals and this must be seen as cute alien the general rule regarding the public access to information I just sort of holiday says any information marked public excluded or confidential should not be released to the public or discussed outside of the meeting concerned newest must keep to the rule I mean they cannot choose when to obey rules regarding confidentiality and we need to breach them a constant inconsistent observance of the rules regarding confidentiality is critical to the delivery of good governance to the community and the item goes on to to just encourage members please that if there is a question in their minds about the release of information they hold and to a third party and that that be a query or a quiz shall be referred to the democracy and Community Engagement Manager Tina Jack 's continue and the local authority meetings and confidentiality and when the public is excluded by geo resolution of the council and when the council holds information confidentiality within it is critical that the rules of confidentiality are strictly observed and maintained by the members of the council this is really first by the steering orders which you 've referred to in your declarations today which means that a breach of confidentiality under the local government X so let 's that 's the importance which the local government official information a meeting effect in the local government act are places on confidentiality right moving to the local authorities members interests act 1968 now this helps protect the integrity of local authority decision-making by ensuring that councillors are not affected by personal motives we may participate in council decision making and cannot use the position to obtain preferential access to contracts so these really I think we 'll all agree metres of common sense the Act deals with two thumbs of interest both a peculiar interest and a non-pecuniary interest the distinction is a peculiar interest is more straightforward it really deals with an interest that involves money the more difficult one sometimes can be dealing with non-pecuniary interests and sometimes referred to as is the appearance of bias these rules are brand bias operate not only to ensure that there is no actual bias but also that there is no appearance or possibility of bias and the principle is is we 're all familiar with justice should not only be done but really highlighting its perception is very very important a non peculiar interest is a difficult issue because it often involves matters as the seed of deception and degree the question will lead to consider which has been drawn from case law as this is there to a reasonable fear minded and infirmed observer a real indication of bias on the part of a member of the decision-making body in the sense that they might unfairly regard with favor or disfavor the case of a party to the issue under consideration if there is the members should declare their interest in withdrew from the debate the law of our bias does not put you at risk of personal liability but importantly the validity of the council 's decision could be at risk the need for public confidence in the decision-making process is paramount and perception can be an important factor move on now to the crimes leaked again this is very much common sense under the Crimes Act it is unlawful for an elected member or officer to accept or solicit for themselves or anyone else a gift or award for the council or to use information gained in the course of their duties for viewer or another person 's advantage or monetary gain one of the outcomes of a conviction of the crimes wrecked is there a member would lose their office going on the secret commissions act 19 team again it 's a matter of common sense which should be obvious to all the act basically establishes offences relating to the giver you 'll receive a or soliciting of gifts or other consideration is an inducement or a word for doing it will for billing to do something in relation to the fears of the council or showing or having shown favor or disfavor to any person in relation to the council 's of fears or business again a conviction under the secrets Commission egg will result in the member losing office the financial markets conduct egg 2013 it 's not an act which is relevant at this time to the council because currently this council does not offer securities to the public if it did so being that the members would be in the same position as a going out to the public about the securities that were been offered deland them the members could potentially be liable under that act moving on to the protected disclosures act 2000 or the whistleblower protection as it 's commonly referred to under the sect an employee which includes members of the council by definition who disclose information about a serious wrongdoing by a public sector organisation are protected from civil or criminal liability bet that might otherwise arise from such disclosure and from territory action against against them now these various some requirements that the employee will member in this case would need to follow if seeking protection under that act the council has a protected disclosures policy which was required to be followed if a member or employee was considering trying to seek protection under the XO please have refers to those and I 'm sure that will be covered a new introductory material to Pearson liability of elected members section 43 of the local tech 2002 provides an indie you see by the council for elected means in relation to civil claims that 's both damages and costs the costs arising from successfully defending and criminal action however the local intact does provide for a theoretical personal exposure on the part of liquid members in certain circumstances if the council has incurred a loss due to actions of the council however you will be pleased to know that as a leader you have certain defenses if you can prove that the act or failure which lead to a loss occurred without your knowledge or with your knowledge but against your protest made it or before the time when the loss occurred or contrary to the manner in which you voted on the issue at a meeting or in circumstances were you acted in good faith and relied on information or professional or expert advice given by an offer counsel officer or a professional advisor on matters which you recently believed to Annette Pearson 's competency so this is this plenty of protection for you here moving on to the health and safety at work heck 2015 something has been in the headlines a lot in the last 12 to 18 months in this provided a significant change to the Pike River tragedy yoknow allocates duties on those persons who are in the best position to control risks to health and safety which is appropriate to their role in the workplace one of the significant changes is to introduce a definition of officers which includes any person occupying a position in relation to a business or undertaking that allows that person to exercise significant influence oh the management of the business or undertaking so that would include glueless so whilst movers have a jew diligence obligation is to other officers of the council and there is you 'll be pleased to know an exclusion from liability for elected members and however of course that doesn 't exclude a members obligation to exercise due diligence in the likely lost the public records act 2005 which is to provide a framework to keep central and local government organizations accountable by ensuring records are full and accurate well maintained and accessible in really the key message here is that in the conduct of there are fears elected members may receive information directly for example from constituents and members will need to consider authority record and therefore need to ensure that it 's included in the council 's records so that 's the whistle whistle stop tour of the legislative requirements like everyone 's are still rather hero still awake I think the short messages to the counselors it runs just gotta behave themselves that

    "text": "right item number 4.5 adoption of standing orders and mrs. Tina Jake 's good morning mrs. Jack LaLanne so as 20,000 the city and relies on the local government and New Zealand have been working on a nice that have standing orders for use by local government and those are attached there are a couple of three points that they 've asked us to to consider well as in relation to and the children 's casting boat the second is around or the ability to have audio visual links in third as around a choice between which option would like to choose her emotions in amendments so the recommendation is that the person 's casting vote he does have a cast English she does he have a casting vote which is what the recommendation was from our local government newzealand and the ability to have an audio-visual link i think as certainly something that we want to have an ear for future proofing that ability and in terms of the motions many months our recommendation as options see which reflects the current practice that this council operates under it 's amendment that we received after the agenda was distributed from local government New Zealand and it 's just in relation to option being were there there was a as a change to that so that 's really just for your information okay think he strikes any questions or queries from subjects mr. Julius are doing with somebody three years ago I rates the same assure this particular day in regards of our standing orders of the theater concerns need to be corrected on this if we go to page 20 28 of the agenda it states we have a amendment or two amendments one is the draft tablet District Council standing orders and it we 've been asked to approve Standing Orders are we looking at a draft or the final version so mr. chairman V when when our documents put up to you at some a draft form and when you 've moved the motion that becomes a substantive substantive one piece could we ask the question we did we as a previous counsel or that previous counsel get the draft to go through the reason I raised it 55 pages the new one has 77 so if we set down as a council and gone through that new draft no you haven 't could even go back three years ago when this issue was raised in the legal present the time came into the the chamber and spoke about the review that 's come up and what we 've got before us now and so that victory would have a new one with some changes and I also needed mr. chairman before bring a bit of humor and so I 'm going to refer back to the wise old man of district council Moses Utley is he listening three years ago in this debate that we had counsel heck now at the time said and I 'll read it out word-for-word basically adopt the provisions of standing borders ie the ones that we 've got now at that time which is what I 'm asking for until the new standing orders would come through and that was the suggestion of counsel hickling so I have moved an amendment and I don 't want to go into the changes once again bring up that we as a previous council and the new council have not gone through this draft and maybe things we liken it we don 't like it 's not the Bible it can be amended so I would like to move that we continue with existing standing orders until the public workshop with some other public forum takes placed to go through these news standing orders and now it moves that way other cancers feel about that standing orders I presume is the standard template from woke up in New Zealand that 's great yep so as is the mind of the counselors they want to change the national team plane dogmas there will be some training opportunities as this is quite new they have liked them a new zealand actually haven 't put out the dates for for their training it so there is an opportunity to attend that training to have a look at the standing orders and again at any time the Standing Orders can come back to Council to be to be changed you need 75 percent of those present to change of standing orders that 's the aim of us some terms of local government Zealanders the template for all councils to use yes sir cousins through the cheered so just to confirm the counsel body you 're saying you want go opportunity be able to read or less and discuss them before we adopt them as that 's what you 're saying is you sacred this incoming Council indeed the previous will never have the chance to go through them some months ago and mrs. Jackson may will remember I did get the draft that draft has this new one has things than this one does it so if we 're working on that but as a council we 're not discussing I 'm not saying that event you will look not what local governors in that recommends what I 'm saying is that we stick with existing standing orders until that is done absolutely second if councillors bodies no circling oh it 's going to speak to your agency inspector yes I only thing I 'm quite comfortable with adopting least and in orders your worship it 's a would use it can be Amanda 's as we go through the triennium if that is what we wish but i 'd i 'd feel very comfortable about adopting them today your worship Thank You Kat settling ok the appears to be no Castle Williamson you through the cheery to support their counsel weaklings view it we run it 's we 're just adopting it they 'll jeans the Eclipse Daniels good morning mendon soon big the quest needed here is on the page on the maybe just now to try and discuss those 30 at least three amendments they just don 't see why we retracing by three years we 're looking at this Iranian okay all right appears to be no singing therefore council bodies suggestion so what I 'll do is go to the suggested recommendation the air just straight to the recommendation on for four bar 526 okay the recommendation then move around those adjusters resolution by Councillor heckling seconded by Councillor Williamson all those in favor please say aye is against live and recorded please so how 's the body against record please sleepy thank you very much _"

    "text": "item number three loose extinction and cabbing request for type or bungee right who 's in Nathan mr. Nathan mori afternoon Nathan any people thank you i would think we 're here to discuss the taupo bungy they have asked for a seven year lease extension and also some minor variations to the least document as well as for the carvings we 'll take the first one a seven year lease extension net will take them out to 33 years which is a maximum under the reserves act and they have been granted extensions before so hopefully you 're familiar enough with who they 're on what they do to understand if you want to provide that for them the variations to the lease were just some minor things to clarify the use of the least these facilities and providing public toilets in particular don 't think that that 's probably the role to provide public toilets for for the council so I would like to take that out of the lease and also just to take out an ambiguous clause about providing forty percent of the lease rental for 've been able to enforce or do much with and there 's a little bit of ambiguity and the writing so council would like to take that out there 's been a lot of back and forth discussion between counsel and representatives of the of the bungee it 's not all included in the police report that would be a lot of attachments but here when I came on board and reviewed all the files it was it was all clear what was intended there and probably one of the most interesting things is the carvings we were approached by the taupo bungy nothing but the representatives here today good afternoon oh yes nice on the old sorry I see you so if you have any further questions I 'm sure we 'll be happy to happy to answer any specifics on that yeah sure also that David Brown will go Darren McClatchy and so the ladies insulation by giving yes nice to see ok cool so carvings yep yes and so the carvings that came to us with a proposal the walkway which leads from the collection point up river which is also used as a public walkway for people to get all the way down taka Falls that is a little bit prone to taking and vandalism and they thought if that Commission some carvings view it would reduce that as well as provide a really nice piece of public art for taupo so they have asked mataki brightwell who i think everybody is aware has done the mine bay carvings if you would like to be the artists involved in that and our understanding is that he 's agreed and going through the concept plans here from councils point of view or officers point of view we think it 's probably a reasonable thing to do in it so it 's a nice thing for the community here if we can get it done in the right way and everybody is understanding so you 'll see in the resolution that we think it 's probably appropriate if we do approve it to make it subject to an mou which council approves which will just cover all the fine details and hopefully prevent any misunderstandings in the future what the carvings are about but i 'm sure sonia and the bungee representatives can explain a bit more net if you 'd like a little bit more okay i think perhaps there 's any initial queries on the lease scenario gasser johns thank you your worship just a couple of quick questions for me one was just the point of clarity the resolutions got 20 35 but cargill stinks later for the 33 year extension goes to 37 so which is the correct 2035 there 's a mine miss oh don 't accuse the Lords of making a mistake we went through all of the when all releases assigned 2035 purrs thanks not to 33 years and we can 't cannot go beyond this that way no that 's why I just wanted to make sure that we were working from the right date and I 'm just the second one was about this forty percent of rental going towards the reserve what I 'd like to know what T th 's views are on that because I couldn 't quite get a clear stare from the documents here that but I was interested to know what I mean I 'm sure they can have some if you prefer the impossible if you like me down am i understanding I mean a lot of us was decided before I started working the council so I can only go through the email trail that I found I think as long as it felt that as long as there was an understanding that the intent of that was the council would improve use money to improve the reserve isn 't when it came about because I believe when they took over the space it was probably not and as good a shape as it is now but it 's just not really possible for us to do that much for complaining and third always in taking place have we done maintenance no these well we 're done maintenance times already given what what 's happened over the years is that type of bungie of coming in suggested different projects with near mind worship it covers the forty percent so some councils remember viewing platforms and other proposals that have been put look we spend a whole lot more lately than the forty percent per year maintaining a reserved through mowing lawns and whatnot so that 's where they 're in Baku Bertie comes from and so he says a result of that discussion and in the negotiations which have happened this we are the agreement in principle subject your agreement remove that their requirement but in the same way remove the requirement for the bungee to provide the public toilets which was the quid pro quo then they provides a neutral position but one that hasn 't got a lot of interpretation issues around it I think we subsidize the entire parking facilities and the entrance area with that products then we emission in in the early days so it 's a lot cleaner will be taken out so what you saying yeah and i would like to because that 's a council requests i would like to see that close 28 in the resolution so that it 's inclusive of the resolution that because those down castle request is this will be the only opportunity with we have to adjust list goes for 33 years so the only opportunity we 've got your shin think I nobody also raised the question over cause 24 if you go to three bar one if actually talks about the clause where it states the schools and obliges council to spend up to forty percent if you go to three bar 10 and actually look at your investment by the lease or an ecstasy is where neutrally agree you know I 've taken us up without legal be legal who may wish to make comic that just seemed to be an incorrect statement that the agenda item C is amend versus around April also mr. chairman support cancer Hickling in regards of heading that cause 28 I 've also had a three in the resolution to do because 24 into a mean cause 23 they 're not in the resolution so whether the need to be yielding up and LG 's turns out of the counselors feel more comfortable with it in then we can yeah I would love to move those clauses are included in the resolution region 27-23 uva it was 24 'll stick in it okay all right thank you just before we move on just a cool probably think that it 's to do with the management plan but the top opens we extended the carpod into as you can see that the bonnet on the 3 by 11 you 'll see the green line around the least area but we did expand extend my car park to an extension of the carport but it 's not within the lease agreement but is that to do with the management plan is both urban poor riveting professor this is the original lease area of was set up the green and will have extended I just wondered whether this is the appropriate time we will extend the lease area from we all look into that come back to you yeah okay do we have a look into that but if it means we 've got to review the management plan then leave it as is possible my name is sending for the management claim is that their area is designated for give the inter activities so whether you think that the car part of their lease or whether it provides some wider public benefit you so the request for the lease extension is pertaining to the green is never good yeah and you can see the legs tension of the carpool just a point yeah well we tidying things up that 's okay alright and so on to the carvings and there 's none on the right destroy the chair just to clarify the tth when I 'm making any comments about the clause 23a being removed because they 've got any unintended consequences for you will be a conversation senior okay what thanks to Anderson so it 's good it 's now my favorite discussion we got in the tories at some stage ear so the main point it up today is extending the lease in the cabins yep okay all right calvings and do the gills with her don 't explain are they going to be another iconic tourist attraction like that one day having so not only will they be something for our obvious ly area so we 've already got the pie made afterwards which has come up takano hotel in the museum as well so this is just one part of that sort of quality art trail as well yeah people in obviously of Nathan also the kind of state of the front of the rock places that we 're looking at seven blue stuff yeah basically just okay thank you any other questions er yes on their cabins siding I 'm sure it 'll be anything it 'll be great mmm so there 's a recommended resolution of indeed Nathan you got all that no photo moves yet the government suggests at the recommended resolution has been amended to include lose 20 times and for 3328 those claws us so 12 and then a new three yeah epaulet just a quick thank you so is it something like a live exact translation unnecessary suggested residency mi casa William will discussion all those in favor please say hi each area _"

to just buy the last corner the committee 's report that there 's a lot sitting in it make recommendations and further work that 's required so what they 've decided to leave that one for sitting on the table and considerate urban post video training solutions wonderfully very important recommendation sitting and that report was around two profiles membership misek now you 'll remember on the Joint Committee we 've got Regional Council like ourselves and brown and blue parrot are the two councils and the crown opponent partners and they appoint representatives to a joint committee to proto a lot of funding partner when the project setup and at that point sometime it was decided that they would nominate representatives would then be appointed to the committee by the other members the review process is highlighted that actually it 's timely that their arrangement being reconsidered particularly given the two proton around an equal partner is that the nominating power being changed to meeting the same as the other three mins so that was too forward to the Joint Commission for consideration the crown raised a few concerns around the timing of that process you 'll be well aware that two protos going through a similar process with the crown and here are all sorts of discussions happening the background postcode even the Crown 's used it that they wish to do some further work on this island hands considering the peace timing of this change protein dreams of the terms of reference around you pointed to rodents so as a result what has been recommended by the Joint Committee are a couple of tweaks to the resolutions we have an agenda recommended resolution is one start ovaries here what is now because that learning changes principle is just a subtle change what they picked up is the Crown 's position that they hit the discussion will begin to these terms of resolution to that Stanford agrees that and then carries through to following the 2016 local body elections again we need to remove the so Lynne Reed agrees that following things the reason that second changes be made is it takes some of the time pressure off okies what will be able to do is really really important that millions for in sever this business recently faster overseas thanks easily around to any questions or queries and Nick David sister I just like I 'm John Williamson and I sit on that committee we were privy to be there and there was a large discussion of discussion about where the crown was coming from to enter photo we were part of that discussion to make sure that your photo were happy with this resolution there was a it was a yes this moment to make sure that it all parties we 're happy the crumbs it 's there what they were selling seemed to come out of Muirfield a little bit and we were in quite a taken back but to fight our we are happy with with the way forward at the moment the other thing I want to really stresses the importance of this committee and voted after the elections it is but they are the kamati don 't run below virtual physical group that happens cannot continue and account for over so unless twist the importance of this committee getting set up correctly after the elections I thought I look I think that really does have to happen John thank you can secure the tech yes sir winston to achieve his dogs endorses commence the mania obviously and give a MacLeod to reach the way to read accounts through it would have been a private vid like any common selected I have you as much as Nick must anything out here tell us what he 's done wrong hey thanks Anne yep thanks very much okay counselor John 's look through the cheer thank you in principle so what does that actually mean does that mean that the committee will reconstitute itself as per this resolution or are we just signaling to the crown that we support the change what we 're by proving the words and principal we 're signaling the all the parties to the Joint Committee agree that it is a good idea that we change the way the tomb in principle it 's giving background the time in the space to have those discussions that they feel they need to have with internal legal advice and with the office of treaty settlements to get to a point where very happy the change to the second resolution gives us the time and the space to do that it allows us to reconstitute the committee post the election I the only cut the comment that I would make is I wonder if we should wait I mean I appreciate what I 'm currently how tumors are saying but we 'll need to get our new elected officials own wiki we can run everything by page after the elections ourselves we still got to nominate our elected officials as well so I 'm a little bit struggling to understand why why the rash when there 's other things happening as well that we 're not all completely privy to but it just feels a little bit like before horse what does resolution signals from both WRC and ourselves as an message to the crown along with 24 hour that we partner as part of this joint committee that provides the impetus for the crown to have those internal conversations they need to have all right but it if we don 't then the crown may not have those internal discussions okay all right that helps understand through the truth the chairs and I understand odysseyk know counselor John 's point regarding appointment so tediously Regional Council of this done as soon as remember I believe may be the end of October integral of asking for leases and staff staff with your staff staff have got the timelines that they know that we need to follow and they 'll make sure that there are the agendas now go to move messages to is emotion thing that gets amended I mean that is because the ocean also

    "text": "thank you item number four thanks guys lakefront reserve license concessions Nathan Fillion that 's the lead Yeah right no real a minute yeah so hopefully this is something you guys have considered over the years before so pretty for more familiar with it than I probably am so we 've had a few different applications 241 actually for an extension of an existing activity which is the stand-up paddleboarding in colac and he would like a variation so that that 's recorded under the company that he 's sitting up and not as individual named he still trades it 'll still be the same name that he trades under which is walk on water but he 's just sitting up the company to cover that so it was just like a five year extension there we also had a request for somebody who is a distributor for ebooks to rent our ebooks on the on the lakefront by standing for looking at it is that we had a very similar operation near last year we tried to contact them to see if they were interested in doing that again was also a resolution to allow that same activity to occur before that but that never went ahead so it seems like that is probably a compatible you spare space fish with the amendment to the management plan which came out a few years ago and the last one is for lily 's empanadas who would like to share the location with the steaming bean coffee cutters and when the coffee cart moves off site they move on with a food truck arrangement we don 't think that really fits in as well with the management plan or the use of that area but we 've described at for you guys to make a decision on what do you want to approve that so I 'd like you to make a decision on those three please yes listen you wish you think in open those wear this spring us approval rate that Lulu 's empanadas are their local family being though they on the market you know mostly most weekends and the running Aruba cooperation don 't really set us this Eric an anticompetitive just adding bit more flavor soca speak in support of the application absolutely cancel what if some i just to hear that manage say the coffee cat goes away say five o 'clock and that year the way they described it to us here is an arrangement between the table or i think they have approached them informally and it seems like something that they both agree to in a way and there 's some details to be hashed out but it 's no point going too far unless I can get the agreement accounts about yes the steaming bean coffee cat would move off site and then the empanadas would moves on site for a few hours I know it 's still be the same take up the same space it would just be a different a slightly different activity mmm you know I had support that you worship because we 've done a similar sort of thing with the ice cream vendor and we allowed mr. whippy to to go when they was not operating so similar scenario really providing the coffee of people a lot of comfortable with them using the site after subject to subject sochi end up in glass yeah okay yeah cancer jamas um through the cheer a lot of agreeing today i agree i agree as well and would like to support it i noticed when you drive down that road though you know you 've got to car parking bays you with a steaming and then the next one up heading towards for a walker it 's actually got yellow lines for pack locked out lines as well could they not take one of the bays each that 's the gelato gelato yeah so mr. wicker goes in new one well as the roadies manage about me to prom is a better idea than ideal like that just adds a bit of flavor no I have to find mark yeah we 've got something that you can pinterest anywhere else like you know being the actual item of food as long as we restrict it to them today in particular recording for that Helen Louise he takes one of them yeah it 's Bernard well they call him any pronounced something added and see which I am sorry quite a trendy little care of into so then we 're pro-business um we physically are indeed I think it 's a great idea um what term would you be looking at because we didn 't not mentioned here what were they looking for Sam I suggest as we 've props just trail this summer and just see how it works yeah okay so dear the moment for the management plan earlier licenses for up to six months so you could offer a six-month term over the summer and see her twin hey guys on the basis that they 've clean up after them and take your brush away lady mm absolutely post retracted so I think yes so there 's a 1-under so one of those who were happier those that walk on water that sounds good you know to tell you is can I just ask at the five-year extension seems to be quite a lengthy amount of time as it normal practice so on the lakefront under the management plan there are seven or eight specified areas and that 's in one of those zeros in there to the five years so this is going to be his last season and here were just like assurance of tenure so can invest in it and the least can be up to five years for each of those seven locations and the specified activities know that this runs over from and the end of oh I 've got it here so you 're right it 's fine things so is Rebecca that 's the ebikes in chapel there yes well we had the bikes last you that was surprising that or not yep it 's not coming back is she so yeah there was no response from the Colossus of this in number three they will change that round to approve a six-month the many mean subject to an arrangement with steaming bean some words around there well it might be for so many months to have put a start and finish date first and over to the sea foods that they put something like that so they know they have to be in the rehabilitation be part of the lease or sell Nikki all

    "text": "alright go to item number 13 closed amendments to the grants in action policy 2015 you know so this is brought to you at priests from wire and Community Trust I wanted Council to review a couple of areas in terms of the grants and partnerships policy and so excuse me one of them was around criteria for salaries and had been a number of comments from users effort by our house that this was would prove quite difficult as most of those organizations were reliant on on salaries so the request from beam as that consider putting in a transition force to align with we that when we look at the new partnership agreement and in those organizations can apply up the long term plan to that partnership agreement and for their ongoing ongoing salaries and the second one was just in relation to the open forums and again wanting to align that with the LTP 2018 but I think about as i stated there we 've already started this money a year and some organizations have already done that open forum process so i don 't believe that already start a bit thank you yoki cancer pack and yes thank you i 'm actually quite happy and to move this recommended resolution i 've spent time with neighborhood support at least social a couple of times in the last couple of weeks and they 're sort of quite hamstrung on what they were going to do in under a bit of misinformation about where they could go and I just think for substantial community groups that do such a great job and I mean they run a 53 k a year and have over 540 volunteers that was sort of i think we 've sort of got an obligation to keep those sort of networks going so on that basis i 'm happy to move it out through the chair to speak to this in support of the recommendation as well having talked to some of the wire house tenants and also to some of the organizations that are in our community delivering vital services such as the one that counselor park has mentioned they are relying on the grants in terms of wages and salaries and it is when they come back to the partnership arrangement so I I would support this resolution as well all right we moved you happy to second that cancer John 's yes yep we 've moved on signal Thank You Tina appreciate that and thank you for bringing in to us and those in favor say aye Carrie _"

    "text": "item number 10 mr. green thank you your worship even though mr. Lewis has been sitting in the hot seat of half a mind to ask him to proceed my report as well but all right um obviously this month has been it 's been a couple of major issues for us one was the snow event at Atlanta que planes a couple of weeks ago and I think it 's fair to say that the ravine wasn 't unexpected at the time but but the severity of it or we talked a few people by surprise so interrupt me again we have a risen from the rain stick mega turkey the sorry your name just excuse me Justine christina is just tell us quickly what you 're doing Christina she 's a obviously large farming organization a years-long and with christina sighs the field yeah what are you you 're doing a study for New Zealand coven okay sorry sorry to note no no problem Kristina 's obvious there isn 't a nice to see have you got the power back on Christian songs Italy okay all right hopefully see okay so you obviously there to be was was quite significant for us and religious management team and in others would quite quite closely with other providers such as unison on that event I think need to acknowledge unison they didn 't go out of their way in here we 're very hard through that process to try and get power Tim P power back to as many people as quickly as possible I 'm obviously with the assistance of counsel officers and so that was was a significant event for us we had civil road closures another other issues as well over there working and following on from there um and we have to obviously have a lot North Head their issues in terms of water supply which has been been hot on the news that is still when the process of being investigated as to the exact cause of that we have had our engineering team rocket our water supplies to give us some sense of of comfort that the same sort of thing can 't_''_149.0 happen here I mean I can you know that all of stop the same thing occurring that here that occurred and havelock north there are a few my little things which we 're working on and I guess this is a another example of projects like the wait i know a water supply that you approved with the annual plan the reason why we put the sort of project forwarded to buy the drinking water standards is to avoid just the sort of thing happening that 's happened and havelock north unfortunately and it will be a place to keep watching over the coming months as the investigation that the government has commissioned in conjunction with Hastings district continues I think it 's for you to say that the timing was rather was a rather unfortunate you never want the sort of thing to happen but the timing alongside the local government reform bill was unfortunate I 'm given the the focus of their bill talking through council controlled organizations and the abilities of council to provide safe drinking water so watch this space in it see what comes out of out of that investigation and the last comment the in 've made a point there about some issues that we 've seen down a spa park in terms of some mangy social behavior which we are working on with increased patrols em CCTV camera footage and other net was terminal I 'll take the reporters read their amok see the service report follows in the financials and for the team here who can answer any specific questions that you may have on any of those modules okay thanks thank you mystery any questions on the screen even though there 's about occupations degree in it 's this report like the project capital expenditure to the end of June yes just that ask the question when I was going through the and it may well have been taken care of as completed job let 's go into the capital expenditure projects a number that would head up to the last lacuna which I think was in June contain things such as panchal power water etc a lot of them have gone I 'm wondering whether they 're being completed because I thought they might have rolled over to the shear ok probably answered you wrong on that last question if you look at page 10 under summary he don 't strengthen this right so I 'm so this covers the period the first period under the new annual plan through to July into July so it 's that first month so the projects that had been completed a new their previous and your fam period won 't be appearing on a food report mantra parka still sticking out there in that one the bow wave is still being determined and the bow wave killer logics will form part of that so the bear wave beanie and complete projects or some of them haven 't even started will appear in the future ones why should we get through the year end Thank You sirs yes I just see and I just send em that the smoke-free signage for playground sirs come off it big completed great thank you cheer system on page 10 bar sex we 've got on the wastewater will fit on your quest water on hold is your time frame for that unfortunately we don 't have at that out of that takano channel and will rely on time when that dredging can take place we 're expecting it to be this summer that the that we haven 't asked will continue with our project and then once we get than the material then we can move forward with our project HTM by 12 which about my sins things I know there 's a new health food outcome of that like how weak open now a weekend where lock block licenses Alice Alice months realism um yes we we 've been down on resourcing so we 've tapped on and so do some external parties to assist our resourcing will soon be up to speed but I said we 'll continue using the external resource until we had everything comfortable that all the premises have been up we licensed page 10 x 18 and correctly from the wrong that 's weevil take gtech out now because Michael G take any more a year a lot less its medical maybe I 'm read it wrong a team about 20 under community facilities it said at least 50 small in the five minutes in July which is year-to-date equals four ETA equals five I understand that that 's their year to date is only target so if you only take that 15 divided of you that 's expected amount for you to that target okay so we had me there five this year me down five in July which it was a target was a Tigers snow no targets 54 oh sorry right yeah talking for the years 50 target for the monthly for is for and we did five we did fight yeah so anything squad yeah yeah oh because at first month alone yeah thank you cut the question through the chair to mr. green please um in terms of on-page timber to you talk about the potential of a regional by law for solid waste do you have any idea on timing for that at all string the back of the room to eunice not at the stage I 'm sorry okay that 's just a idea that 's being muted it 's still a work in progress in focus okay and I 'm mr. green we saw a couple of months ago where are we act with those with results coming out please so you 're talking about the my counsel snapshots so they have the DIA have agreed to work with the sector again so with the local government in zeeland dense oldham and its continuing at the moment and there 's no set date for the release of those standards what 's the latest consultation with councils and so I 'm consultation but the in mainly around the the wording of the standards and the information that 's been provided and the worth of the standards and the way that they 've been with him all right because I would have thought the bents maps were reasonably standard I know this is a first time that those benchmarks of that nature have been done and they were done without consultation of the sector and the sector 's consents us as that they don 't represent the they aren 't a good measure of what success looks like for locita okay and just the last final question and emerging risks you identified that we 've had Park sorry um is there any correlation between us closing reads farm and this happening with tourists down that way don 't believe so you don 't believe so no that 's not um that 's not nighttime user sets the daytime use particularly at they hot water stream all right thank you Mike you 'll feel awful should out all these questions and I 'm Ted BAM 900 c management with the Waikato region civil defense group the management plan it 's actually proposed it 's not it 's not adopted all claimants the adoption of their host okay casa kruszewski just out of curiosity and and the regulatory services and the top 10 holiday park is there a big lino to five job resource consent application don 't believe that decisions been made yet but add some that it is likely yes thank you your notes not on the agenda but I 'm acted and under resource concedes I see there 's a notable tree to be removed at the Harbor because as a notable tree would there be a full resource hearing there will be a resource notified will depend on the assessment undertaken by the planet at the time soon anyway the outcome with anticipation because it 's a couple of gum trees i 'm looking at at the moment they need to go as well as well i 'm just-just I cleaner finish off that one the report undertaken by the arborist and an independent arborist and the situation identified a dead tree as at risk of failing so this is the one right by the footlocker and so therefore that 's why certain same process to get removed exit exit sexy what 's wrong with those gum trees the assessment on the gum trees isn 't they 're failing as the debris just as it 's a for mating thing when I was going through the various areas I couldn 't find the Great Lakes center but I was delighted to find under timber 19 it 's under public toilets I think the Great Lakes center needs its own section if you have a look should have told your own bringing up at times here all right just last one sorry I 'm on green um could you let us know what happened with the tribe in sculptor that sculpture sorry that we were looking at where did they end up like Johnny your request women went to the sculpture trust or give you John really yeah I was going to bring their bad science council meets an issue because their view was he didn 't fulfill the criteria that 's just a setup for which was renowned New Zealand artists and of a certain quality that wouldn 't stop us from considering it in the future so I was going to bring that button this council meeting suit because i think i was left in the earth yeah yeah that 's why I asked cuz I wasn 't sure so mix council meeting they 'll be an agenda item I 'm not here ok thank you city mr. chairman mr. Hoad it was not impressed they were referred to the sculpture trust because he said it 's not a business nothing I was great have another question of our main that relates to in bar 46 under other capital subsidy single glance seems dollars on day yeah I couldn 't find anything in the notes to know why but okay if you look at the financials and they to 125 was the subsidy for the white annoy waters can which can proceed but but while you 're looking at the financials if you can if you look at the oven 1045 the operating surface shows a deficit in comparison to budget but if you actually look at the areas that make up the manners will part of that being 1a 1b and number two down to the 27 14 9 the actual performance because all the rest of it 's made up of revaluations of assets and things of that nature the actual performance is over 3 million better than budget just the way when we bring in the revaluation of assets and all that it makes it look negative that in fact performance of counsel in that particular financial year leave by governance and then implemented by management has produced a very favorable result three million thank you any other fish man that 's arraignment ISIL you suggested reservation there on Team got this second by second see CEO so staff move by cancer petoskey sevilla by councillor pack all those in favor please say aye against Karen _"

    "text": "item number nine I think it is hello Dennis you want to break this yes biosolids and vemma composting concrete afternoon female good afternoon how was everyone sorry I just stopped you from having a break hope you 'll bear with me on this one so the purpose of this agenda item this afternoon is to seek your approval to a water contract to nokia limited who is a very composting operator in new zealand back in july the fifth just as a bit of background for you we did run a workshop with counselors to I guess discuss a number of the options open to us as a district around our bio solids management mainly because the Oh a number of options open to new zealand but we wanted to talk about some of the science behind vermicomposting because it 's not not so much about of lee new technology but something that 's been improved significantly over the recent years at that particular workshop we did discuss the fact that very composting was our preferred option and since that workshop we 've gone to tinder we ran an supplier and that 's no key limited are there any questions on this item just just through the chair and I think council body and i would probably the only council as it turned up to that which was a unfortunate and was making limited their actual company who did a presentation at their time yes and just usually with others when there 's been at nine defenses that other tenderers named it just it says that the tender evaluation and that nokia limited is preferred but it doesn 't say she who the other one was what the price price he was the other company was called enter cards too she was a joint venture essentially between a company called eco cast and intergroup know that 's right now forget it counts the factor i defied it last night of them yes I it 's just not yeah I 've got two we got two tenders on yep too compliant team do I the only hinder certainly yeah any people that can do this job it was an open tender so if I I guess that is the case on very small scale I 've got some track record on this nokia limited yes yes yes indeed yeah yeah other councils absolutely Hamilton City Council 's their biggest customer at the minute but they have a number of private sector fonterra land Corp and they 've just started to go into the the Asian market as well no they also have yes that 's that 's correct sir william science with you thank you just with regardless want to smoke would let the land application with dissolves of individual isn 't it and obviously at dogs are these nationally regard is pretty much pioneer stuff on those one down the Ralston as well friend of mine is directly isn 't that so the field so obviously if you 're coming up the option three of them very composting mr. deal with Java C or better option after all it does is that minimizes the risk that you potentially have a product I guess what really composting does is it gives you the options to apply that out the output or the Vemma cast on a much broader variety so reserves whereas with land application because of you have to apply for a resource can seem to apply it you 're constrained as to where you can actually apply it also you 'll note in this particular example will need to pay a fairly large upfront capital costs to continue with land application as we have done before they do verify counselors though just one necklace and we 're not talking about stopping the irrigation of the farmers just the right size that 's right yeah so I deal with the attorney waste stream going to landfill which the small charge associated technical question and apologize will not have attended that meeting is there any history of biodiversity mishaps because of using this particular technology because of using very composting not that I 'm aware of in the New Zealand environment I think it 's probably a lot more regulation here in this particular area but I don 't know to be honest do you mean like the sorts of scenarios you might have with a seedling pond terms of botulism and things yes so I ingest in the recommended GST would it it doesn 't state either or okay every excluding yeah it 's always gotta focus including but your mind through the chair I had a couple of questions on this thank you I note that the Vemma cost Zuma composting option requires an increase in the targeted rate moving forward not for this financial but for the next one it 's about fifteen dollars per household is that right what I just I 'm struggling to understand and maybe it 's me with my numbers it 's actually a lower cost option Zuma costing that it is with landfill so how come we 've got an increasing target a great I 'm sure you 've got an answer mr. Ward but I did notice and will noticed um excuse me the I guess is currently the we are disposing of the bottle is to landfall at the moment yep and we have done that for this win when the contract ended with the existing land disposal method we have just done that on a kind of a costume you to write to deal with the issue prior mutual we went charging ourselves this draw because there 's an internal transaction and effectively between left hand right hand so we 've to get through this kind of transitional period we 've just kid that at a effectively cost mutual right but then going in the future we need to fully cost that to the appropriate areas which is why your scene and increase the ok am thank you another couple of questions for me to you I note that the operation will require some resource consents which we won 't be applying for they will be what sort of resource consents will they be needing to seek I think it 's from the obvious is moving tight well it 's sort of like aboriginal council through Barry Campbell and he 's been quite a fait with dealing with Nokia limited before and it 's just to cover the operation the vermicomposting operation on our land so what about water take because don 't they have to irrigate and keep these worms wit how it works no it needs to be access to water it 's my understanding but and the you know and in the setup area and there is what has water up at the view road farm for thee so I I asked the question I was just conscious that we 've got the healthy River plan change we 've got the lake protection got nitrogen caprica all sorts of regulatory requirements would want to make sure because and the other one was in terms of assessment of environmental effects odors the biggest issue is that correct or fairly composting it 's certainly something that 's come up prior in their operations where you 're in an operation relatively close to residential area but it appears that through the management through the technology and the innovative way that they makes these certain things you can do in the summer period when it 's it could be more of an issue to reduce the odor so we have sensitive areas like residential areas around this proposal nice this is one is this is the view road right yep so it 's surrounded by rule family just wanting to check what 's in his care front on that inspire solid you still in a big putt there so it 's a step rushed activity in that location I just wouldn 't want to cause unintended consequences from from from out you know Oda Oda is a very difficult one to manage and mitigate understand a couple of residential these two houses I think within you know a kilometer of the operation we manage that on daily basis for the existing operations or um and this company worms like to be kept warm I did a little bit of research like 15 degrees to 27 degrees we ever done worm farming like this in a colder climate like ours currently operating a very successful wind farm and tuggerah i 'm a tokyo scholar they 're often toka walls a lot colder than what we are how long 's that found being operating because for a number of years are not sure how many years and it 's of a similar scale and size to what we propose a much bigger yeah night Rebecca okay that 's what that 's one of the Hamilton City biosolids goatee I think what winter period is that the worms actually go lower into the soil and they they cease to operate a little bit not so much activity occurs and I 'm just a final question for me at the moment if we choose this way of deciding our bio solids what impact will it have on our landfill in terms of meeting our obligations to reduce our waste there it would improve that situation market markedly this you I suppose just follow your own cancer Jonin what happens if it doesn 't work money-back guarantee that 's not right you 'll put it right and we have any guarantees well we will obviously as part of the contract and that we will sign once once this endorsement goes through there will be a certain level of service level agreements significant amounts of testing they 'll be responsible for reporting back on the resource consent as we will on the operations at view road I think whilst it 's very easy to kill worms and these guys are the best in the business in terms of knowledge of that particular area it 's I think they 're dealing with the immigrants silly stuff which is something in the order of 10,000 cubes a year so we 're a little bit smaller on there on that scale I just pick it up on Castle John was a very good point that you know the ground our ground temperatures add a lot lower than these so yeah the Hamilton product actually gets taken to Kenneth but sorry to that taco our area and can lay the product from Kenneth gets taken down so it 's not actually managed in there Morton num in addition to that as well we 've actually already ran a trial operation with they 'll biosolids to ensure that the if you like the recipe mix is works and remember the length of that troll but the results were very good let 's bring Christmas tree till July very good ok cancer cousins through the Chiefs and what you see dumb David and also councillor geologist about the environmental impact you know regards the smell exaggerated as any rust to Council of in the USA units devil 's advocate and it considering there are some environmental impacts they should be soon about these are consultation process is part of the application for resource consent that no key limited undertake finally there 's no way to do these wounds appear them gone into the river a big worms but they 're not as much calories on you but what a food cart okay so yet even just to take help the cousins comments so would this be a limited notification in terms of resource consents by Nokia limited it would be over to watch at original thousand I 've just I just know I 'm just thinking of mushroom farms in the Hawke 's Bay and all sorts of other things I 'm just conscious of yeah they would be able to have watch it original council planning officers of annotation assessment significance of effects and they wouldn 't be met at Ellis there until they have an application in front of I just think we have probably have a duty of care just to make sure we 're comfortable as well was the mushrooms and Hawke 's Bay was it smell smelly Mellie in fact it was children doing it a few questions on I 'm the item nine and we are on line up games to know number nine his comments made about religion it makes a comment here that a local contractor was putting it on the land as we 've gone through this process and didn 't he didn 't go out and find any other contractors that would have take it over from that particular person so the system would run as it is now that contractor had a specific resource consent to apply it to land any essentially is a farmer and so many farmers would require a specific consent to apply biosolids to land and there are issues relating to withholding that land if you are intending to use it for under restock yeah that was anyone approached no further down the page we 're talking about the impact on the rates of fifteen dollars per connection they 'll be right across the district and I think you 're talking here about a two percent increase correct the nvm picked on the targeted wastewater rate 's career and it 's just require in the wastewater in Urals that can 't_''_928.86 be used particularly nothing for option two in regards of the capital cost of no renewals is to renew existing assets if we were to build the new on that that 's a new asset so that would have to be loan funded okay and I 'm just going to find it on nine bar three it states that under the advantages of option two which is the land application for their navigation dilutes the toxins and heavy metals traditionally associated with raw bio solids and yet on 9 by two at the bottom of nine bite to it says a resource consent is required to be able to apply biosolids directly to land due to the elevated heavy metals contained in the bio solids and yet a previous statement sees something slightly different I 'm no they 're not in disagreement what you 're required to have a resource consent to apply biosolids to land and the process of applying the biosolids to lend you are reducing the impact of those heavy metals by okay well then can we come back to what I just raised performance mr. Ward answer that um that nine bar three what it take talks about the pit already exists but requires a covering shear or covering open tender the cost of a proxy 720 then under the disadvantage as it talks about the maturation pit of view road would require work to meet the requirements under the resource consents and an estimated cost of approximately seven twenty what are we talking about a resource consent for twenty 720 or a roof over a shared we 're talking about a roof over a shared that would be required to make consent conditions is anyone done any plans sketches drafts of what that would entail yes that 's the basis of that 720,000 is the reason that we haven 't got that in front of us because 720,000 in just about pap build two houses just running white so so answer the really fit I 've been a very big roof but I guaranteed do Feliz the roof needs to be movable because you need to be able to get to remove the biosolids so I 'm just the size and the structure and results and that sort of concept we have used a of silage if it 's like that because it would try wave runners in the hidden truth it just it 's it 's one of these things that made comment in our meeting this morning is the fact that often I find gaps in Jean writings which I find hard to actually follow particular when we 're looking at the cost that we are sketch or whatever they 're playing available cancel what EV needs be yes yeah it will be available we win with the sketch below you go there have you got the schedule i have got immediately available on me i would just at some stage of human think it 'll be after the attenti writers well it 's going to be too late if the agenda items pass doesn 't it American 11 last question for me think it already um when I 'm noki limited that their assessment obviously for the tender did they go through any analysis on risks of if there 's a higher or a medium risk of failure did they do any sort of qualitative assessment on that all the risks of contamination of the Verma costs depending on what you 're mixing it with them they cover that off these on this number of risks identified in the agenda item and they were developed in consultation with with Nokia limited they provided us for some this area of expertise in terms of the risk of contamination sorry the only what risks were they in the paper owned by five months nine bout five yep so there 's environmental risks protease risks business risks teacher in terms of the contamination issue I guess the process that they went by where they took two samples from the wastewater treatment plant and they took them away with them in over a period of i think it was december through to july they did some testing on that product because obviously the district 's biosolids as unique and and these are so exactly what restaurants it 's even unique between a monday and friday sample so they took those samples against the other municipal biosolids that they manage and we were provided with those results and it was interesting because and i think we had a discussion councillor body and I at the workshop just recently around the fact that we believe that we had potentially higher arsenic then then we you know based on some of their understanding we head of our own biosolids but yet compared to Hamilton as was quite a lot lower but there are other heavy metals that came up so through that process I guess they identified they gave us a list of several different mixing products that they could use to manage the dilution and also to ensure that the wounds were the most happy okay all right now thank you okay cancer park thank you I 'm just just um I just wanted to submit mr. Fox when we had a workshop on this we were a presentation was done by Nike limited this theme went out um the tenders for a two-week process in which we got torn up and like you 've got it do you feel from a risk this procurement process because I just yeah I just I 'm just we got well we got presented really great presentation and I have trust in this company but I just wonder if it 's been is transparent as as possible because I just from a risk management perspective and big pre-election period I simply don 't_''_1329.76 I just feel a little uneasy and I just wonder from your risk management perspective if you could um help me research that 's gone into this particular gender are over four years probably 10 or thora was my view you 've had a workshop that some of you attended we 've been a lot of as I was talked about discussions with officers in the company are you talking about the tenure of the time frame for the procurement particularly in a lot just the fact that it was that company that presented to us and then there was a short in every season thing no it was I 'm just clarified that sorry to interrupt and leave it that July to the 27th of July if that 's normal that 's to vote on the ocean this week I 'm actually through the project I 'm just wondering on direct so there 's only two weeks on the tinder being request 16 today 16 days here yes that is correct I guess part of that was because of the process that we 've gone through up to that point we understood we had a fairly good understanding of the market I guess we were surprised to see only two operators be able to operate at that level or be interested perhaps and responding to our tender we also felt that given the time frames that we were required to meet to ensure that we could bring this to you and within the appropriate time frame so that you had adequate time to decide and because we 've been working on this okay since the end of last year when the previous operator ceased to provide that that we felt that that was adequate time for operators in that market to respond to our needs being a smooth you know municipal biosolids provider as we are just if I can define it information or suggest that the time frame was too short no I 've seen the appetizers though so I sense a bit of nervousness around the table with some of the council so you go test your resolution so just through the chair I 'm quite comfortable if I can be if if um management is capital that this is being done appropriately just ask Miss Lewis preps your nose you 're very senior engineers in the background the say you 've got full support of an your team within your engineering team for this proposal that 's correct thank you I 'm just on on a possible take on unity through the children 's you know sorry i missed a workshop just back croaking ribbit obviously in New Zealand 's 60 sixty-two percent worldwide sales goal and Phil compared Australia melody ever good crystal ball but various miss already calculations to any other situation around the country or will you can estimate it will be reduced to from that I always the Australia it 's 15 dissenters different sort of environment but is there any estimate or just the total amount of bio solid municipal dry solids going to landfill would be in the future hmm well I guess the central government has a view because they are applying an ETS you know the trip that emissions trading scheme livvie on everything goes to landfill from January of next year and it was brought forward from 2019 I know there are a number of councils such as Queensland Queenstown Lakes who are looking at performing a very composting operate operation just to get stuff out of landfill and so I don 't mean it 'd be great to have a target like Europe for example but I think it will take time predominantly for the reasons that I outlined in the presentation which is it 's cheap to stick it in landfill in New Zealand 's it 's super cheap it 's not 500 euros a ton we 've got lots of free land we 're not overpopulated you know some councils are still putting it out to sea so you know until we guess the compliance and regulations cracks down this still that option yeah thank you sure 's been an option here as perry the most cheap and moseph russian anything environment friendly way disposing of biosolids I understand lyrica is quite big business yeah I actually haven 't heard of that isn 't as a as an option in the New Zealand market it becomes a sweetener as the product in the ground just on a positive note then from what I 've heard today by going this way we epitope we open up our market for this product greater than we 've got now with the sprout of view road that we create so therefore we can expect a greater return because has put on pasture for hay and silage for dairy cows it can 't_''_1632.51 be used with what we 've got in our part it 's been some research although the is not enough detailed analysis and to the different crops into the application of vermicompost on crops such as Lou soon and rye grass by comparison to simple land application of biosolids that research the Jesus that it is an increase in growth but the exact percentage is unknown I don 't 's safe to say it 's it 's it 's good give you a crop but unknown at the moment you all right probably canvas was me rocker the lead leaders in this said they 've got their own do me composting bin the posting what he was good operation the air okay so do I since bit of happiness around the questions obviously will the contract will be you know really water tighten the Esper the questions in avast I think doesn 't work we 'll get Nigel pass on to it um all right we 're going to suggested resolution the baby thank you for help and thank you dennis for your item here today so do i have our move up for this resolution moved by Councillor pack seeking a broken sorry counselor stewart have seen by councillor kruszewski you want us want to spare against the resolution I 'll move it in and all those in favor please say aye i inched carry _"

if I could flip back to them yes okay so hook a zip line they are just going to say your worship that Rona setting for arms upon the minute thank you right here before your proposal for the zip line it if I draw your attention to page 12 5 4 12 sorry 12 by five you see there an aerial of what is proposed it 's loud if members are unaware some meters off the ground and it creates the opportunity for people to supper long the line I 'm not doing justice to their I 'm socks yep so the so the proposal is to have an office in the vicinity of the helicopter cafe there and run the zip line in the road corridor on to the east of what a key drive and terminating and where the wrist area currently is and I think it would probably be better if you 've got any specific questions on the proposal itself to direct them to your own assignment so gladness parallel mother beside the road basically yep pretty much parallel we saw we had ever put our final details as i said i mean it does run through the galleys etc and through the trees so it 's all on council council lent yep and classified as raid reserve yep council kruszewski yes thank you very much a couple of questions and firstly sounds like something for my bucket list the first question that i have is that what is the current canopy height across all along that corridor sort of 30-40 meters i see under proposal is I 've got the tower lights at 30 meters are not at 30 meters that was basing this it would be the maximum height from the wire to the bottom of the galleys see our Heights are going to be around 12 meters 30 meters can run basically all those tears right through there the platforms will be inside the canopy that of the right side it felt like tanks are extruded over to Canada I guess inside the kennett video yeah the next question that I had was related to you you say that there will be an aerial walkway connected to platforms and is that on a while or just think of a walking bridge a while walking bridge with with with timber steps inside it they 're very common or in the world with us with a sort of activity that 's just threw one part of the gully that we 're looking at the one Ridge the next ridge just break the tour up to to keep it a bit different okay so that 's another activity I may is an in your peak period what would be your expected or anticipated additional bus service and movements basically or company or business we operated and down the bottom of the demo helicopter and the souvenir shop yes and we 'll be busting people back to the cords will have buses with 10 people at the time yeah such well maybe bit more yeah and we can do up to and we want to spending peoples who can 't win would you do up to talking 400 people day if as a business builds over that over time so basically would just be our own our own equipment moving up there be no public parking upwards with no no what I was just like to sort of look at a number of additional fascist using that narrow road and how many movements that would create York tippy would create during the peak period possibly for now for now available transport but that wouldn 't need the large my sister dutiful no no Widow we will double for the large classes want the epi OU v lo2 small coaches from a clear point on page bag 1201 you 've got just before the consideration got you si can exclusively for these sites to ensure they able to be accessed back yours but let 's try and get me around the difference between the lease and or a Russian to occupy you 'd be happier that as well oh I see this deep dances that explain it through you your worship you 're not allow I 'm not able to issue a lease for a well-conceived what you into a social and license to occupy and that would that 's a short-term license to occupy you thank you so just follow the use of the word Road and I 've got the map he and it 's not on the road should we be referring to Road mizzou rather than above a row and then it mentions and 320 by one of the bottom for a temporary period what 's temporary an answer to the first question and strictly legal terms right reserved as road irrespective of whether it 's formed or not the temporary period is something that would thank you sir cousins just what I say to Papa zipline paul zipline story through professional presentation so thank you and the second comment was if you were declined here today we 've got some nice leaned and chillin it we 'd like to put that one will pump you up thank you very much like onions okay any other questions of Simon around and one final one and that relates to your seeking a 30-year lease what would be the absolute minimum noman minimum that would allow you to be profitable well twenty long years well no substantial investment but it 's something at is there 's a gap in Taupo in the tourism department everything so it 's a great thing it 's a fifth most popular excursion a world of moments appliances it 's really big so I think I 'd like yeah we well under the longer the period a bit of rust see ya destination great liked opal general manager jumping in seat theatre have another product that we can offer so certainly you know it 's just what a wonderful it comes off it tourism industry and i would suggest cancer park i just am i suppose mr. green around the negotiations for thin license to occupy how do we need to define their in the resolution in regards to and time frame and my suggestion would be that you leave it to two officers to negotiate with them with the applicants assuming that dumb that you 're happy to approve in-principle approval the activity as I think counselor crossed mr. Starsky said is that there is going to be a minimum time which is economically feasible from our perspective is the shorter time the better from a we don 't know what the future the rotors but there 'll be a sweet point there some way I I 'd be happy to move the recommended resolution one okay because before it 's moved about one question regards of furman abruptly and here market rent what 's the procedure for working out is that it 's the rent or the license to occupy costs as per what we would normally be charged in the given area for how does that work this one is 's something that I don 't have an immediate answer for you it 's something that we 'd need to investigate in and work out like some crazy idea evaluation think you should just see that she I just had a question for Simon and I love the idea and be on my bucket list too I just had one question in terms of exclusive rights to this area you mention like to see some exclusivity so that there aren 't any other activities that might give safety issues for what you 're doing what would you envisage that might be we did talk about this originally there are I think there may be other people interested in some sort of walkway through there or the planners I 've been talking to greening taupo at the moment that all that whole area on the side the road has been a dumping ground for many many years he handed it to me so l big plan is to clean ball up take all the rubbish out there with a plan thousands and native trees through the able to bring a little the public can walk through their turrets no sir okay so how 's your bosom happier great i totally it senses thank you the towers and the buffer zones yeah sure you would want to get too close to those anyway I imagined it thank you very good okay well done gentlemen thank you very much i think it 's been moved by Councillor pack did I have a second five cans of williamson all those in favor please say aye aye against Kerry _"

    "text": "I number sex alysha point B where boys I was just having a practice run Columbia yours dudes however the renewals yeah well I would take the item is read that I would just point out on page six bar to under the financial considerations in your clean we talked the budget of 300,000 being within the 2016-17 main transport program what their budget is made up of as 200,000 of widening that specifically identified than the long-term plan in the additional 100 k is for renewals as we did with point B road last year when we do the widening there 's often components of drainage renewal or pavement renewal so that funding is on their own that comes out of the 2.5 million dollars worth of renewal funding that 's allocated annually for roading renewals that was what my question was at you think you mr. Louis I just with this item and number seven both the engineers estimates are quite light compared to the Tinder 's but they 're both widening work so that because of materials or a combination of things like is one of the to to get the right amount we we look at what being happening in the market what what sort of previous person we 're giving in sometimes the engineers estimates not quite what the market is currently producing often i would say to my guys affects what the process which you 're offering to do it for that price well that the LX we 're also going ya think so but potential engineers estimates out the amount allocated in the bud no no no no help thinking George it okay so those what was somebody input of transit New Zealand than this widening program I 'm easy ta offending this 51-percent and just a quick we 've asked on several occasions no local companies because they 're not around here to do probably because they 're all busy at the moment yeah you 're wondering there are no specific contractors they up there that deal Justin roading meters there are costs associated with building roads in terms of health and safety because you 're operating in a an operating environment if otherwise you could be building subdivisions and this a but typically these types of we attract contractors that specialize and enrolling works and that 's what you 're seeing in the tendency this particular tenderer and completed the previous work for us to head that 's correct yet a very good standard yes all right okay suggesting resolution there and if I Kansas turns into burkittsville Williamson for deep all those in favor please say aye thanks Gary I 've number seven broadlands Road area wide treatment you know worship take the Artemis read I just advise further work for the point B Road the budget is allocated out of the transport will roading renewals budget of 2.5 million just on seven by one where it 's the tender price is rated simmer them by 314 to 498 it is not sure why there is it can be many many things that can be that someone is putting an attender price just to show some interest it can be put on about hopefully a busy will put on the price if we work I ask without get a 2 with a somewhere in the middle all they mr. spread mr. Louis and it goes back to councillor parks comment on the previous one this one is significantly over the engineer 's estimate by about thirty percent or it 's what 's happening there um I don 't have a specific answer other than what I provided for the previous when it 's really it 's really about an assessment of what the market rates are typically and basing base calls and it can depend on our concreteness pricing to get that base course where he gets it from what what pricey has to pay to get there no I just I just know I just want it noted because it it seems quite substantial in this case talking about engineer will you absolutely okay thank you want to make a point yeah you have a sweepstake in the office you know to see here closer digging oh definitely not your word is justice shut on 33 through the cheerio would caution too much weight on the engineer 's estimate and that it 's not the budget so it is really just a data the dartboard and really as a before the budget still such theories and this doesn 't relate to the engineer 's estimate anyway mr. Chu and its be fair to say today that for 2.5 when air down Tibet what one point you gotta sound rude we get that one per seat back rings yes yes if this is a hundreds they 're the two point one of the renewals budget it 's creepy they 're not creative yeah it 's funded 51% so even though those and renewable yes yeah you 're born with the train set Oh of the transport farm budgets are funded 51-percent by NZTA except for cl extension which is one hundred percent by counsel ok so the renewals in what 's in our budget that that 's the amount from canceled oh that 's the total budget includes watch from trenton yes thankee ok so I 'm ceilings everywhere yes so we need to move for move I kasib suski thinking to buy counselors to it all those in favor please say aye run against ok and will do night an awesome system will do item number eight and then a zip line I will forward if that 's okay because we have a confirm that and they ask them when I hope those guys up too much so will do night apart number right now you worship snapper that 's why not the water supply is the pump station and pipeline afraid there are problems experienced recently with the the map of pump station and it 's outlined in the paper it 's for the construction of a new pump station and for about three or four hundred K on us re 300-400 meters of new pipeline I 'm Sony co-counsel park just through the cheer and on 10 14 of the CEOs report and that drinking water pressure off in flown council response and there 's been one complaint so is this project of some urgency or uselessness of some urgency it just it just it 's just not noted that there are any complaints from their area that 's all that 's why good management more than we don 't complain now they 're right okay whatever I think I only need a me question if I the fourth paragraph that it will also provide significantly more capacity can you quantify the word significantly for me please off the top of my head no account but I could certainly go back and get the actual numbers yes mate yep 90 anybody happy to do they turn it density is this a rural supply acacia bay or know that surprise its supply the occasional heights why I hesitate I think it goes out the oh but we as the initial source of them okay should be ok your baby so this would be funded on the target array defecation bay yes thank you okay do we have a mover the map Ravelli see if I can sit back seemed to bounce the hobby all those in favor please say aye aye it 's scary _"

    "text": "okay item number for mr. Dennis Lewis asset manager solid waste and stormwater request to extension for of two ringy and I Maury refuse transfer station so during into memoria don 't go yet that 's something else on here ok mislis good afternoon your worship councillors you 're going to see a little bit of me this afternoon yes you might be secondly by the time I finished I 'll take the item as read and ask for any questions any questions of mr. Lewis overall a bit starstruck I 'm sorted yes thank you you worship I just had a question Dennis and it was more a philosophical discussion was that we seem to have a lot of contract extensions coming up for a variety of different types of services and I just and one of the reasons why we we don 't go out and reach in der is because of the call costs obviously re-tendering on individual projects is there any point in time where maybe we should try and align some of this work so that when we do need to go out or a see quite a few of these coming through i 'm wondering if there 's a smarter way we can manage it together lose the question i 'm not asking for an answer right now but i 've probably got quite a detailed answer for you because it 's tied up and both the service that you 're seeking so different contractors are delivering different sorts of services and i had mentioned before and the chamber about putting tension on to contract or so rather than putting out a five-year contract or receiving year contract we reduce the time frame and then add some additional years on to keep that tension and performing and that 's typically what you 're seeing certainly one of these your ways of going about it has just put out a five-year contract or something of that nature but then you tend to lose the tension and performance yeah I wasn 't proposing that we might extend our contracts longer terms but was rather they all seem to be coming up at similar times and yeah I 'm not sure that there would be any benefit to have different tenders so the cost of producing this tender and say the one following are still going to be fairly similar costs irrespective of what time you 'd yes no I just just speak the question because I 've seen quite a few come through recently and I don 't understand the idea of tension there ordinarily with these taught sorts of requests you would get them spread out and during the year but because of the the election cycle and the financial year the need to know really enough if we 're going to have to go out to tender than we need to plan that so you 've tended to compress the time over which were you bringing these to your attention good answer thank you cancer hickling that is what was the driving factors for the increase in the contract less for this one is primarily cost escalation over the team of the contract when you say cost calculation is that its payroll or is it wages typically with these tomb contracts we provide for cost the escalation and that 's usually based on a within the conditions of contract is a fairly complex formula for working out cause fluctuations and that 's really put in there to minimize the risk of the if you put out a contract say for three or five years and you don 't allow for cost escalations then the contract is going to take a punter on what 's going to happen and so they 'll build that into the contract if you tie that into a known formula then you 're taking that risk out of the out of the contract I just noted that makes sort of three items I think so there 's an increase of around about 200,000 on on each contract can take a few dollars a year this that 's for the year yeah yeah it is an increase in that through the cheer on this particular one that 's gone up from 188 to 196 which is actually only a four percent increase over three years or 200 years yeah okay yeah the point he makes that still more than the rate of inflation yeah 3 years yeah just just through the when you do these extensions on existing contracts add their contractual obligations under the new health and safety that 's full of it under that under the respective tiendas use so any cost escalation they will include any just okay Thank You counsel Chris us Keith Lasley follow on the same the umbilical Eon Councillor John sponsorship looking ahead is that an organization said that we aligned to such a bach less and less and various regional things is there any and future benefit in joining up add those bigger contract so we can extrapolate a better negotiated price and that that whole region has that 's always a consideration one of the things that we need to be mindful as a district is when you start agglomerating contracts you start reducing the contractor Paul you will have seen and we 've noticed that with NZTA reducing the contracts that have been serviced in the Talpiot region from three down to one two contractors so then let 's least contractors available to price for work locally so one of it 's sort of its weighing out what the benefit of it 's that 's something that you 've got to consider through to sell him some just on the point of regarding the rate of inflation with regard to the increases would perhaps be more relevant to apply the rugged urban cost index would not necessarily the right inflation is four percent increase over yeah but over three years but one point on a year which is probably inflation I 'm coming from this end of the lake and I actually would like to move the suggested resolution because I 'm also knowing they owe nori and the tyrrhenian transfer stations in the work the staff are doing down there they kept really well it 's it 's working so I 'm quite happy to move this resolution who is the contract metallic sweeping all right be moved by Councillor Stewart seconded by rosovsky recommended

    "text": "I to number three and funding requests by go to hunger dido we have mr. Manik Carol policy manager to present this item good afternoon there in your worship and councillors and you will have noted in the minutes earlier that you receive go Tongariro presented to the community board in July they presented a proposal to develop a plan and sort some funding that proposals now come forward to you full consideration of that funding since that proposal was presented to the board we work with go tongariro to clarify exactly what the scope of their workers and what they want that funding for what you 'll see in the papers are presented is the original proposal detailed and then the revised proposal the recommendation to you is that funding is made available in two parts the first part is funding for some economic analysis and that 's economic analysis that both go tongariro and council can use for our future planning and the second part is that fundings made available to a cisco tongariro to engage independent expertise to develop their plan that 's all I intended to the item is red and I 'm very conscious we 've got members of go tongariro here who may wish to speak to you about their proposal indeed thank you there 's any questions of nick kurczewski thank you i 'm just reading through the minutes and and i noticed that on to bar one when tongariro community board had its meeting under tuesday at twelve of july under the presentation it says under the first term paragraph the feasibility study on the turing it CBD more but only on the next paragraph and the last line it says develop a strategic economic growth plan for too rainy can you just and enlarge for me exactly what it is because the two are in my way of thinking a quite different succinctly different and have different outcomes as well so yeah I I would definitely agree with you I think the two are all could definitely different have different outcomes I think it 's probably most appropriate for go tongariro when they speak to you to outline exactly what they believe the detail of that plan will be but I about in the paper is intended to provide answers about what the future economic demands are likely to be in the terrain e situation what are going to be those drivers for the economy going forward what are going to be the land requirements that we have not only in the CBD but also in the industrial area so that 's what the economic analysis will cover and I think go Tom Rio is probably in a better place to talk about exactly what their intended plan will cover just one more question if I may some of the facts and figures that you 'll you 'll be seeking presumably have already been done once before the not so distant past when we looked at tongariro once before during you once before before we did the amal up upgrade and and didn 't turtle pool and all that kind of thing is there any of that still around and useful and even heard in it he yes and no there was a lot of work that was done down in the Turing area as part of the initial work around analysis that was done at that time so that 's definitely a hole that we 've had in the past and we continue to have in terms of our future decision making as accountable and that 's what the economic analysis is meant to fill that home feel having said that there was still a lot of perception work done at that stage around where does the community see their future how do they see the town moving forward and economic sense as well as a social sense so there 'll be all of that perception work and some urban design work that we can carry forward into future plan ok thank you you can somebody humans character just clarify the two resolutions before us what 's your interpretation of an independent economic analysis it 's an economic analysis produced by an economist who is independent from counsel and who would appoint that economist the intention at this point having talked to go tongariro is that counsel would engage the economist and seek that advice now the brief would be prepared jointly with go tongariro to ensure that they and forward I 'm very conscious that the planning that counsel does for Turing ye towne center and the wider Turing area may have slightly different focus from what go tongariro is seeking to do in the immediate future that 's why it 's important that we work together collaboratively to get the best out of that economic analysis for the right pair things you and I wait before the debate to continue and just maybe come back on the word independent think he just Carol just a clarification on go tongariro just see em so they report to us once a year what does their funding stream again so go tongariro have a contract with council they 're partly funded by council that contract says a couple of things in terms of reporting at section 6 of their contract the first point is that there 's a requirement to meet on a six weekly basis that 's been taking place down to rainy and has involved governance so that 's very much a general progress update the second part of that reporting requirement is around the presentation of an annual the next one funnily is going to be presented next month 27th of September 2016 so you 'll have an opportunity to look at that as part of that process and their music so report to us once a year yeah so so those are the reporting requirements a very micro day-to-day progress report on weekly basis and then your financial reporting and progress reporting against the the requirements you 've put in that contract and that takes place on an annual basis through the chair i 'm also the liaison officer council and community board for gradual you know so i 've reported back to council when there 's been things of its been initiate we need to be noted we keep fear we 're off so the has happened as well thank you okay thank you mr. Carroll then she answered John 's sorry just a question oh just a question mr. Carroll the scope of the work that is to be anticipated with a strategic review can you give us an indication of what you think that will cover as obviously you 've got a price for scope will be are you referring to the economic analysis I used reject economic growth plan I think as I mentioned earlier to Council of crystal ski that 's probably a question better directed towards go tongariro I know that had some discussions with some consultants who work in that field around the sort of plan that could be delivered and what it would cover off and that 's why you 'll see that the resolution talks about a price up to 55,000 dollars the expectation is that it could well be delivered for less than there some so the expectation from council is that would that scope cover a review of our infrastructure as well know now the the study may well consider what infrastructure is in place and that information is publicly available but it wouldn 't Consuela we wouldn 't expect it to consider our wholesale review of the infrastructure requirements going forward surely if you are enabling economic environment and the council 's responsible for helping provide that environment we 'd want to cover their off and the scope yeah one of the challenges that counseling of a town and a dynamic environment I think we 'll all except that the ideal would be to sit down one Sunday afternoon draft up the perfect plan and then go ahead and implement it unfortunately that doesn 't take place we have requirements under the long-term plan in terms of rolling out a work program we have asset management plans which have to be updated gradually there are other tools such as the district plan which can take several years to put into place so what we 're looking at is an ongoing or a rolling process I guess of aligning both the planning of DG LTE glt go tongariro and council to ensure that as partners in the space of two ringy that we 've got a consistent planned strategy going forward sure but if the ultimate gain gain is to work out what 's best for two ringy shouldn 't we be looking at ourselves warts and all and just understanding what it is that we need to do to move forward rather than trying to say Hester fur and what we 've currently got the go tomorrow we 'll look at that from a particular perspective particularly a strong economic perspective in the development of their plan council similarly will look at that over the coming years with regard to our infrastructure with regard to the way we manage public space and Turangi with regard to the way we manage your own service delivery down there the lights of the eyesight and the library as an example we 'll also look at that with regard to other tools that we 've got such as land use requirements in the district plan in particular in that space so there are a whole basket of different tools in different perspectives and I think the key thing going forward is that we 're working collaboratively with the other partners to ensure that if we put each of those pieces of the puzzle into place we 're doing it in a cohesive way rather than a divisive way I would be quite interested I understand Gautama raros perspective because I think it 's really important whatever we do with this plan that it has the Bayern of all stakeholders best results no funds I 've been answered thank so your worship all right thank you very much Castle Park and yes thank you mr. Carroll I just wonder when you talk about the scope of the project add cg LT considered the recommended reservation without a DJ of T considered as part of that as far as destination management goes you would we 've had quite a lot of discussion with go tongariro and the shaping up of the thoughts around this planning work going forward and they 've been very open and acknowledging that this needs to involve engagement with other matters they 've got a very strong link obviously through to enterprise great lake tahoe but also destination great lake taupo and but i think everyone would openly acknowledge that tourism is a key component of that economy going forward so having DT LT as part of the ongoing discussion and the development of their plan is going to be critical just as it 'll be critical having counsel involved given a public land ownership and infrastructure provision in that town it 's been could be funded kill um yeah fine Smith would you like to come forward down chairman of go Tom get it on and they 've racine cameras at the end Christine not yeah cool gotta have company one good afternoon good afternoon and welcome yeah so we 're sure as yours so when so thank you your worship Amir counselors oh I just like to read you a pre-prepared statement that we 've put together and just really outline our rationale behind what we 're trying to achieve today goat on Guerrero first of all go to agree we would like to acknowledge and thank that helper district council for this opportunity to talk briefly in support of our funding submission this before you go taqueria also wishes to acknowledge the assistance and advice from the Carroll and the staff within TDC and putting the submission together on our behalf and we would also acknowledge the support and suggestions of the jenga tongariro community board who was out there assistance in the beginning this motion already would not have started and also obviously the community of tyranny as well because they have a thank you turangi the little town there should have that didn 't some say that to Rainey town center is pretty shabby a bit of a ghost town businesses are closing nothing to attract the visitors into town and they say Turing he has not a lot to offer those are generally feedback that we 've had from various review sites people that have come through to renew so that 's their that 's their perception of what they see and Turing it was a town with a great future which is now behind it so that gives you an indication of where as a community we are coming from and what we 're trying to improve going into the future however go tongariro believes in recent trends tent would suggest that Turing it does have a future but that future needs direction guidance and an orchestrated implemented implementation of an independent strategy plan to achieve the greater greater success i tells vibrancy is about the dynamic of the whole community in the area not just the state of the town center so it 's not just the town center as a whole and comets earlier through when Nick was talking is that it is very important that we communicate and with the key with the community of tyranny in the absence absence of any current economic development plan for Turing if there is a compelling need for such a strategy as go tongariro proposes which will provide the pathway forward this is a direction that the community of Turing is now demanding the document before you outlines go tongariro strategy to achieve the desired economic growth for to ringing this is an opportunity for the current CFO District Council to send a strong and convincing message to the community of Turing that by supporting goten Guerrero 's application for funding TDC recognizes the importance of this independent study and the results that it will provide for the community of tyranny thank you questions you went Christine did you wanna chip anything in at the state all right ok questions cancer kruszewski thank you for that I just come back to the point that are raised earlier and I noticed that under revised proposal the fourth bullet point once again with a view to establishing a future positioning of the town center I can 't identify key influences not from my perspective I would like to think and hope that we are not just concentrating on the touring in town center as indicated on on here quite correct a method that is a that 's an assumption as I say getting the wording are right and of the two meetings and numerous emails that we have had to get to the proposal with us before you at the moment obviously things like that slip through but it is a community-based initiative and as addressing the community as a whole strengths and weaknesses opportunities and threats are really what we try to get out there to get an action plan together that didn 't give us a pathway to go forward thank you sir cousins through the chair I just want to say to the council and knowledge all the telling people that are here today and tom newly from Tim another community board this shows how much this means to our community I don 't think I 've ever seen it 's very heartening to see also ID technology Christine in Duane from gautama girl who have put this together Christine for her diligence she did everything there was asked of her of counsel and above and she has followed through on that so she needs to be christinies be commended I had set a question for Christine terms of the review it is my understanding from their brief and wanking answers as well that we wanted to be 360 he won 't be a 360-degree view of ourselves and audit would that be correct everyone at we we are that that 's look at all that what 's not thank you that 's a pack I 'm either Thank You Christine and when and used to do do a great job at down as our southern end and the second of 55 k i 'm just wondering being unbudgeted expenditure how have you come about that this is the right amount we win we started to back on this project we tested the market and regarding water would cost to try and get some form of feasibility study strategy a form that we could then work with on a short to medium-term timeframe and we got three indications from the market of what the cost would be and at varied between 35 to 55 thousand dollars just depending on whether you took the whole nine yards of the of what was available he of the recommendation so that was really the market price that we put into the submission so you 're quite comfortable yes mr. president we 've we 've checked that and as i say there 's opportunities to to work collaboratively as as mr. Carroll has outlined and has talked that up by getting some of that information the data on a collaborative basis that could take away some of the expenditure that we 're looking at but that 's still a as a yet to be defined an amount okay thank you yes I haven 't yes I think that sounds like a really great idea and I like the idea of sayings you know the way he said it 's a warts-and-all looking at everything right through the whole township everybody are you going as stakeholders including business owners building owners have you gone through it we 've had loose discussions at this stage because really we had a plan to actually do this prior to making a submission but obviously for us to progress funding or the lack of funding would would mean the successful not the success of the project so we decided to put the funding application ahead of getting a working group put together and that would involve members of the community stakeholders and in the during tongariro community board to actually get up set of guidelines put together before we start to go further afield but it would and we would envisage and having public meetings with the community as a whole to give your mum polite all together took you the town centre i think it 's vital to get some building owners as part of this yeah so they buy into it and see can see what what you 're trying to achieve and you know it 's it 's not just about talk it 's about actually action yeah making something happen yes almost definitely in in the past where things are set on shelf and gather dust for just one project that as far as we know John Barrera we don 't want that to happen yeah thank you there 's on their cousins sorry um Thank You counsel happy this is a defining document for us hold our town and that 's why it 's so crucial yeah which one to take control of our future I think that the community you talk about stakeholders are safe half the gallery would love to be as part of that group networking group he was mooning around buddy it 's going back to who 's going to be engaged if we look at three of our to it states quite clearly that engaging with the community and specific stakeholders so I think you 've covered that but I 'm also interested in take it up councillor Cassavetes comments on three bar one it actually states your abilities go tongariro and I 've just read the words to be able to demonstrate that as a clear plan to support the delivery of economic growth and you 're the town center Wayne option one states go tongariro to prepare the strategic document what are your views on how this document should be put together should I be go tongariro by itself council by itself or its mr. Carroll said a joint effort I think it has to be a joint effort there we don 't have the resource or the the ability to be fair the resource that you see as presently sitting in front of you between Christina and myself end up so it is imperative that we have those relationships both with type I district council EG ltd glt the community board and the can the stakeholders in the community of turing something that we can 't do by ourselves so we need to have that important just follow that up milana thinking if you had a completely independent person doing the right yep that no type of the council or yourselves do you think you may get a more Wharton all assessment of what Turing it may or may not need as a possibility that is a possibility although I would like to think that if there was something that was quite obvious you would you would get it doesn 't matter what side of the fence they were on so to speak thank you just one last question for me thank you um I just a guess it 's seeking some assurances that the report that you 're going to do I guess is going to be all encompassing because very much some of the keywords I see in this proposal talk about economic indicators but true sustainable planning for a future includes social economic cultural and environmental factors so you 'll be looking at all of those is that the intention with this report yes it is there 's these things that obviously goat on baroque and act upon and is there will be no doubt parts of the report that would be better suited for council to pick up on and but that 's for the future we don 't know precisely what we 're going to get until we get it but certainly it will be all encompassing that 's great because I mean I go back and I look at sit up and it 's all about empowering yourselves in the community to actually take the lead on this so I would like to make sure that it 's council we don 't slow you down on that process and let you make it happen yeah oh sorry sorry that 's right now no Carolyn Kaster Williamson through this year thank you refine okay all the CEOs you know with the I also CEO collaborative might see a collaborative approach note for the through though it 's a process through the pineal gland is obviously going going through the air but we also have to be so smart and be equipped to respond to change opportunities and obviously a healthy district there 's a healthy touring as well as thank you note El Paso yes you know you did your fingers do I was that economic growth me here without doubt and I think the community of Turangi seems to for whatever reason seems to think it 's been shortchanged in the past and that 's in the past now we 're moving forward looking forward so this is a far from a community to actually galvanize the community together and some accept that that will be achievable city yes acclaimed so you 've read the officer 's report yes I take it yes um there 's three options there yes which is you 're not particularly keen develop Shin three no I would like to have that motion I know we could delete thank you certainly option one was the option that we put forward in our original submission are and that 's just a statement of fact option two I would suggest is also very workable it 's so really option one or option two but not options three things it cost us ki thank you my final question is that in all of the documentation that i have read as I haven 't come across any time lines per se can you give me an indicative idea as to when you 're trying to and hoping to achieve something for the next phase so to speak originally had a timeline in the very beginning of somewhere in the vicinity of four to six months to get the but i would suggest certainly was in 12 months i would like to think that it would be well and one and entrenched by then there were any requirements for future funding it could be incorporate on the next long-term plan yeah and that 's why i say there will no doubt be items that will drop out of the strategy though that we 're looking for it may well fit and fall into the long-term plan and you know so that 's always an option cancer cousins I 'm fine I 'm just so I suppose not was seen any through the discussion on the understanding that you 'll be doing sound reporting back to community board and through counsel and that you 've written clamors to be with council and that it 's a 360 degree review of our situation I 'd like to move recommended resolution option 2 i 'm thinking that okay all right just like that any other any other comment I think I think well done and thank you for your complication here and obviously the supporters here today wonderful to see ya see I think there 's a lot of nodding going around the room so well though we 're more than happy to support this proposal mmm I think it says a defining document they could could represent that the future so with it being the case it 's been moved by Councillor cousins seconded by Councillor stood and I think no one wants to speak again against the motion all those in favor please say aye rise against Kerry oh good are you very much thank you item number _"

    "text": "yeah let 's remember sitting local governments excellence program mr. Knight I 'll take my eye on this race this is a little bit of a moving feast of BSA and the program 's deeply infancy remember from mr. greens email I think down two months ago six weeks ago after the local governments New Zealand was looking to mortise programs and they were seeking foundation councils I 've just given the timing of their announcements and lean decision to make we win for his officers and suggested that we would be interested in being involved what that 's to do is to consist in an induction workshop we did on the eighteenth and nineteenth of July which was very enlightening in terms unseen in what the program is intended to achieve and how developed it was there would be fair to say there is a lot of work that still required around the process of how councils performance will be measured I guess by way of example there were four priority areas under each of those priority areas they were says measurement criteria he started falling by the end it was it was definitely some movement around not only how the process will take place but also exactly what we would be mission teams so that means it 's gone away it will contain all to further refine it and tension that they expressed it that workshop is that there would be a pilot program with the first three councils falling out of that pilot program there will be a whole lot of learnings that will enable sub councils to be in a much better position to understand exactly how you will be measured and how they may be communicated with community as well and so that 's that we 're the program 's editor so very much in this tendency with that pilot hopefully delivering quite a lot of learning for the Consul General thank you know so that 's the body to Carol the young senator local government is also cannot local up that private way so I plan report review of councils witnesses crossover we trying to reinvent the wheel to be done wasn 't regarding the my read of the situation is that local government minister and has suggested that the minister is not necessarily measuring the things that really matter to the community in terms of demonstrating the quality of the service that councils provide this program is very much about trying to build the community confidence and trust and services that we provide and given that they believe that ministers attempt has not done that this is intended to be a local gov newzealand driven program having sip and while they 've initiated it we 've gone to great pains to make it as independent as possible and therefore to add value to the program and its results and their independence is coming there an independent assessment board which will oversee the program so essentially local government kicks it off handed the assessment boarded in running and the actual assessment process will be undertaken by independent Assessors so this is a high level of Independence associated with this process and the overall preview and I believe that that will add quite a lot of credit each other in the public 's eye cheaper so ago and it 's going to be a whole a once over lightly of a human decatur 's give me a bit more in depth and enable you and community riding the bike how we perform inning and a at a broader since then than just those those killers as the initiative preserve energy from government wire go presented on back to central nervous if we want to alcohol that what you 're talking about now it 's very suspicious of when you talk about that independence the independent Assessors going to be founded by local government that worries me so I 'm a comment on a single part of the first part of the local government resulted my face those comments to muscle and monster in cabinet disagree a lot of government is alone quietly through that process so their feet literally eating which is asking them if we as local government asking for something that we can go back to the people who are the people come to your local governance if we want one way of measuring this council against any other council so there 's a little bit of that mixture of evident in mrs. saying to have a point of measurement can only be a good thing because they were identifying where we are wish when we are good and particular by identifying those weaknesses me so we can put music placed about improve them so if you don 't usually your records very hard to improve in this that 's what I see this program being a an opportunity to have a baseline position which is relevant to local government posts just once over lightly snikt snapshots that particular governments are releasing which will then enable us to build into improved improvements for our okay so we can show not just shows that ratepayers but actually improve our services to provide a better service to our community volumes cheering there was 21 councils out of the 70 something that an initial eat said they were interested because we know that 's what tape is inge another great procedure to say hey we 're includes it so it was just start something as well there was there was three categories that you could put your name forward line was a bit foundation member second that first round appendix a silent so those councils are 21 were the one that one that said you will be vehicle for the foundation program which we want Emma spear to say live from New Zealand we 're surprised a min event overwhelmed by the number of our councils that put the name for the revision to creep in there me and what we 're suggesting this paper is basically let 's wait and see for those foods three councils because the moment is to an unknowing such a relation in terms of executives criteria are with their stay in the tent but not in the single bed rest years clarify through the team is making baked into villages now we not just a totally not one of the three for the pilot so we don 't have any my financial contributions or commitments at the stage because we 're in this week great okay and when was a pilot the assessment crisis was being finalized their next couple of months they would maybe october if things went well in terms of that first assessment round kicking off but year the lives of local government meddling this morning the Sun really 2017 it was also that foods to work should be not sure so they will make a decision at that point I 'm literally like okay all right thank you make you one happy that this reservation here 118 to kind of legal face the lies they don 't fuss with also don 't signal but everybody here because you can usually when a they have sir john 's yeah can I have a second difference good like a fancy say hi _"

Smith has put out a proposed EMPs but I think would be fair to say the officials acknowledge that there was still a lot of background research still being done so what we 're expecting us that will be dramatic change this in case once actually finalized by a minister at this point it 's primarily targeted of those high growth councils which is not going to include cover District Council but there are some elements of the we 've done is try to highlight those and express our goodness so again simply looking boo your endorsement basoski I support them and what you have written but I wonder whether we should in fact also mention that there is a significant high number of absentee homeowners which makes us somewhat different from virtually important other councils yeah we had quite a lot of discussion of the officials around there because one of the definitions that they were one of the aspects of the definitions that they were looking at and corporated not only resident population but also visitor numbers and we pointed out the practicalities of trying to one measure that in any meaningful way at a point in time but to the challenges of managing infrastructure around it so we we 've talked about those emissions and the challenges that those hoes for us given out q kiero Jesus music to be fair they were aware of that because they had quite a lot of dialogue with queenstown lake so runs have similar sorts of issues so it sitting on your right now so effectively you guys district yeah well who we just saw it as one of those areas introduces ambiguity it was going to be difficult to measure and there was no logical reason too heavily that the officials could actually raised you right okay thanks Nick and just a resolution of you on my bow one a chance to choose what else is true as a family say I certainly a strong guys remember team submission on local conduct these young local services the government continues its Henry and I think you 're all well aware that there has been an ongoing agenda with this national government around reform of local government sector this is simply another seat in our forum I guess if I was going to sum it up I would say it 's simply some more changes to broaden the toolbox if they 've got to consider future amalgamations of counsel or other alternative collaborative arrangements and it 's why there 's a lot of discussion in there particularly around C cos he will appear well really support without water CCOs_''_552.25 as being a primary target but this this piece of say creating in broadening their toolbox Thank You counsel kruszewski thank you hang on once gang is that look the minister has consistently called is proposed legislation and enabling piece of legislation but he really is failing to highlight the fact that it also disables current grassroots democratic rights without providing any guarantees or proof of greater efficiencies effectiveness or cost settings to rampant completely agree cooperate well at least one of the things we 're always mindful of when we are preparing a submission on your behalf is that you 've got both local government New Zealand and you top soldier and set representatives who are presenting information and we try very hard to avoid duplication of effort and so essentially what you will have seen at the beginning of our submission is with endorsed and our support for those two set of submissions and all that we 've tried to do is add a little bit of a top of nuance where we thought there was value in that now both those sectors submissions have come down very hard in terms of expressing their grave concern about the a need i estimate our respective to it additional comments however let me see that that their force you wish us to convey with more than happy to convey excellence the only the other thing mr. girl would be that we have asked to be good and focused emotions as it will be the sort of Google piscatorial you would also give me I guess that the other thing that I 'm looking for is a certain level of comfort that damn that it does not undermine our current and future good-faith negotiations with Maggie 24 hour on the 20 settlements that we can 't you have where whereby we may not be able to deliver on some of the aspirations that we may be agreeing on in good faith at the moment that 's um that 's a rather loaded question you 've given the clear in a public arena I easeful I guess what I would say is first of all the settlement with trooper two photos will be will be protected by legislation so that we have legislated legal protection which won 't be undermined by government to deliver on any future agreements what first point is those agreements can be reached at this point and secondly you will always be constrained as decision-making body by the limits of the legislation thing which you operate so if the local government acts is you can 't_''_763.529 do this you won 't be able to do that in the future even if you decide with two so they 're my irritants do which is the point that this counselor was making and the other thing of course is that it may not be over to councils to decide the future because a commissioner may decide that on our behalf curry which are very at once game brings us back to the democracy and I want the public by the gun intersection 27 of the Bill of Rights Act because you 're probably know that already I fully accept the Select Committee will be hearing a very strong message importance of local democracy and I think it will be important for us to the council to front that select committee and express vacancy so through the chair okay and vertebrae I 'm not wanting to duplicate the same point over and over again to the Select Committee and so we covered under solga etc I still think itself value and what we are related to do represent the comments that arguments may and I would like to see the separator now again just just to lay with a button we need to leave at the point x_._841.72 more than we do councillors they have you to do that more than have you prepare you some draft words which will circulate by email and hopefully we can get a consensus on base I think there 's no maple for down yet but I think we need to Winnipeg out and just reinforce offense what we are elected to do because in many ways it could almost be an amalgamation by stealth if you like too much still involved with the government operations okay let me say you happy to go away with this yes be strong yes I 'm candy with this okay all right thank you very much so suggested resolution than one husband they claim that they say hi snaps against Gary _"

    "text": "you know item number five extends under contract rate maintenance and resealing mr. Dennis Lewis worshiped as is I 'll take the item of strength but we 've just got a couple of things just to talk truly one of the reason for bringing this agenda item so really if the contract is not due until one July next year but should you decide not to a water to refer the year that we need some significant time to put together a team to document for their upcoming region that cuts in a point range straw that means the reason to bring it forward to today and certainly made mention of a recording of only the concave over for another 12 months on the basis that being able to incorporate within a new continent one league with globe place ification which is something that we 're even screwed with the moment to builder to our transport activity management plan so they would be happening concurrently if we would write a new contract we wouldn 't be able to write that component into you contract until we know what that 's won 't be finalized until around this time next year so my recommendation is that we do offer another improvement students of the project and just the last measure in terms of expenditure on transport Thabo district council has got one of the lowest cost per kilometer new rigs in the country there 's probably only two or three that area ballpark and seem to my target largely range that we do operate a very very low house networks and can 't_''_117.97 you can be sure that our cost society loi of the scale in fact they probably attract a little bit of attention because they are below e and skyping pinterest first ok any questions of sulu sea of people just where that suppose you could you just elaborate a bit more of your comments and i read what about yet the new go in RC will impact on levels of services provided by the contractor inflatable dinner the certainly thrown one network road classification as a national classification that will classify all roads according to the types 3 going from a local road local access road right up any of your local streets or local rural roads national strategic stay high web so that 's the best that the highest rating road within that classification there will be specific customer levels of service and technical levels of service that they currently being developed and the contractor will be required to provide that custom that level of service and give you an example currently and many road maintenance contracts they talk about the grass booms and how long they should be with alicia the 100 millimeters of 200 millimeters and the new levels of service that have talked more about lines of sight and maintaining long lines of sight rather than a specific length so it 's looking at outcomes rather specification how to do something to that would wreck contractor what they can or can 't_''_222.25 do is this degree is it true to say that this renewal of the contract is directly monitoring the level release than the last it 's not significantly it 's all the same way thank you this was the general standard private civil context at the moment at prices on a Friday Friday us and ask their question they collate all the information from contractors or from teams that have been released and unfortunately that information is not available we have another month six weeks so I don 't really have an answer for that I 'm sorry we should kiss okay I take it that the 2.75 is budgeted group and just under the financial the deceleration thats instead it 's estimated 2.75 it 's estimated so we 're not going to come back and needing more fully to speak but that would be the amount the reason that is estimated this because we haven 't got an accurate idea at the LC how many square meters of bigger we might need to do or how many slips my dagger or how many trees might fall down so that 's why we use it history ok cancel a place I see over the four-year period three times almost coupled in the total contract price for you you know it 's that nor is it yes their betters that is about the norm mr. Higgins existing contract the moment down in the performing well exactly improved the performance over the last two or three years the change of ownership is make no change it is very different I have no difference to the men on the ground we have detained six monthly performance review of the contract all right and you have a Christian some stress and this counselor pag you 're just one more so with with existing and contract with contractors are mean with the plus one do you have alter the health and safety component of a contractor as it as as it was concerning the legislature health and safety go with the health legislation some of the legislation changes then think we would change that to be fair sort of things that we ever meet the true this contract what they want some of it to walk please be patient of the univision okay can say i like to move the suggested reservation I think it does make sense in a new contract to the one road network approach the top to modern day so I 'm pleasure and we suggested washing their hands Thank You fascinating just thank you Miss Murphy detailed report all those in favor please say aye against Kerry _"

to talk to her at all rosy on well I think everyone does have a copier there anything identificate was decided terribly sorry but it was something I mentioned at the time that it was extremely a valuable trip and I think there 's a lot to be gained by it and there were meetings being held while we were actually a way to further negotiations for that mill that was thought had been shelved so that was still ongoing and we did whole hold an investor 's evening which I think there 's more to come from that as well so I mean it certainly was a real eye-opener for me as to how valuable I think future relationships are will current the relationships I was with China and there 's no doubt i don 't think it can be just done by email or i came back with a cold to be personal relationships and i think they have to be just enhanced by I further whatever it is you know it can 't_''_92.04 be it can 't_''_92.759 be just over phone email I think there has to be ongoing efforts made and we identified several areas where we need to make more efforts in creating things that the Chinese will want to do when they 're here we talked about restaurants we talked about all sorts of business ideas and various things which we are still discussing actually with various people and I think that will help get more tourists here more business opportunities here so I think it was a well with well worth going so that 's my opinion I think was really good and I think everyone who wins and the other the people that went on the trip as well the business all the ladies from the 224 eat our group you know gave me a good opportunity you actually get to know them better for future relationship sexually for other reasons so it was really really worthwhile I thought was great sorry Zane if one for you too okay thanks Rosie just right just while we 're on the topic in a public place talk about it but the risks that we were talking about this morning because we 've been involved in it Chinese issue nail aren 't we for that the OIA issue which concerns me about how we got our Brussels policy right give me our passage wrong information oh thank you very much counselors any other members reports all you gotta move the shiny all right just make the comment i 'm on the access committee we haven 't had a meeting to report on this month but we did last month i finally received the document that we spent 20 or 25 thousand dollars on where we had an order of the central business district for accessed a pie and what was interesting i won 't read the whole sydney nine pages just to point out some of the things this 745 residents and tap i have mobility parking permits at three point eight percent of the population 17 to 17.2 percent are aged 65 or over an increase the whole in New Zealand but what 's also interesting that they believe to cover the serious risks item from the survey is 175,000 yeah I believe it 's in staff hands whether they going to come back both Rosie and clear but it makes very very interesting reading so no doubt there 'll be document to the office for people to get oh sorry yeah I know and just wanted to UM I just wanted to say we hit the opening of the hour um Civic Center playground and my Aquino yesterday and it managed to stay the Sun minister shine 14 minutes or so Wow interpreter but yeah it was really great and well done various groups rolled with it relations here alright so just a suit of cheer yes Nelson doesn 't council may be aware of the ongoing issues we have lines company in philly its recent you crescendo this morning with a new zealand herald to an article is there was one of their business reporters ng today 170 something word article on the lines company and I Elizabeth angle said who as the communications what she 's put in the priests but it was very it wasn 't_''_323.87 a very good comment and i think the thism very angry responses to her comments and tv3 aren 't doing actually at the moment doing a follow up on it so oh I 'm glad that it 's finally taken some traction because we 've been battling the lines company in Turangi with sorry with the support of the community board since about two thousand and seven maybe earlier and um dos a bet lean or a ton enhance discussion well enhance discuss things on the community board side battling on the community side I would think that would be how the community and see it and and it is it is needing to me to be worked through and I think that um the more exposure it gets the more that the two parties can will actually come and have those discussions that are necessary um entering it it 's like it 's the surprising pricing methodology it is used no no Rosie has its total it 's the way the lines company makeup their demand and over the wintertime they do six periods where they take the peak that you have used of your power and they average it out and you are charged that peak for the whole year we 've got people into any who get 60 power bills but are paying 120 dollars in loans charges it 's in the loans company need to when they are controlling as when they are looking at the peaks and they have got widgets and a map that tell people when they 're controlling so that you can turn everything off and but that also means that people get cold and don 't cook their dinners on time and things like that but that 's that 's the issue is that those those devices that give that are there for you to use or not and then you take your it and so you can think it 's okay the lights green I can cook my dinner and actually it 's not and you so you will get peaked and the amount of conversations and houses entering you about power prices is incredible it people into any we 've got young families and tyranny and we 've got business people and to any who are suffering through this and it 's been very difficult to get the message out to the rest of New Zealand because to get an understanding of what the pricing is doing to people it 's really hard we 've been to a slit commercially thing look the community when I say we I mean the community have been to the slit committee and they came out with the thing that it 's legal well we knew it was legal when we went in with that um debate to ask them to look at this it 's the moral Elizabeth angle something Elizabeth angle she came out this morning on the paper and see that the problem would soon be gone because our people who complain at old and I 'll be dead soon Oh so much that 's what it wasn 't good to say that that 's it that 's how she put really I 've asked with her resignation because of a no-go area and make comment are going to sit up and take notice and I 'm I tell x times have been collecting people 's bills power bills and lines company builds and they are putting together an article about this to which will be coming out soon and to do help the to any community get your message out that they are hurting and thank you to machines and everything yes thank you me dude much appreciated so to see you sorry Rosie but yeah it 's not worth a small question it 's a big sleepy ocean its office in addition solutely p yeah yeah alright just a resolution

    "text": "item number five Rights resolution 2016 and 2017 so is so is carry on from the annual plane this allows you to authorize in sorry provides for your rates and charges and authorizes counsel to assist those rates and charges in charge late payment penalties so Tony will answer any questions that you have on this item is is noted there are a series of resolutions and it takes you through takes you through those resolutions which relate to information and our funding impact statement okay any questions right thank you worship I 'm just a point of clarification for me and it relates back to white and we 're watering in Sorenson like a broken record how are you going to account for how you 're going to distribute those charges across the widest scheme as this project unfolds because obviously it 's not included in here at the moment are you going to have a separate fund how how you 're going to manager like sorry could you repeat the question why do I know a water when we actually start constructing and we 've got costs that that and change the water rate charges for the type of water scheme how is that going to work sure okay um basically the same as any other capital project so the project itself will be funded like we do a kettle in this case that would be of million dollars roughly alone and the balance is funded by the ministry whole subsidy to a value somewhere in the vicinity of three million overall so we 'll raise alone for that million dollars and the interest flows will then go back against the tapos scheme likewise any maintenance and depreciation costs over time in terms of when the rate will first change for in term consolidate it will actually depend on the completion of the project at this stage I think that will likely be 1819 will be the first time we see that consolidated because the project will run over 16 17 and 17 18 financial years and you can only set the rates once a year you can 't vary them during the year so at this stage the first time for a consolidated rate will be 18 the total debt owing on the scheme and the on the Talpiot how I said that is correct yeah yeah so not too dissimilar to for example we spent 27 million dollars over the road so the interest cost and the maintenance costs on them obviously spread across at a by right pace I guess I sort of asked the question and just asking assess how will just maintain some visibility on on it all as it goes into the washing machine that is that every single project that we have for Council has its own funding line and whether that be funded by loan whether it be funded by reserve every single project we do has a funding line and and it 's yes we aggregate all those numbers up from an annual plan point of view but we also have have it all keeps down at that low level so we know exactly what letters Neil what sort of interest rate currently we 'll be looking at for a million dollars we 're looking around weighted average around five point eight something like that moment across the entire so I guess we need to probably a little bit of clarity around that because that 's the big perch overall if we were to go ahead and raise a new individual debt now it varies but we when we talk about funding council we talk about it that they 're the total level like I said there 's there 's a range of interest rates across all the other loans of the council depending on when they 're raised in the market conditions at the time they were all raised so someone 's always ten years ago some five years ago so if I were to go out and raise debt today on standalone on an individual project it would be a lot less than that but we do a weighted average cost across all of Council we know where you live all right Jim just clarification on the rates remission for what is it snowy water even though it may be 2018 before it comes on part of the 1617 year annual plan includes those rate remission it 's hypotheticals you said they 're not going to exist is enacted from 1617 but there won 't be any eligibility force until 1819 so I was getting the framework in place this is where I find the difficult in here and having to vote okay just another Cara fication if somebody is a councillor votes against the annual plan and then votes for the policy on rating is it null and void the two separate documents so the policy itself is a standalone policy that you 've already adopted and then the in your plan is a standalone document as well all right all those in favor please say aye okay thank you very much Tony immaterial item number six Thank You mr. Mia I 'm sorry but very brief and then hand over to to you to ask any questions that you may have just a couple of things to point out first one obviously is that we are very nearly at the end of the financial year Hince you 'll see some of the projects and the service delivery when the risk the report of performance tuning Reed and I say that sister of future the fact so those projects which we 've talked about this but as the years gone on obviously now look like they read because some because we clearly aren 't going to complete them bother by the end of the financial year and any other things I point out is obviously the big-ticket items that we starting now as starting the discussion on freedom camping end of note that we put some Facebook commentary out on the weekend I think we 've got the largest e of a reach of their Facebook marketing that we 've ever had 9,000 odd reached 9,000 people and a large number of comments came through so so there 's obviously hitting a nerve out there in the community likewise kinloch we 're out there at the moment I 'm undertaking the consultation that you 've approved and it 's getting a little bit of localized feedback and Kanak and other points to note is that we 're still working with the three waters contractor which is is going to be starting at the 1st of July Athena Dumas and so there 's a big bit of getting there caught the new contractor up to speed with all of our processes and procedures and the other big one at the moment is dog registration so if you see the ladies downstairs confessor will be because a lot of people will come in and paying their dog registration fees and it always brings out the best in people and so over met I 'll leave it to to any questions that you may have no we haven 't received a legal challenge we received a letter from one of the from a lawyer on behalf of one of the properties which has just been replied to by a solicitor with you in your dissent in success that this correlates with an overall decrease in the number of tap of visitors for the year today the numbers have increased not decrease [Applause] yeah I think I think the word museum is missing from that as opposed to the global visitors concern its visitors sorry visitors to the museum that have decreased not visitors to total so we differentiate for the museum is one of our few facilities we differentiate tennis pay so this thing there 's a word difference there for the chair just in comments and questions are six page six bio one just under food on your tongue do really bored just wanted to say that you don 't say it enough I 'm John keep perspective start big thanks to the pool staff will be in that pool hall but I did and also to Greg and in and in it I appreciate everything they 've done I mean we 've quite quickly to know any other piece of stuff they don 't know once a week Thanks sure thank you please pass it on moving through to six bar for under all food read orange dot short can contract according to assist with the remaining food audits might be something I might be missing that wasn 't you at last council meeting but I 've been saving ending it in those minutes are we behind those you need the insulation but through the chair we 're in the process of trying to catch up we wrote down on staff so we 've got a couple and achieve what we did on that page discussion with our beam doors are ongoing to upgrade the system [Music] highlights not current issues fixed by one for highlights novena current issues as its discussions without beandoor how I 'm going so we 're looking at so they 're CIT systems so we 're looking at our IT systems and as totality and more brimstone be to enjoy food not very good six bar 24 and the Groupon pay Vince I know that today Poe pounding competition was the biggest city of a head I think it 's right that we write a letter of thanks to the organizers from Council to say that we really appreciate the effort they 've done they do it for love of their district and of their the past time and the last thing I wanted to ask was how its briques it what 's that Tesco she is with you talking about England Bing lemonade the European soccer that was selling to 162 but they got rid of the coffee business so they should go up they cancer cousins the bricks finance method think it 's too early to tell really yesterday for example the Asian market we nap overnight the British market went down the pound still falling I think it 's pretty much a wait-and-see I suppose and parents give just just to clarify on six bad 12 and under emergency management its if the white Kanto region has adopted the workplane and it 's the its adopted the proposed great plan it won 't be finalized until they 've been better if he goes back any other questions of the Acting CEO in which I 've talked to mr. rhythm just agreed about it relates to Unison 's to do the lights it 's Scott here they 've kept the price of twenty nine thousand last month they see at 21 and then the country has been awarded for the summer of 142 it was a tone of one seven nine thousand in sorry sorry showing one seven nine thousand is now last month one seven one mister it has an explanation yeah there 's a couple of issues here the the cost of the job is one seven one read 200,000 when the the budget was adopted in March that was the budget that was resolved by council so I need to correct that for the next news reporter so it should read two hundred thousand we still receiving the complimentary generator or it 's not complimentary I think it was cost-sharing so the cost sharing is capped at 29,000 from unison so yeah really very mr. chairman just hanging up with this degree now so budding either the list of we Gators eleven this month these ten and it transpires that the document to do with the white anui water isn 't included this month and mr. green had a reason for them I 'm so essentially you 've just signed that off so so it 's no longer approach it because you 've decided off the investigation part of it but it will become a new project now that you have approved up turned into the future so will wouldn 't it be better if lifted until we 've approved it and then taken it out of course of course as I guess but but it 'll for the future so now show next month is a free kick thank you yeah so will him some it 's really cheered so you don 't have any concerns poor country just cure us firstly looking at page 6 by 24 regarding pool membership get a budget it 's 53,000 K is it just a sea of bars or was it three pools on page six bucks now 44h and gym membership there head of just ducking up on that that 's it that 'll be the district figure this one one more question to ask somebody a request actually yep just councillor Cousins has raised the issue of a our disco she is it sometimes as we add a print here of what our sheer portfolio was doing I 'd like to see staff preps give us what we 've done from 1st of July last year to through the June this year in regards of income I know we 've had some different repayments or payments made on those years but I like to see how they 're tracking particularly those that we 've made heavier for that 's what I 'd have to but I would like to see I think the exchange rate would 've but time yeah I just see we 're we 're tracking for the last four months appear on the citizens we had they done further on the equities on the all of that information is that she forms part of the annual report so we could do a separate report or you could just wait until you get the annual report because all that stuff we have to disclose any rate through the annual report but not talking us let 's watch it we 're do a separate report and what many aspects of equities which we have been very restrained about is the actual dividend yield with the way the interest rates are at the moment the dividend yield is often greater than the investment you investment year but as period we shot this morning on our risk profile we have a very low risk profile so therefore we have been very conservative in that regard just as a mr. chairman the last one that I saw and taking 're now worth the number of cheers and the dividend returns in here they thought to be helpful as well all right okay all right this recommended resolution on six by four containing the acting Thank You councillor John and seconded by Councillor cousins all those in favor please say aye yes Harry _"

    "text": "item number three is the reason charges 2016-17 year this is Ariel King afternoon Ariel good afternoon good afternoon so this item allows Council to adopt the fees and charges for 2016 17 and also allows council to adopt the responses to those submissions that are made on the proposed fees and charges for 2016 as you know there was to sort of two parts that process wonder is the animal management in environmental health fees excuse me that you discussed at the end of May and then these the other fees and charges which you can now consider so there any comments or questions thanks Cyril I 'll move that they be accepted all that was read in our black so they appear to be corrected me okay what so you can move down zoom one else want to comment or do we call for a second to place into by councillor Harvey you have a favorite discussion I just got one one question I raised probably six months ago the climbing wall which we decided in long-term plan to continue with an at the time I think mr. was not much information that we could require money whether we could have a full report by the July but secondly the August meeting as we 're meeting the first week of august i think victory for that next meeting so we can actually see how it 's tracking to the decisions we made the long term plan if that 's possible please thank you can sweaty you ever question some queries on that item I couldn 't be moved and seconded all those in favor please say aye is against carried I to number for adoption of the annual play in 2016 2017 Ariel as you know we 've been to a process to develop the in your plan for 2016 it included the meadows that we consulted on in the consultation document we have deliberated on those submissions and you have made some decisions which are now included in the in your plan which you have before you so this item allows you to adopt there in your plan and it also allows you to adopt the responses to the submissions which were considered out of scope in respond to the submitters who made a submission and regards to the water her know a proposal so that 's the purpose of this item okay thanks cereal any questions of aerial or any comments sure there 's a couple of things that in the annual plan it 's only some words that have been missed out there 's only four of them three of them page 12 I don 't notice as I went through it if we look at page 12 to start with its water schedule capital expenditure and it talks about wtp upgrade to meet it doesn 't actually state where it is or bulk me two flows what Bob me please not include-- it 's actually in case you may further in the document those areas where it actually is happening such as security of supply it 's hard to be but it 's not mentioned so within turn to page 21 that 's very similar so the optimizations acacia babe monitoring boards can lock like that and then the last one is 32 there 's someone when they might read it thank you ya locations and what there 'll also be a mind I mean but to those tables to include down the bottom of all of them that that 's a total so one of the things i should point out as the ish this document will only look very slightly different when it 's published what it looks like now and it would because include pictures and things like that but it won 't change any of the content that we will add those locations and to the capital expenditure schedules against each group of activities if you to the page 32 and us right at the bottom rate it relates to renewals further on the document that support services software etc so if those words nor to get it thank you suski thank you your worship them I raised this matter informally before and I 'm not sure whether it is the right format or whether we are going to discuss this later on just wondering whether what my fellow councillors are thinking about that point on page 29 the fourth bullet point whether we should leave that in there or time good use baby refreezing circles little what 's are you explain your reasoning well as I said in my emails to you it 's the first time that it appears there is a no provision in our funding impact statement forward and it hasn 't gone out to any consultation documentation whatsoever so would but I know it 's a method that is it 's going to crop up later on in a debate so maybe something for so if you want to if you want to change it now is the time because some once you adopt the annual plan then then it 's too late is what we spoke about on that email it 's whilst it 's in near the legislation will come and if it doesn 't its current form in in force things through but whether as in here or not it won 't make any difference to their process so we are in your hands in terms of that except that it could be interpreted as Dark Council has discussed the matter rather than being a legislative requirement which is outside of our GI thinking of counsel constructio suppose a point in regards probably more appropriate to be and then next long-term plan I just I would support that his is concerned on they won and I 'd agree with counselor Bernard as well sorry so are you referring to the development the total catchment document that 's the one you 're referring to so that was an hour long term plan for 16 17 in an expert some information or reddit so I guess we would feel more comfortable with that could we please have something recorded in the minutes s to the reason why because it was on the long-term plan and so now effectively we 're removing it through this process so i just want that recorded so there 's a reason against it you going to move that will be adopted down i 'm running with you to give due consideration to standing order three point nine point five in regards of the chairperson or any member may require emotion expressed and parts to be decided in parts now that 's not necessary in parts these parts of the of the annual planner don 't support part of it is the rates statement in regards of the remission for whites tanui water so I don 't happen during the major event of land value versus capital Valley where one member abstained and others voted but were unhappy with one part of it wasn 't handled in two parts I 'm not sure as this isn 't broken up more than it is now it 's just the end your pain responses to submissions otherwise I 'm just going to so bleak no further clarification can mr. green explain to me why because I 've asked this before but it couldn 't be done and I think the sea okay back to seniors who could after the event so during an annual plan a long-term plan you can 't take resolutions and parts but he can to do with any other resolution on Care Council so in terms of what happen with the long-term plan last time was that sorry not sure thinking 2012 or like and but even in the 2015 long-term clean we need a set of resolutions wanted to take with their long-term plan and then when we came back to you in June you actually adopted the long-term planets and a top in its entirety and I think you made the call at that stage I 'm just trying to remember no no I can 't remember and so I think that 's um and then if you like what has happened with the senior players will hit their deliberations process where you 've decided which way you would set on each resolution that we hear that their process but now you need to make a decision as to whether you want to drop the in your plane that 's entirely on the particular student worksheet include would be reviewed in three years time anyway content process the be a part of part of that is so in the bottom line is that we do need a resolution saying that the annual plan has adopted so that then we 've got something to be able to see at the rate on essentially so that does need to be a single resolution you know partly in your be adopted in ass entirety or not not the fear that it was my guess is John sorry I just threw the cheer I know too that the next agenda item which is when we discuss the rates resolution there isn 't actually a resolution on that item they are sort of linked together am I dismissing the resolution on that next item or two when we get there as everything from page 5.1 where it says recommended resolution all the way through it 's a series of resolutions for that one so that 's a second one big long resolution as long as resolution of the year oh sorry okay so it 's quite a nice that 's a very long as unusual but we need to do in order whether when we get to that item but we have to do that to meet the legislative requirements opposite in the right Sofia what you 're saying do the end your pain but the funny impact statement is to be part of their resolution so on three years mr. Chu is oh so as I 'm reading a council annual plan whilst an eight includes the race but then item five refers specifically to the rate so surely could probably vote against the right num number five item the vote for the annual plan well I 'd unfortunate i can do that because i 'm opposed to the white stirs newer water was just part of the india planned it makes its decision on yeah I 'm vest aerial but this has got to be adopted in East entirety will be in class go through the question of clarification we have the consultation document into a guards of five mile Bay so if I 'm de nuit this is spurious more figures we said that the annual rate would be for 59 near the ND rate has come in at four five six now we 're also told and documentation that if no one word to nuit extra over that 36 picked up to go on the scheme we would be facing and then got my water supply scheme another eight got a 60 on that target breaks this comes in from the first of July but it 's set up a construction so until that point we won 't be um rating people for the additional cost so someone could decide to come on in the next 12 months if we 're that good and getting it done and not pay and theoretically yes but I don 't think it 's likely for that type of a swift construction if i 'll be voting on the water supply for the top post game at five whatever it happens to be 54 56 Zachary thank you okay were you going to say something then here or did you know that 's all thank you all right any other questions or queries okay there 's a reckoning resolution Leah that we 've got the annual plan do I have a move please Blue Castle anything similar by counseling and just to confirm us at all one package yeah you know like speaking of favor you know like to speak against I don 't_''_866.8 this will miss even see me and 12 coming okay I 'm being moved and seconded who 's moved by Councillor names don 't signify counselor heckling no cousins should I call for a division please the division place CEO for the resolution cancer kruszewski well seeing I wasn 't here for two deliberations I think it would be unfair for me to make a call with one way or another and therefore I have to abstain standing yep kelso javi thought oh yeah yes no resolution is passed _"

'll give you a full update and you wish to pass plays I should just report that I did need two delegations from China while you was in China two quite different groups to be perfectly honest Chloe you 'll see a letter the corns got into and they imported a contingent in September or free of charge to our food an arts festival in their city but I did point out it was close to the election so but I think we ought to acknowledge that to vary quite different the second one there was seventeen businesspeople male and female there was probably half of that contingent was either the mayor or deputy mayors of those province and the cities within the problem they were in the North Island for 10 days and the South Island for 10 days so that 's 20 days I think that 's pretty unusual through for a delegation from China that there was definitely interested in business opportunities that 's really all all contingents one at a population of 10 million and the other other population of 15 million small place and and we look at our pristine Lake and I think to myself if we had 15 million people living around the lake what would it be here is a like China anyway it was it was it was quite interesting through the chief does not direct peps directly representing Council which is to acknowledge because Ric 's counts Rick Swartz being a formal account former council the passing of his wife sir walking Souza they grow contributed the two journalists at will help over the over 50 years went to a funeral one last Thea Sterling was Queen to this day yes it was good to nearly quite a long time 15 terms Oh 15 years I mean easier and he was also original counsel all right I 'd like to say certainly the China to me I think was very valuable of this oil retiring and we certainly had a lot of a lot of good would come from now we get a lot of ball business people and investors and kal ho itself and there are more visitors that are going to be coming here and I think there 's no doubt that we definitely on their radar and to actually be there mixing live them had a huge advantage that 's actually no doubt to actually face to face with these people they were very appreciative of that and you know we just understand more about them in their culture and just huge value and then I think no doubt about it and they just really do like New Zealand and you know just to meet with the the first day we were there any was just very very busy and very belong to the first stable area I 'm just meeting with the people from Shanghai English and Pakistan set brushes cheek the toner I mean that the fact that it was a Sunday and they put on a full absolutely full presentation for us but every well near I think that shows just how valuable ethical relationships are because I was pretty nice by death and everything need to Negro when we were treated just extremely there 's more business to come from it Fritz was there as well and is working on through the week ending relationships and a business opportunity and it 's just steps of your mania I think it 's differently business to come for the district so I 'm very appreciative of the opportunity I there 's no substitute for actually eyeballing equals from the desperate all school and you 'll be pleased to know you can still have you win over your bill terms of ice means the counselors advice means I comprised me after all the advice me and say yeah yeah funny predicting jealous it 's been a lot of Chinese banquets thousand tourists opportunity once the first roller on the first passenger will be an exciting moment for this district really really exciting so they committed to that and that means a lot for our accommodation providers our Terms to operators and a shoulder season which is no one normally here so it 's going to be good so we 'll give you a full full full report Rosie 's right there that purse wheezing night with I Gareth came along as though that implant clay and era ops team and the organization as we know plays with child to be able to do an international trip I then magnitude and that diary to organized other technology because your day started early and didn 't finish the late and writing notes and speeches and just constantly your organization skills are quite amazing so I learnt a lot more about a decent camera to show you the Taj of the delegation was how many 1598 hola and just execute name very important to you there 's entertain some people who have never traveled before and they 'll officer offer Cruden going through the language would you know you did get a picture into

    "text": "I 've number 12 he was empty exactly doctor 's report at the time type yeah I 've got very little to add to the report I guess anything that I would point out is that you 'll note through the performance report that a lot of categories are flip them to either an orange or read and status compared to two last month in previous months and primarily this because at the time of the year the financial year that we 're read we 're getting very close to the end of their financial year so projects which officers previously thought might have another scraper and have a fairly not been able to and most of those we know the individual circumstances you will be aware of of all of those in fact and so examples like the white under water treatment which we 've been talking about for some time you 've got deliberations coming up in those other ones which are identified on page 12 1 which you should be we are of those individuals so that 's the only thing I point out to you it got the officers in the room who can answer any questions Thank You mr. green even just toolbar 3 and I 'm sorry nobody it 's green Aidan rated you before was up a potent event the comments made about white canary that there were four people in favor of the water going down there and won against but when I reread the submissions which I 've got with me here I found one two three four five and favored one of them being the Ministry of Health in one two three four five six seven again so I 'm just wondering because we arrived at I 'm pretty sure those figures would have come at the time of writing is probably unfortunately we put the money like that and there was probably before the close of the submission period so you have the submissions in front of you they are the numbers and so there is an area of what 's on there that was written before the last less emissions carry on very pretty mr. Chairman I took us up with Mr Man hannath pricing counsel and regards has been a change from what we 've been getting regards of fees and charges in other reviews and there 's been no Billy probably correctly and regard some fees and charges been put into other reviews and it relates to other petrotech infringement defines so that was a change there just come back to my favorite color paper just me getting used to have my sunglasses off when I look at it just one thing it 's on am starting getting used to the camera have the presentation your worship the same each page each time rather then the changes that we see so it makes it easier to follow on a month-by-month basis we will kill it consistent for the rest of you just average that page 1 of last month 's and this is page 1 of this month it 's just the consistency of venality you did just on that through the cheer we put the addition of a dish or summary in there to try to give you a summary on the first page like and a lot of our business we try to improve that 's the reason for them but now I think going forward from now hopefully we 've settled on something that you find useful it 's two words like wait okay any other questions cancer kruszewski just a couple of questions 12 power 3 relates back to Whitehall New Year water and we 're saying that consultation with residents is continuing I was still consulting with the residents at the stage I 'm not as we speak but we will post your decision making so I 'm so off to the project hasn 't been completed whoever made those decisions and then post decision-making there 'll be a whole lot of discussion which needs to happen whichever way you go in your decision making an elastic clarification for me is on 1238 and that the monthly treasury management report landing facilities we have issued an aberrant 775 million of working way and notes actually our gross debt Oza know that some securities that backs up the dead so you always have securities in addition to the actual physical dead so there 's just some security set Cynthia so it 's tavern 75 correct it 's around 148 at the moment okay russia yes i haven 't page 12 for 12 just under dogs under the current issue the last paragraph will that strategy be an internal one office one or will it be will it come to the thread committee or on the dangerous dogs so this reduce the way i 'm done the public inflation is so you have seen some more input in the papers locally locally around understands so it 's bit more of a subtle way of just communicating with the public about what your responsibilities are without being too hard in people 's faces and just a mobile sony reports you may notice it we 've got 19 i 'm tina dogs registered very up to 40 dogs now the district now register which i think is most stoic right ever so in terms the word compliance guys are doing with the widest strategy about getting compliance or dog education as being very successful quiet my question sign so now let me get at this stage we see with a room with back to the 'm dealing with the strategies of dogs and plots and still aren t to bring it back out of them that we continuing with work and chili and extremely in the meantime thank you okay okay so Harvey so it 's it 's a mixture of old and new stuff it before me it 's not just another strip so here I am Bourbon Street meeting on Friday and murderer which was all of the region and it 's consistent across the country what was seen other pass the country 's is taking people surround to get a building concede they just kind of doing the work without consent we 're still showing building consents and about eight days one of the fastest in the country but yeah it 's like everything it 's you 're always chasing tail all the stuff it will look at some strategies around infringement sand a bit but a better action so that people are going through the right prices to do it rules well that 's qualified builders during the work a lot of the time doesn 't I know all too well who did some work and pretty much said hey I in a quiet period for my team for a couple of weeks I needed a farm building built on my farm size women did it it was behind the whole I never thought anybody would notice we just happened to be doing and speaker on the property next door notice than so so yeah it 's it 's it 's will continue work on SF and that is where again as we do more product a work i would expect to see more of those things coming to your teaching his Rangers Rangers from complete house has been built without consent right through to people unknowingly doing a piece of work zone but a plumbing and not knowing that you can see in innocently not know even seen was needed so it 's a sort of year extremes really doesn 't think the sale to donate so you 're crazy donor say yes a lot of sales you know and conceded work so that 's the sort of education process and sell it done yep complete this out with the thinking you 've been to the role of the lakes near month Nana yeah and thank you thanks for the information you 've been sending through and all that sort of thing no other queries just just one quick one for me just just um seats chick we 're still on track for an operating surplus for the end of the year sorry if we take out the budgeted income and respect of the wata new you we and you compare apples with apples

    "text": "right so item number teen read some freedom camping laughter and Jane and neck okay Christian 's so we just wanted to close it for a little while as it all what 's your time frame well that 's up to you so what 's the timeline timeline of a meeting set will be closed over the summer period to be good it 's an option you would insert is clear your favorite workshop which we held in April Mary Jane 's highlighted those tables gems in the statistics require short time frame design it will be part of the summer which are under more pressure than others however closing it for parts of the summer and leaving it open for others can also be quite a challenge from the communications as well what do you show on the table it 's one option for you an alternative is you simply leave it as slaves quo or look at perhaps some management options but I know a number of management options can try to pass and I had always been too successful it 's a real challenge and in some Williamson you think you Jane Lee totally this obviously big problem here right through the country and turf there 's no exception Bishop being essentially you know gateway I said before the Gateway to north or south so it 's only going be going to be bigger a bigger problem future more question is obviously again just my thoughts is obviously if there 's a proposal to carry them or it another reserve management pendants are taking other ten months and again involving a so working pod you can turn just to get a better understanding all of the various stakeholders and where they are sitting cetera and within with care with counselors who they may be wouldn 't it be on the obviously there are accepting this hero issues down the other police and council resources monitoring it with compliance is always going to be as always miss you with well through the district alot of it aspects of policies and plans but wouldn 't it be better to keep the chemical open over the summer and just monitor heaven deploy somebody will we spend all the money with doubt the reality is is neither a negative aspects of district you can 't avoid so that 's going to take human resources money or the scene if the great masters of bite the bullet when will start for example as my thoughts ever going to be monitoring that particular reads farm why have it empty and go to another as their manager plan seems but pointless to me Chester and with reads fam if I remember rightly in April when we had the workshop the police were saying that their major issue with Ruth farmers between christmas and new year that 's their major problem time with reads farm no I don 't think it 's just but that is though that is the highest point of that 's what I gather from what they were telling us right yeah i 'm i am pretty much in mind of weird councillor Williamson is coming from that I can understand closing it over winter because it 's not a terribly exciting place to stay little of winter it 's freezing but how do i personally think if you 're going be done while it 's open so three of us that even maybe a suggestion if you look at page teen or if we started page on the ice cream you 'll see there and the the third paragraph from the bottom at the fourth paragraph and the moment talks about the current measurement plan wished his provision for the place to be closed from the first of may through the 30th or September there 's a CD to allow the rehabilitation of the site and I think if you go to only today you will see that it 's something you dire need of some fix up and we used to do that we did that up until two thousand eleven with the rugby world cup so hasn 't been closed since then so a suggestion if I 'm picking up the the vibe of the room properly is is that we could close it just for that period better do that maintenance and reopen it again on on the first of October and then locate some additional monitoring and enforcement through that two-week Christmas period which is the you remember Tony jurcins discussion and here at the same time depending on where you get to with the risk the item would be doing the reserve management plan and that could give us anywhere you know the all options are on the table in terms of that reserve management plan of course but it buys you that at time to be able to do that work so that is that what I 'm here yeah message on once i 'm just-just through this year I mean I think it 's really good that we 're finally talking about some of these issues regarding freedom camping my main concern when I read the papers are currently stood was the time that it was going to take to work through this process and from what I 've seen and anecdotal evidence and just being round and in the community this issue was actually wider than just reads firm and some of our reserves and my primary concern was if we close reads farm down then we are we not transferring the issues to some of our other partners to deal with our tourism is growing and so where are all these people going to go if we close down reads farm and I 'm also just really concerned too about how long we 're proposing to do this so i would really urge us and you just start and raise the challenge to find a way that we can work through the sooner rather than later i think in some ways we 're about behind the eight ball on it and I just really would like us to well this is a real priority to get sorted for our tourism industry for our communities experiences because we need the community support for tourism and you know we just don 't want to be moving problems around and I guess too if we are going to close rate farm over winter as if there are people down there that we 're using it for home we just need to work with some of our agencies to make sure these people yeah yeah thank you 33 wish I went down yesterday there 's two there are two teens down there but there were and colleagues so they would be shamed with nexus point for them as well you wouldn 't be stopping them using that note okay I think the general cos strangers alluded to here general consensus is that house it just supposed to maintenance and some pieces until what date did ESI September as what 's in the current medical get in there and have a good good good jolly old time tidy up and do the review of the plane as well in conjunction to have an open first of presence of 200 once well done they make maxpreps look mr. October leave that date a bit flexible so we did I mean normal councils resolutions and you would be you 'd be doing the Bible anyway and you 'd be doing the ministry plan and mind cancel John 's comments about doing that as soon as possible i guess that could be interesting just ever check through the counselors to to that time frame and what that is but then we only flows reads farm for their maintenance period to be in if nothing else that puts us consistent anyway and we 've always done it traditionally so it 's not new that 's what we 've always done and maybe i could make the suggestion that we get that working group together sooner rather than later and we 've very careful of who it is that we get around the table to have those conversations i think those people around that table are really really important that we get the right people and maybe what we initially first do is look at what some of the key risks are going to be with what we progressing to do so we can maybe work out some strategies collectively tackle some of those issues that may arise through this process just adding to that is that to me at least there 's an added issue which is the river we talk about read span but there are person if you like a flow-on effect which is the river and that contaminants are going there and the clean or the lack of cleaning up of the river a big the side of it and all that kind of thing and all the review not just average farm completely agreed the Redstone very outdated policy document um it needs a full overhaul and as part of that I was bullying the games from the cupboard oh I know have some aspirations to that area so it 's having those conversations with all the stakeholders tends to take the time and policy development process we originally looked at trying to cram all of this in the free short space of time the same connection so needless opinion what that was going to me was the window at the time space and evidence of conversation in as officers we were going to be concerned that they would attention impact on the quality of the focus of me because you 'll be doing it with insufficient information and not necessarily understand reviews of those players then I we propose that time frame of which to be my system ambition but we think if we throw some real time and energy and reasons yeah and further that I think if we have some key goals over that teen month period that we can work to that everything together in 10 months time I mean there is some quick when 's we can possibly get on board as we work through this process just under working party which I liked the idea and just just a clarify the elections looming how do you overcome the continuity should one or two of the elected councillors no longer being canceled I should be mighty zovem answer the question so you put a couple of councils on this working group post post the election of those councils get sick like any of your committees or groups that you 've got the new council can either decide to carry those councils over for continuity or put new councillors own or mix of those two things and we 've done that time and time again after every triennium say it 's one of those things that we 're conscious of but we deal with it after the post-election for the body clarification of way the resolutions are worried is we 're going to set up a working party is that to do the bylaw or to find out what 's going on from rob henderson yesterday I believe been in the council 's hands for a couple of months why we weren 't circulated that certainly shows the problem that we 've got around the lake so I think we finance that you 've had those photos all those photos of the year and that would be the type of information that that working group would be looking at in terms of sorting out what the solution is you 've you and your workshops have really identified that there was a problem and that you need to deal with it and you 've identified that our freedom camping by laura 's the best way of doing that what those specific provisions are we don 't know and that 's where the working group will will use things like mr. Henderson 's information like their knowledge that the other groups and individuals have and pull that together to then come back to you as a full council or the recommendation saying here 's what we think you should do then mr. chairman clarify the recommended resolutions and resolution three with drinks drinks offers out because they need help doing a bible the way kinda district councillor just last month here 's the era camping by a long time but would give to you to help you in your endeavors because it 's already been done you have a copy premium there 's also information from the Queen 's town just three councils will you be aware of those is the issue mr. chairman is dead and bylaws are quite a specific process which is set up under the local government act and you need to go through a process which includes setting the legal need for a Bible or so whilst we have knowledge in on a workshop situation you acknowledge that there 's a need for a bottle and to meet the legal tests you need to go through and first establish that you need a vial or data by laura 's the most effective way of doing it now I think we all know what all their views are on NEX we 've talked about it in the workshop but in terms of the resolution this is saying you don 't that work along with those other parties have an interest in us to bring something back so what you 're saying is right and those other model bylaws that other councils have used will come into the pot and be used as part of what they didn 't come up with and mischief through you can I ask doesn 't the 2011 freedom camping at X estate the need for a bylaw creates the opportunity for a viable 10 I guess just going on in previous comment the message that I would really like to emphasize is that a freedom can 't_''_987.62 I will reply talk anyone tell me we 're dealing with a very complex issue it 's not only our men but men are owned by the family compo currently dia other parties area you will govern by different pieces of legislation very important that we look at the whole suite of tools as a way of managing as they should not simply check out one particularly talking about the Bible next internet and resolving and could i seduce through the chair to that maybe the scope of central government for funding as regards our infrastructure we know that there 's a pool of money coming up shortly criteria yet to be determined but if we run this alongside there I think we should include it in the scope of this working group because that might be another one of our tools in our toolbox you need to Chancellor 's all right so i recommended resolution just this resolution we need we need two counselors together this week and group you could have more if you wanted more sorry have I got any volunteers I 'll be happy to do it as long as we get moving soon please sweet suggestion mr. chairman was just as a suggestion to my colleague II am the freed command he deals with reserves would it be an audio committee to you to report back you don 't need yeah it 's five the problem is that you 're going to end up with quite a bit committee because we 've got all of those parties which I which we 've identified so you wanted to stall to be a manageable group committee you know it 's a that 's a vision would turn roll up the sleeves can get involved in things who 's King crystal ski Stewart just yeah buddy how come it here I i think i think the staffs recommendation of toe is really what we should be aiming for so if it 's too many i will bow out because i think it 's better we keep this team lean but i 'm over over to the group likes to say there 's something for you something from the other end of the lady i think needs to be on on there to represent the other end of the lake here we remove my name from the list please worship cancer John no disrespect yep ancestor that I 'm just thinking it is quite oh cool centric and are they were district and I just did what what could sit here when we go to close us will be displacing some people so really I really want on really quite a couple about that so I 've really got to be handled really really well bye I 'll give the local queries and because it does even though John went down the eastern this than the Peter beanie black hacia I really have a concern that we might be displacing some locals that could be and so this is an option or ixia that yeah just United where then need to be a bit so I guess you 're making the decision to close reads farm if what i hear before was right until the 30th or September in will change resolution tutor to provide for that so that will happen anyway this group wouldn 't be so much wouldn 't be talking about that it will be talking about the reserve measurement plan for reads firms or what the future of reads farmers and the longer term we talked about by law or between our other physical options that we can use or other things so it 's all of all of that first establishing happens the problem is and what needs to be done about it I years so I 'm so I guess done get tied up on on that so much in i that group comes up with will come back to council so it 's not a you 've got to be on the group to be involved it will certainly comeback and yeah we could handle three this fine yeah it 's going to say in defensive counter circulars counselor billion are only but here 's a plan change with working shop with shop with man you fix it suddenly in the lake so yeah and I 'm just saying that Ridge pound farmers definitely this end of the lake but there 's a lot of other freedom camping around the lake that do affect area so a pair of Bibles différentes yeah yeah so the working pal you won 't get involved uni yes go operational issues this be closer know they 'll be done now all right so kasap zosky cancer Stewart Castle Williamson does it run heavy everything all right so saying that this number one lane otherwise it 'll be able to sit I 'd like to so you 're against three no no three so number two number two you change to authorizes officers to close for so here 's a close reads farm for campaign until the 30th or September wish you Paris can you just pose close it to comply with the present management plan is just those days because they stated in their isolated Allah see crit ya know there would be fine it 's the that campaign so we would we would put some physical or nothing in the past we 've put physical barriers in place to ensure that the camp encounter clear and then our monitoring and security companies and force that we used to do that up until the world cup so 2011 we used to do that on an annual basis okay so that 's number two number three achieve coming back to there 's no degree to investigate the potential I 'd like those words removed so actually give a direction to officers of the council to actually present us with a bylaw freedom camping Bible as other districts have done to say just investigate we can do a hell of a lot of investigating the potential for something but we don 't seem to arrive at played it before there is no we 've written there like that is from a legal compliance perspective we haven 't given you the tools at the moment through report saying here are the different options and this is why this is the favored one so if you were to tell us now to go and do a freedom camping boiler without all of those that issues assessment we believe you 'd be in breach to the local government act and doing that because you haven 't got the information in front of you hints we 're saying investigate so we can do that work and bring it back bring them to model the one potential is together potential for that was taken out that we have you but number three so come back with investigating we listen to the officers here for paralegal doesn 't see if you told me that is that they like waiting the key thing is that you will always not only predetermination better perception of predetermination that 's why the resolutions green Keithley crafted using those words if you change too much you run resolution on its face with the link that you have a predetermined position that are really thinking by rule was 45 when clearly you don 't have the evidence in front of just on their counsels happy with leaving the wedding is with us yes you know alright one two three and four could I have a move release yeah vodcast estas be singing to buy Council Williamson all those in favor please say aye next Kari just just reiterate when we do close us please would be careful we 've been one barely any potential people down the I tournaments and all that sort of thing as to how we handle them there 's any questions to the various agencies that need to be required as interviewing just paralyzed probably Pakistan Apple Inc 's in our communication organized to make sure got a plan in terms of putting face in a disc instructions from one jiri and so do be a little bit of work around those 60s and that 's involved building communicate go so you 've got to do okay please thank you jack _"

pattern it not not from Council not we don 't believe so at the stage from council so there would only call on this funding if they were successful when there are other funding application so it 's an approval one principle basically all right you worship cancer heckling we went through all that procedure about a new grants policy how does this now fit in with the see you you 'll see it 's not a grand as a nun unbudgeted expenditure Celsius it that 's been been built that is that our asset that 's been built is going to be it be a relationship when his book arrested in the council so you 're paying 15,000 towards an acid that you would then obtain so it 's not a grant we 're not giving the money is an operational money to somebody asked to go and do something not related to counsel writing the cheek so to speak once the rest of the funniest yeah I understand I 'm just just the way I read it I thought it was a grant would bite over and I do tremendous were not disputing that if if it has unbudgeted timing had have been different it would have been in your annual plan is a capital just to capitalize him yeah it 's just that timing unfortunately the annual plan had already been out and given the way that it works these days with that opportunity was missed by the time they came and he inserts in a paper here okay so two recently possible contributing towards I guess it 's 140 oh okay yeah it 'd be good deal done it all right um casal Williamson as you say through just support done with now sticking size definitely support request mr. no-brainer but um can stick risky thank you your worship just a couple of questions and I 'm assuming they are looking forward to come out of this financial year it will depend when us you write the check will depend on of which there 's a lot of is commission but they 'll still be a shortfall they have to go to other fundraisers for all themselves so we would and if you look at the resolution they 're subject to the balance beam been obtained there may be in a subsequent financial year if it is will the embed a builder into a subsequent annual plan but they need confirmation now to go into the replication the second question is just Annette be quite sure this takes the place of the proposed original overhead bridge and at what depth would what does be planted would it require resource consent thank you yes having any I assume it will we got somebody to burn I 'm aitbaar one state said will be a two-way two-way cycle traffic through the dynasty is both cyclists and pedestrians I just raised the issue we 've got no plans on this underpass I fully support what they 're attempting to do there 's one under Daugherty drive which is 2.5 white I think it is and what are we prepared to invest in something that be like for instance i would suggest it would have to be paired they 're not going even in the dark are they who contributions to the running of the pair in getting the lights in the underpass set up any lights in the clear so he says heading to that is that a keenness is only just allowing net fundraising to go through so the detailed design and construction which you would have to come back and be approved by us has the asset owner and so there 's an opportunity obviously for officers to look at at the end of week and share with the counselors at a point so we 'd be given the 15,000 subject to officers reports on design etc to each procedure what 's 15,000 subject to that other that other funding and then as we would even if they weren 't asking for money if they were going to get the money from elsewhere is the SEO donor they would need our permission to be able to to do thus the same as what you would if you open something on our road know seeking the bag counselor I think when it comes to the Williamson sorry Heather 's hand up first so the recommended resolution that we approved with the request moved by Councillor John signal by council Williamson all those in favor please say aye against Garrett I to number 9 electric vehicle charges yeah really interesting he 's got an electric car okay right questions are clear yep yep cancer strategic has a very expensive but it will change and they would become something big really usable and resilient and so I feel it from a standpoint if he would be very good thing she start looking at really going to pop them and have a going to have them my thoughts were the car park at the bathroom did not not the farmers that same clothes and stuff all over the other side of the road and they 're kind of a benefit it was one place that I thought they would be able to be not taking a step out of the central area but we 've been looking to school so people could go shopping and do and I thought that is the major highway between okay thanks me and the any room sorry i haven 't been conclusively this item and the room that they take up as a charging unit and you just drive your car in them so it takes up probably they need their reporters two parking spaces for one cat okay so two cars can get yep certainly I think as a council we need to be seen to be leaving the living rooms via castles Georgia suggestion that what we commonly tim is the McDonald 's Cap 'n between sorry it 's just what 's politically they want a joke on to a transformer do they they help to make this day is so there 's no doubt I think I met general facility i think is the movie the be speed and release miss least disruption to day-to-day activity and what do they ever counselors feel so Jonas just 30 thank you i had a couple of questions and these proposals indicate who they thought the type of person would be that would be using these charging stations are we assuming that they 're going to charge people so if they 're going to use our land here would we consider charging them rent imene yeah I mean from my perspective I think it 's really great that we 're looking exploring some of these emerging technologies but I think we need to make sure that we 're armed with all the facts because if you did a little bit of dis research when when I looked into this one and there are numerous councils around New Zealand that have got gone unto this boots and all on the basis of a clean green image and what they can do but they 've actually found they hadn 't quite got the formula right about who it is it 's using them when it 's going to be used in the right time so you can potentially end up with empty spaces or as what happened with the dunedin city council you 've got a supplier on board they invested a significant amount of time and looking at putting charging stations in and then one of the main petrol retailers came stations so from my perspective I think we should be rather saying rather than creating a policy about where we can do these things just looking at the proposals on their individual merits they know more about electric vehicles and habits and what 's happening than we do and then judge those proposals on their merits as they come in rather than run through some recommendations for policy at this stage just so we 're open for business what can we do I mean there 's lots of other really exciting opportunities coming I mean I read something about bikes that you can put on the street that people pedal to pipe our there are mobile charges and things these all sorts of things out there I don 't think we should constrain your thinking and who knows what some of the petrol retailers might have planned as well I mean maybe just put it out there that we 're keen but look at the proposals on their individual merits so that though just to clarify they 're requesting they are requesting this to happen is too funny we don we don 't read we 've got no cover proposal sitting near which were specific proposals I guess they 're both asking for different things and different locations what we as officers of try to do here as say rather than look at each of them individually which means that you get an ad hoc response we thought that it would be better for you as a council to say this is particularly in a trial situation given you are using public land for a private good this is what we would prefer to see so so the thought process was if you identify the location it might be the sharp has been talked about and then we would obviously in turn to a license to occupy with those individuals which we have they have payment and in what happens at the end of the two more if they go bust and remove all and all that sort of staff and then that would cover off the specifics if somebody else came in a third or fourth provider then we would go through that same process again cancel Williamson you irregular make sure it sorts of courses but with the help of being like for a central location that 's similar logic in terms of you know going north-south being a gateway to the north in the south and but also you know pick up the council Stewart 's point about this the rake a show i personally would sit on the CBD fringe you know with things like GPS isn 't that just finding the location it 's not the issue for people you know not foreign to the table below the tourists oh ok Oracle II and say we 've got so you mention on street cafe it 's not as in the actual that 's the sort of discussion we want from you to know what 's palatable so I think you know my sister would be inside inside the car pack but licensed occupy cut them a couple years trial and see how it goes alison has the counselors feel about that well mr. Chairman I would oppose if we 've got four resolutions before us I think I 'd agree with resolution 3 i 'm in the cvd or out of CBD eric we 've taken enough of ways of this and I think if its private enterprise they should do like all private enterprise and someone said to me the other day why hasn 't seen taking it up wasn 't mobile taking it up in other areas within the town environment you drive to a petrol station you drive to electrical petrol station sell petrol you have petrol you drive to a petrol station for petrol you 'll be driving to a place where to charge your car up they shouldn 't be in the CBD that 's for the parking I believe there should be outside outside of that CBD area so I would be opposed to any resolution that took any parking spaces up not be encouraging it because we supply twenty percent of the nation 's power the power will be coming from you our hydro station India geothermal stations it 's got to be good for business for them so you know to to to seriously to carfax to carfax and that huge Carpathia is going to make delete or ruapehu street not on street I 'm talking about internal in the cardboard so that 's all that that 's exactly what we 're asking so we want you to just tell us and happy either not happy or we are happy and we 're happy in this location so austry on on street no definitely off off street and internally and they 'll help out and make about them gps is council william said gps they 'll soon find it into spaces they want to have two charging stations ok perhaps do how many companies are gonna come on a project is this these two and we 've had discussions with another business in town who 's a retailer as well as a generator I mean they want to put it outside their office as well so but they haven 't transferred to the next stage it but we 've got two in front of us if you were to approves us who knows how many others are out there you 've got for petrol station companies at the moment seed I understand is actively promoting you are which is the very reason that this is in front of you in this form so that you can have these discussions ok thanks very much just to fear this event what I 'm hearing is I think we need some more information I think we all agree in principle that we support it but I 'm wondering if we should find a different way to shake that leaves out and work out who 's out there and what the locations are I don 't feel as we got an episode you want experiences of interest rates of interest maybe we can do that all rolling so the other two we are to maximum effect isn 't it really love this supply is going to be okay but if you 're going out to expression of insurance we need to say the location that 's right which is the car park not Street pulse a car park n number of spaces that we 're talking to and total you end a net McDonald 's car park but down by Briscoe 's that 's what I 'm here yeah somewhere the proposals back to you and you can pick between any of those then if they 've got to do some investigations on getting power to side and all that they can they can do their calculations or they 've got their rent or expectation always tough yeah could I suggest potentially that maybe story place or somewhere down near our Library and Information Center might be potential site those park is really tight you 're sitting there in fact because it 's not fully utilized all you know all the time the two least used car parts off street copaxone terms that one and the one behind ebbets ripple sports those are the tube under usual I Scabbers clean they 've clarification if you going out for expressions of interest is that to the four or five big energy companies as well but we 're just going to Joe Bloggs that just put the system you 're just go public you 're not going to specifically right to those companies to see where they are but just heard mention of Z so we 're going to go down that route well why would we want to if they going to do it that 's the point I 'm making just a clarification on that it would be a license to have occupied wouldn 't be freed as such they would be up to you so they a New York series of interest that put forward what they want and it would be whether or not they 'd and turned on paying a license fee or not enough so how much that was just to clarify again this dead when we talk about two it 's two lots which equals full car tax that 's over to you to decide we did that now so that we can put that on the expression of interest document aliens no clarification so then effectively today we 've decided to do a wave if we continue again the strip with five car packs one this morning what 's happening my point exactly right okay so to two or four so I 'm suggesting to to see when they added bomb dumpy expenses of interest clear and the paper map no big fancy expressions of for a two-year two more three-year term trial whatever a good local newspaper will do a good story on for us yes motorist okay so resolution to that effect they have a mover please also resolved by what 's awaiting on their resolution place for expressions of interest for two of two Kovacs add likely total and it 's like all of call for expressions of interest to provide or to allow to up to a maximum of two car parks well then with a Power Packs called the 248 our street Robert streetcar part and for the use of electric vehicle charging station to station which is to get our parts total yeah so you might get depend on what you hear them you might get two companies that you have two separate companies you might get one company that has two and you 'll get a pick out of whatever that looks like and this term for further clarification specific area is within the CBD area victory for the net car park bet down that whatever school wasn 't the mcdonalds my college who feels like a king us going to go sorry only they 're almost up Leah electric lances alright any can I have a move please he can sister thinking about Kasich 's husky all those in favor say aye as against I could have my vote recorded please no against the power yep okay thank you very much _"

Richard Hoadley for this sculpture and to be located in seeking pot mr. Holley offers his apologies is in Australia my understanding he was going to present this item so i 'll try my best with any questions you 've got okay all right is it the Petrova doesn 't my question mr ridd and obviously we have a sculpture trust and 10 is this been done pastors contrast or as well as about any approval from me more no it 's not no it 's not HUD approval from two separate application application yep the other one consulted me um your worship I see the term if we do approve it it 's got to come out of the 16 17 financial year cuz I just asked the question on that 16 kind of somebody coming year it just make me the way I 'm reading it approves fifty percent of funding to a maximum of two thousand so the total scope is going to be four thousand dollars by mr. Hoadley you think that 's highlights in the financial session council 's every inquiries Casa Cristo Steven thank you very much I 'm just a couple of questions number one is that presumably debt would be dead at the two thousand dollars that he 's seeking would then come tab of this sculpture fund of 25,000 was correct and secondly did he provide a rationale as to the location of them way he 's proposing decided it was no there 's no rationale there was the question was asked could it be located in cecum park and I suggested that location because it 's used have a tree in there so it sort of fits the sculpture quite nicely let 's yeah there was no rationale behind the location that I that I could understand what a benefit of the community most of the community would be using the walkway the Lions walk of your life as to the cyclist worse at a better occasion dear you certainly it 's only that the cars that go down there that what 's in can you have a questions or full bar too we 've established that the total cost is 180 and it states the council funding would be a thousand dollars but we 've been asked for two thousand am I reading this wrong you ridden it real reading the wrong and so John clarity or so a thousand dollars came from there 's a thousand dollars i think from creative numerator newseum so that was an approved but who 's based on council providing some funding and the funding being requested there is is fifty percent of the costs which is 2090 and the shortfall will be funded by the applicants so my math is terrible what I imagine is about a thousand dollars would be covered by the applicant okay so 52,000 about council panel that 's creative Museum all right a great chemistry no two thousand dollars from next year 's public art budget a thousand dollars has come from external funding leaving a shortfall which will be covered by that we can thank e3 wizard Council willemsen under the risk it mentions that signage will indicate the old is a sculpture and not play the rope potentially what to plug the big boy for example this is always a risk there with with sculpture so the sign is obviously is we 're going to get in your screen door for something health or safety will see with fros district councils concerned that 's intent you Thank You mr. hood and we Heather sculpture trust in town would it not be prudent to who specialize in these sorts of things would it not be protein problem to run this particular application passing to see their support or is it I think it is always prudent but that 's your call the guesses yeah ok now the counselors I 'm just a little bit over the diagram and I 'm to earth through the chair i think i was arranged i would agree with the mirror on this one I think if we could maybe approve it and principal subject to the sculptor chest because if we do gives us money then that 's less money that they 've got for the next financial year so would that sit comfortably with everyone how does he have or the sculpture or the retina process not to trust so that says what I 'm suggesting here is to give it to the sculpture trust obviously you 'll never get agreeance on what it looks like and how beautiful is going to be but they the ones that specialize they have a makeup of various people on the trust they they specialize in these sorts of things and I would suggest that we run a fast in your approval then bring back to the council Chancellor heckling here oh I think I 'm a little bit by councillor Harvey I see the essence of of this sculpture depicting the geothermal tired concept and seeking focus is sort of no cheer for more in that area and I would have thought it would have been better where the geothermal is it you know I just have some difficulty just assess in this particular piece of sculpture in that position that 's just how I feel you know just want to raise the question in regards of the sculptural trusts and sculptures generally in the district is the scope to trust regards a sculptor score for Joe Bob public mr. only has come to us do we have to refer to the scope to across we either so we don 't want it or we do dependent trust they have been appointed on there because of their skills will they appoint themselves because of their skills they haven 't got an exclusive right to the council money so anybody can apply for that what uses council traditionally have said though is that you 're not in the business of approving what 's good or bad art because that 's beauty of the new either beholder so i guess the suggestion here from the mirrors that if we go back to the sculpture trust who are the recognized group of what 's good on what spared at least there would be advising you if it is the right thing on the right location and the alternative is that you you decline it today or you approve it today so they bit sort of the three the three options it would be the one I 'd like to go with which is which subject to my suggestions a hold of subject to console consultation this come to trust they can still say yay or nay and we still come back with still comes we 're still coming back to you so you still have the final decision even if they say no you still hold that decision but you at least they know what they think when you 're making that decision okay so we 'll just hold it that at the moment _"

    "text": "moving on the prior nickel is 94 people page number 67 just check out the area so see how are we going hey are you okay you know five okay so and carry on with the TIG if you like mr. load broken Tony let Brooke and Paige 24 javis and Panasonic firstly a nice to have seen seen that we look as though we have a uniform Gemini without colored jerseys ok that 's just purely fortuitous and is this working yes yep um I would just like to start by saying that the work that council has done has certainly been very appreciated and and I think in particular with regard to the keeping a cap on the rates increase and the increased reduction and it and can keep up the good work please that were very much appreciated by the rate pairs um my you have my submission in front of you but I i want to just raise concerns that I have about the the consultation process for the white Avenue water scheme which is what I 'm getting to discuss the the thing that comes twofold one is submission on the availability charge and the other is rates and charges and the most important part of what 's going on with the white a new water scheme is in fact the related to the capital contribution and that that has been set at I think 2454 every household that 's going to join up with the scheme down there and if all members of that community join up with it then we 're looking at over just over five hundred thousand dollars and what council hair heaven place is that they want to shift the onus of the payment by Waitaha nui onto the shoulders of the ratepayers see the ratepayers tied up with the Talpiot water scheme and this some this i think has it came up in your consultation glossy flyer which went out and and it has put down what you 're expecting to take players usually in some little balloon so there are a whole lot of balloons there and and here we are something so important that it hasn 't actually been put up for submission and I I don we are dealing with five hundred thousand-plus that you 're wanting to put on to the ratepayers the non-white Avenue ratepayers and it has not been put up for submission if I could just read a document to you to refresh your memory here and this document slope of the wet our water supply attachment B and the summary of this state 's an alternative proposal is to connect Waitaha nui to the taupo water scheme with the cost for this project to be distributed across the top a scheme this proposal would mean consultation is required across the top a scheme catchment and there would be no capital cost to the waiter who knew community for connection this ensures that the proposal becomes as a portable as can be possible and I I draw your attention to the proposal there there 's also at the one of the council meetings there is another document there which specifies prepare them consultation on that as well as consultation on the availability church so I I think at this point of time it seems some inappropriate to be trying to make any decide to be informed properly and to decide whether they feel happy with the 500,000 that they gained a shoulder for what are doing now if I can there that 's I 'd like to go now to my submission which is before you and you have read that no down so i will just go through some of these points firstly the the majority of ratatouille residents not in favor of joining the scheme and they have been repeated meetings and they 're not going to shift very readily one of the reasons that is given is the reluctance of the the householders because of the requirement to pay for the service these payments are firstly the connection or for the connection of the capital contribution that I mentioned two thousand four hundred and fifty plus C annual water rates we haven 't in that document taken into account anything such as the cost to those people of personally having to connect up to the tabi and run it into the house and that 's an additional cost now I 'm led to believe that many of the residents not the belief that the firm belief that the water was there right and they were not going to pay for it and so this obviously has been the reason why council has turned around and looked at other measures now the first of those was clearly to approach the funding authorities down on willington looking for another five hundred thousand now that that sort of looks as a debt was the money that council were looking for to cover and subsidize the setup fees that the will set up charges that the householders again to incur I think that you know what does council plan to do here they we have before us the amendment regarding the availability charge which we don 't support the TRG that they 're looking to counselor looking to have us as rate pairs and Talpiot pay for the the capital contribution and then on top of that there is the thing at the annual water charge of four hundred and seventy dollars now when you have a community that is firmly against paying anything for their water you can be quite certain that those who join up so this council planning again to have another put out another submission for revision of those rates another point I 'd makers at council cannot impose a water scheme on the waiter and a weight on you a community community when they have expressed reluctance to join I i believe it is irresponsible use of ratepayers and taxpayers money to put in a pipeline knowing that the take-up rate of this will be very limited now the other water here is throughout the Talpiot district have been user pays and to set up water skiing for weiterhin areas and non user pays I believe sits a very dangerous precedent first off the block will be five mile Bay there have been two going to be supplied on the same line and council we have to be very aware of the problems here if you 're going to deliver water to weiterhin ooh gratis and then you 're going to expect five mile Bay to pay all the setup fees or set up charges council who obviously has taken a lot of note of the classification of council considers and i would say i think we probably need to have more consultation on this but if they consider that because of the social deprivation in that area water should be supplied gratis to the householders then I would argue very strongly that it is not the responsibility of the ratepayers to fend areas of social deprivation council needs to have a look or look for additional funding for the capital contribution be it looking centrally or looking locally but definitely not the ratepayers if councillors able to obtain funding it will need to pursue the other state at alternative which is to upgrade the water purification of the 37 Waitaha new properties that are currently connected to the council 's existing water supply and I know that this is considered a costly exercise but I don 't believe you can put a costly line into white out who knew with the current situation knowing full well that the take-up rate is going to be very poor if there 's any sense of money having to be paid for it as I said I believe that irresponsible and asked for submission I 'm not submitting on the the charger fees and charges but the original intent here and I put it in my submission was to submit on the rates remission for the proposed to me or for the amendment sorry for the general availability charge now finally TRG would recommend that any water reservoir if water was going to be supplied to weiterhin II should be on council land and I would we would fully support the argument that you give about the uncertainties that would lie ahead if it was on any other the other alternative so that 's really all I have to say thank you for your time I 'll open to questions let blood work nice to have you here this morning and your submission do we have any questions of dr. loaded Castle Park and thank you Tony where 's a pleated here for me just so IM ter geez opinion it basically it 's a three-million-dollar sort of project do you think it it 's a responsible if we do it do you think it 's also a responsible of us 're being influenced too much by this money and you 're making a rather unwise decisions just to grab their money and I I think you know cancel them again to regret this because people in this area and not willing to help this disparity between who gets free water and who doesn 't and and certainly not to prop up the free water so in the big picture of things I haven 't decided how I feel about Beth them still open minded about it but I just so in the big picture I mean this a three million dollar project will cost the district 1 million in round numbers and you think we should just let that go for the sake of a lady some unpaid rates yes a I know exactly what you 're saying and I thought about this at length because I knew was going to be one of the first questions it 's a I I really believe you need to consult with the community a bit more those who are going to be expected to pay and call for submissions and then I be done with discussing with the residents of wet oh Henry who is so opposed to this and very firmly opposed that also you should be looking at our option of whether local funding could be of any benefit to that community and I I think that is an option that should be seriously pursued just a hobby it is an interesting one and like counts of a park I mean we 're also aware and I don 't know whether you are that there are some areas down there that don 't have suitable drinking water at all so we do have a responsibility of some sort to supply that so there is that catch-22 situation mmm yes and we have consulted several times with people down there with the same result may say absolutely mmm however like anything people sell and move on so what happens to the new people that are coming to the district all the time and they may want the new water and and for those who as I said have no suitable alternative what what are we supposed to do with them well of thinking you obtain the funding to subsidize the free water to any area of deprivation and if it 's not government who 's going to do that then and they 've knocked you back already but and it 's interesting that they have but there is other sort of there are other sources of funding and there is a yes I know but there is a very strong move for the manner oty and you know this should be looked at more seriously that would overcome the problem because if those residents were then able to be subsidized and they it 's justified to try and help them I 'm not saying we we don 't want to see that but then you have every a clear conscience to set up an a-line down there and then of course that can be built on 45 mile Bay without the hassle of having to battle with pave mel bay I mean there is always all sorts of change has some sort of battle doesn 't yeah so that 's what we have to deal with hmm Wayne up the pros because we 've obviously looked at this in depth do you bet all those who are against it or do you try and weigh up the benefits for those who are coming going to come to the area in the future that 's what we have to wear and then I would go back to looking for additional funding wouldn 't I and then that would so so councils problem just come back to the submission documented it the consult on did you say that 's not enough yeah I I think an important issue like this where 500,000 is you know going to be taken out of general rates or rates for people who are on the top o water I think that this needs to be well advertised and submissions come in for that and I don 't believe that as anything more than just a glossy fly over that then says we 'd like to hear from you yet you then look a little bit further down on your website these are the submissions and they being you know as I said the availability charge and peas it actually doesn 't take too much to rather feel that that was could have been put in as a little bit of a smokescreen to you know because if everyone would just did it could weld think that this whole thing was going through was illegal but thank you for your submission I was just wondering and when you were you 've written it here you can also considered the firefighting a teacher they 're putting this sorry I hearings not a good sign I 'll repeat there I 'm considering that your submission did you also consider the the fire fighting capacity they 're putting the lineup they would provide for all those houses what package wasn 't fire fighting capacity oh yes I 'm aware of that but the firefighting is of course already serviced this line would provide that service out there before yes but it you 're the firefighting is also from the current supply no that 's very I think yes yes really think style isn 't you want us to do voice of reason is that yeah so I was doing since your your reasoning is it and what 's new commute a totally opposed it I 've had to pay well if I had to pay to join the to join the scheme because i was i 'm a lady i mean my recipe of rest and information work up here is it eighty-four percent respondents actually really connect or they agree with the actual project going ahead which equates to the stage twenty eight percent of people actually join you up to the scheme there 's about five dollars per ratepayer through the scheme if the 69 seen I think if they up take the big would cut me no cost to the great payable through the community will hit hell you feel about that that was a she what I have enjoyed it in sorry I know ya know this one I i think that the principle of what you 're trying to do by use rate payers money to subsidize that service is wrong and if if council feels that they determined that it is right to do that then I think I would be very keen to argue to cancel that if you believe you were going to proceed on with this I think we should fund that from the council thumbs rather than taking it out ratepayers out of the general rate so here in the books clearly documented 500 plus thousand that has gone to weiterhin ooh-eee where you take it from the rates it gets lost in the whole system so if that was going to happen I think I would be pretty keen to convince our members that the right approach was to have this documented as a an additional cost in your finance document I 'm just and yes it 's true somebody can have a consumer you saying that it 's free lucia for weiterhin OE the connections are going to be there but if someone connects to that water they will be paying so um I see it but one way of I 'm looking at it is because I haven 't sort of it 's got to be looked at in all ways is that it 's free future-proofing weiterhin away for for growth and expansion and we were in that so I thats that 's one of the ways that I 'm looking at it how I 'm going to make my decision about this is that it is future proof for your future proofing there an area of our district that his potential and I see that that is a positive person no I could ask you how you would fear the develop whiter nuit it 's very restricted now is going to be it would be very difficult to extend a line over the hill to how to pee and further down and I am done and there 's not much scope to develop her white oh honey but I agree with what you 're all saying you know it 's good to take up the the funding and that the government have allocated and to sit the pipeline up but what I 'm saying is to do that you need to pursue the you 're going to have to fund the you know that contribution the capital contribution and I am also saying you 've probably gained have to fund a high percentage of the water to me if you can find the appropriate funding then it 's it 's a go ahead cancer dollars so to clarify Tony what you 'd be saying is TRG would be in support if we could find it different funding mechanism within our current arsenal other than targeting the rates of the water scheme that are at the moment yes yes okay so it none of us feel that you know that it clearly is an area of deprivation and you know we do need to have support for that area but it 's not our responsibility to do their SS top o ratepayers it 's a willemsen yes you know thinks yeah through that you think 's in with you I this question be more directed to Venus for example them if this project didn 't scheme didn 't go ahead for example you know and the event of my going here and we will record to upgrade 37 water user down the end of the current district council scheme what would it cost and who would it cost who will be paying roughly you got the audience top of my head but it would be the cusp of all those three saving that I currently connected to the scheme okay and I just break in there there would be a cross developing the just creepy part of the upgrade you 've been influenced by there in your decision origins because you considerably too costly it 's somewhere easy to to not explore that quite as well as you may think you 've got a round of whatever 1.9 million council body history just give me time to thank you for you your comments in submission councillor park used the word district funding it 's my understanding office of the cancer will help that it will be an impasse on the tap o water scheme I mean is 19 around that the district so it 's not been passed on them the scenario has been put to me I live in an area there 's a lot of development going on at the moment and the Christian raised is if we subsidize the scheme and say to the people it 's going past to gate but you don new house owner to cut the cost to put a water tank and use their own water and not connect on the basis they didn 't have to why should I so I know when I lived in bonshaw park we look to joining up three thousand dollars on average to join in about three thousand it was great so the real question is and I understand people saying if someone buys in the future but if you buy something in the future you look at what 's there and then you make a judgment on that so does TRG feel that it may set a peach make for other areas to demand the same and have it funded by others Oh without that I think this is what I said setting a precedent and first off the books will be firepower bay because they they 're going to be the first to to be connected yes I just threw the chair when I seek district I was just talking about the big picture of things rather then I know that it is just total water scheme okay thank you 're okay with the scheme as long as the money was found elsewhere yeah I 'm just thinking that as an example from the investment fund or we 're council money or i am from central further first of all you should look for external funding and 1.9 and and there are as I said two possible sources it could be local it could be go back to government that if you were as council were determined that this was to go through and I would like to say there that would be good to consult on that and just get the feeling because there may be other ideas had come out of the community who really am very aware of this but um the the funding if it was going to come from Council funds should be allocated and clearly allocated to their prom and paid for by those that receive the benefit or the whole community well you going to get it paid for well good question that 's what an issues that we face when you know the town mode scheme has 470 I think next year scheme is different and they will want to carry on every other water thing will come back to you and want to do the same thing about a council fans so it 's the precedent that you 're sitting that you have to take note of it 's very dangerous precedent acting maybe it won 't involve all of you but it will catch up it just just another with your other hat on as a retired GP do you think a retired physician please decisions I would the health benefits of the good quality water do you see that is a acosta let ya don 't don 't think anyone could argue on the you noticed important none of us would argue against that but it 's just how you get that established thanks very much like a good to see all right how are we going he real sorry okay all right back to item number one is a suggested resolution their recommended resolution there 's submissions on the consultation document in your vein you received move by glyn Scott Williamson LC can sing too by constant zosky well so the meeting will be tuned until what they seem for june for deliberations seen the clock on the 715 deliberations cancer dreamin would you Matt be able to give a see listen before we go in this is for the week ahead thank you yeah Toki at Attica to tea at photo Tata araki me te arawa audio to MIDI finger tight Anna it all to attain what Anthony

    "text": "okay you have a gap of time good ok next one page number 25 total residents group and the fee plumber mission number 16 good morning mr. Plummer mm-hmm mayor counselors thank you I thought I was the opportunity of not having to hear for me once again in submissions I seem to be sitting here on a Philly annual base but Richard Hoagland this today but he got called away for family matters last night so unfortunately otherwise you 've got me I just wish to start by saying that we appreciate the dialogue that TIG has with counsel and indeed with management and the manner in which staff they are continually hassled by by us but on most occasions kindly answer and provide the information that that we we often ask for also just was to make the point that TRG is very much alive tableau residence group and active our committee is meeting on a regular basis we have members or as you know where laundry organization but we continue to have people who contact us where we 're not out counting for members they 're such database so they keep boom distorts happening and we are in getting more and more requests from both members and other people around the community on issues that they see are relevant and would like bought two certainly research slightly and what perhaps to the attention of council so I guess that under our mission statement is very much the role that we continue to play in which had your Richard submission was discussed and approved by our committee before he submitted it to you and just briefly going through it he will acknowledge very much appreciate that council have been able to look towards a decrease in the increase in the annual rate and we are grateful of the work done by council that to achieve this likewise the importance of reviewing the fees and we suggest that should be done I know it 's not easy within the 10-year plan parameters but to review the fees and adjust them according to you user pay principles and we very much appreciate that we have brought to your attention the treatment treasury I 'm sorry management policy and in looking for an annual review of that policy and we just like to make the point this 250 where are you at on reviewing that policy in terms of this coming financial year I 'm and what is it to be done and what degree of consulting and transparency in review of their policy one of the initiatives that TIG have taken as if we have no activated a what we call a finance subcommittee where we have asked for and been given some of your Treasury documents and finances so as we were able to look at that is simply in primary on a complementary base to ensure that the community I guess on album that we are looking after aware of the council are keeping within the proposed 10-year plan parameters in terms of their finances and that the requirements within the treasury management policy I 'd being adhered to on the way through on your annual basis and I guess what we are simply saying in the submission is that we appreciate the dialogue that we have already received from the financial Treasury Department of council and that not necessarily with pins to stick into you but but rather to discuss on whys and wherefores and the reasons and never to get even greater transparency in that area we raised in the submission the issue of the scope and it 's obviously relevant in light of the resignation of the currency so the CEO was the scope of the employment art needs of a CEO and the important aspect as we see as the relationship between the governance team and the management team and we 're responsibilities lie and that those definitions are clearly defined and again I keep using this word transparent as seen and acknowledged and openly understood we have been brought to our attention out of left field interestingly on a couple of occasions issues word has been thought the decisions have been made even by management or indeed by the governance team that that haven 't been adequately discussed consultant and I 'm not quite sure what were we should be playing in this but then I say it 's coming across our table and I 'm simply asking a question back of view are clearly and and clarified between what is the roles of each of the end each of the responsibilities just while I 'm on the issue of CEO Rob Williams has left you it was publicly announced that he was leaving but it would appear that he was left a little more hastily that certainly me probably being ignorant of Linda birth and I acknowledge I haven 't been in town with each of the media 's but from what I understand and I simply ask again is there some rhyme or reason and is there been any one off for the agreement reached to facilitate his leaving in such a manner and as I understand the start of the new job was about to start a new job today finally in Richard submission and we just cover the issue of the water management and I guess this is all ahead of us in terms of the changes to the Resource Management Act and the responsibilities that that is going to put on when we requirements implied to councils and district councils and I guess we 're signaling that once you but once it 's on your table mr. mayor that there is adequate consultation that the relationship between the various parties and the rights to sit on I mean committees or indeed on for councils are fully canvas and roams and reasons fully discussed it does a contentious issue and I guess tigr just signaling that it 's ahead of us and we 'll said he would like to be involved but I think it 's most important the wider community is involved in before decisions are made hastily currently it 's an issue in the media we see what happened in New Plymouth and it 's interestingly that masterton District Council 's made decisions in the last week or so in terms of representation and by chance I happen to be very friendly with one of their counselors who was absolutely irate that he himself a counselor was not informed of those decisions so I 'm just giving a little message here but thank you I present that submission and call for questions and andrew Lee more than questions ask that you take note of them may be raised in that submission great thank you very much totally good to see you again any questions mr. Plummer counselor kruszewski thank you thank you for that Timothy just to help me fully understand at the point that you 're trying to make on on your first page under the CEO scope of employment needs to be carefully reviewed and to ensure there 's adequate authority by the mayor and councillors exactly what do you mean by that adequate authority I i I 'd hoped I 'd explained that that there is a clear differentiation between what is responsibility of governments and what is responsibility of CEO but in the government 's giving direction to management that must clearly be be known and be adequately publicized too bad word but but so the community understands clearly which we 're the demarcation lines are and what decisions are made of what levels right down the chain I mean I for example a request came in recent days about some trees somewhere and I haven 't got my mind around it at all that but where was the responsibility of of those had someone approached a counselor and the resulting of whatever might happen so you 're referring to delegated authority and responsible i 'm talking to the chair clarification clarity the word clarity of delegation i guess thank you somebody Thank You Timothy have you seen the what we as accounts or require or for what do you call it for the new CEO that we advertise if we need to see any advertisement I haven 't seen the word not terms of reference but well they don 't I understand you have advertised for new CEO I assume that that 's in the hands of an independent party that has been employed to the first instance seek people for for the job and they 'll shortlist and counsel then get involved I assume that 's the role that you you would normally fight it made not in terms of the detail now I have not seen what the specs are is that it 's public knowledge is having on the website so to do a moment of CEOs is with reading cancer Williamson thanks to Billy thinks run to a 're concerned about the clarity budgets and the financial statements being poor motor work not well understood by councillors and why do you say that I mean obviously are you say that cuz you think the slope is a poor or the cloud at budgets is not good because we not that 's not articulated to us properly through the staff or the thought maybe sir all of the answers to communicate with the council stick negotiators came out with a staff regarding if there 's any queries or no questions asked in the train policy is there 's only healthy yes that 's why we 're here of course don 't understand that so I I guess a little needle in this one what what we have complimented you and final sign-off on the 10-year plan and clearly the submissions that we gave at that time were not recognized too much certainly around the issue of Treasury we have continuing concerns that there is areas of responsibility that you have signed on yours council have signed off giving to Treasury in terms of equity investment and they are aside has to be questionable as to whether a sprint or not for a local council to be doing so I guess what we 're saying in that statement really is the the need to ensure the counselors are kept abreast with what is happening fully briefed and able to and confident to reassure the ratepayers that it 's in their best interest doing to allow Treasury to continue to do and i use the the equity business is just one example he thinks it 's one other point disregarding water management so acidic support the submission area reviews on everybody else equal rights irrespective of separately we participate agreement some other the currently the counselors about seven arranged with e we your range from the goat forms to agreements to legislation and obviously there to TDC submission to the report for the earth consumed how that fitted in with the car garage is filling with the baseeri participation it 's certainly acknowledge my dog lab where does have a was leading I guess in some ways but it has I already has special arrangements in relationship to the lake of but certainly the importance of upholding the rights of equal voices and democracy in the community we as a group says is important and the voice of all the community should be heard but where the privileges should be given and what to extend privileges should be given I guess is what the debates going to be all about thank you is it as well mr. Ward 's here what percentage are their portfolio or investment portfolios and equities at the moment just to clarify that further mr. Ward the investment and the share market is from the tour fund and there 's an allocation is at fifteen percent of that fund is a range allocation that 's available in from group delegated for Council of which about 12 seem to the city queens of the tour fund or the total funds all of the tour phone when the scent of the telephone sport is council make restored okay thank you very much as plumber appreciate your time today and good to see you again alright dude _"

    "text": "page number 42 submission number 27 federated Farmers newzealand Neil heather honey Neil good morning floor as yours Neil okay thank you very much neon deal here there are numb on the Federated rotary chapter federated Farmers I came through from Rotorua today resent less I 've been to quite a few of these over the years I 'm the last few years I haven 't done the presentation but what I have noticed is that you know the council seems to take out when we support right the capital rating system and the transition which we accepted a couple of years ago and you very rigidly supported that but the council doesn 't seem to take into consideration any of our other concerns about how much the rural ratepayers especially farmers end up having to foot for this council and if you 're talking about 2% waitrose if you 're talking about a two percent rate rise on 20,000 or fifteen thousand dollars it 's a lot more than a two person rate rose on two and a half thousand so we have we do have concerns about not pages but a day it does not include rates for example properties which we we would prefer to see in me so that the rule especially the rural ratepayers would see what difference that would make to the rates are not our 2015 16 the general rate for rule which is with the differential of one was 00 37 6 18 and the dollar of capital value in 2016-17 eNOS was increased 200 228 195 which is an increase of about two percent rule ratepayers will experience a two percent increase in the single rating mechanisms this information should be included in consultation documents along with the changes to other rating mechanisms regardless of where these increases were signaled in the long-term plan transition is over in 2012 telp a transition from using land value as a base for the general rate to capital value federated farmers supported this change because capital value better reflects demand and is more equitable demand on the council services team tends to be generated by more intensively developed properties rather than b li and the capital rep rating value system is also better way and identifies the real growth of the community and reckon not and it is recognized on the council books however we have concerns about the transitional period result in the reduction of the UAG see which was intended to reduce price shops on residential properties now the capital value has been used the uniform n you 'd charge being used should be used at its fullest thirty percent extent will actually reduce reliance on a genuine rate so we strongly encourage a council to return to hire a GC level now that the transition period is complete it is more preferable to ratepayers to pay a couple of hundred dollars towards the uniform annual charge and it is to pay thousands of dollars towards the general rate and in 2012 a single general rate was applied across a district with the idea that over time it generate is then allocated on the basis of the benefits that different groups receive now that the true transition period is over and rule differentials can be lowered to 0.8 because rule properties are currently paying disproportionate amount towards the general rate compete the concluded by reducing the rule differential 2 point 0 0 point 8 and increase in the uniform annual charge close to thirty percent of total rate take the uniform image charge remains the same as last year two hundred and fifty dollars the rating property federated farmers strongly supports the use of the uniform annual charge and targeted rates and encourages councils to wear appropriate at increasing those charges to the maximum of thirty percent under local government legislation for years ago federated farmers accepted a reduction of a uniform annual charge as a means to smooth impact on residential properties and the shift from land-based rating to capital base rating this transition period was noted has been completed in the 2015 2025 long-term plan the uniform annual charge four years ago was nineteen percent at four hundred and sixty dollars per property and forty 1415 two hundred and fifty dollars per property charge equates to fifteen percent this would be this work would have decreased further seen as their other rating mechanisms have increased yet the uniform any charge remains the same this is far short of a maximum charge remains at 250 over the life of a long-term plan the percentage of the uniform annual charge 24 25 year will have fallen to a woeful y 11.7 percent better a farmer strongly encourages the council to make four years of this market mechanism the uniform any charge is a fair way for councils to rate for services that provide an equal amount of benefit across ratepayers groups so we recommend the council increases a uniform annual chart annual general cards per property up to the maximum thirty percent with them all to em of this long-term plan to provide a more equitable funding stream for ratepayers and also that the council council better match the use or benefit of services with the charging mechanism used an ear for the amount paid by households this includes the economic development community facilities and storm water rates fit in fact by the farmer supports the use of differentials and considers that they provide a necessary recognition of a lower demand of sewer services by rural ratepayers we submit that the Talpiot District Council uses differentials to the full advantage play having the property examples in the funding them take statements show that a median value farm will pay twelve thousand six hundred and fifty dollars towards a general rate alone this is a colossal amount of money to have available to give to the council and would not be expected of a residential property even though they receive the same use of service from activities listed above this would be among the top operating expenses of a farm over and above many other business costs we catch which I take it you will have the most recent NP I model farm for a central North Island Hill Country shooting beef shot I am showing that the rates are a considerable expense compared to other farm operation operation costs compared the general rate that this farm pays with the high value tempo residential property at 745,000 CV which will pay only 2308 towards the general rate the farm will pay four hundred and forty-eight percent more than the residential property towards he exact same council services at 2.29 five million CV commercial property will only pay 11,000 659 the woods are generating differential is desperately needed so we recommend the council maintain a differential system for the general rate and that the rear differential on a district-wide generate we set at a lower Oh point eight of the urban differential we are pleased that the rule dog category remains at twenty-five percent now I take it I 'm not reading in the one they wear the main points we are concerned about I take it everyone 's really our submissions so I think you probably get the point submission um cancer pack yeah I 'm thinking oh nice to see you back here again add just one question with federated Farmers what is your definition of role if it was to be a different differential I mean you have a lot of lifestyle blocks and etc so what would your definition of rural be well I had the feeling sure we will be the big working farms because that 's who we represent so you 're probably looking at a different Council seated at different rates but probably bits hundred hippies and over you any of it sir chris dusky thank you 'd like us to implement can you please list at the top three and now our priority dad would be useful to you at the top for you okay well of course the differential would be the main one the UAG see and I can leave you to pick the third one because that they 're the ones that would have a stays two other ones that would have the biggest impact on the real rates thank you okay any other questions are you know cancer buddy the link to the presentation examine there 's an X 480 far as I presume the work that you people do for the rural area at the last submissions which your counterpart presented I 'll set off again have you had any dialogue with the Gisborne District Council that have the uniform annual rate up to the maximum i personally I haven 't_''_622.22 I was called him at the last minute to come and present this so I didn 't do that with but I know we run from Rotorua the council is the uniform and chives are significantly higher it isn 't them if we counseled to move up to the mix thank you we have a difficulty in the council here we just had a presentation this morning in regards of additional additional accommodation or whatever at a particular property those people obtain a WAG at the moment so if we increase that to your thirty percent there 'll be big impact on them last submission I said to the person that we 're here at the moment for all files is funded from the general rate are you happy with that the rule for are you talking about yeah I see that is changing over the rules are for our service is going to be merging and it 's going to be one identity somewhere I understanding is that the council 's won 't be footing any booze when that is done for the rule for service mr. chairman asked on page one bar 48 or 48 47 you ready out in regards of comparing residential properties the rural I noted that you quoted a commercial property at 2.29 five million pain eleven thousand six hundred and fifty-nine you realize differential of one would be paying 647 a considerable say me I haven 't got those like I said I was called in at last minute to presume less so the point I was making that farming is a commercial venture our commercial rate payers pay differential 1.8 rules it kept the one uh yeah you 've got to understand they actually I don 't believe that Beth their usefulness commercial venture it is out away from the town I don 't believe they have a huge demand on the council services um compared to and cam and we have the same problem later as far as you know that we are expected to promote tourism we expected to pick up all the pegs of things that actually we don 't totally benefit from and I 'm here to see a counselor and this one would be no different that would actually promote farming within the area but you expect us to promote tourism and let 's it 's a separate business as well thank you okay thanks Neil okay thank you thank you very much time today didn 't appreciate your way _"

    "text": "alright ah okay have we got next 25 here we go put i 'm nikki smith look like Nicki okay she tied to a team that 's just a synchronicity here sorry here I 'm Katie Johnston age 28 my age far away okay Kathy good morning good morning here this morning floor is yours thank you um well as you know i 'm representing the taphouse scope to trust i 've been a trustee on the trust for as long as the trust has actually existed so as one of the inaugural members of it and obviously my patient is still still lies within the trust um I 'm really now having to follow on from what nikki has said so I 'm just going to hit the read I 'm afraid because I hadn 't really become that haven 't come net prepared and tourism was pushing forward as a key player an economic growth and taco and with business prospering due to an increase in spending in a decrease in online shopping people are wanting to enjoy a feel-good shopping experience in our town top o District visitors as evident with the widening of the footpaths on lake terrace and the roundabout beautification around town over the last 12 months we believe our growing public art collection also enlivens item and creates experiences that increase our attractiveness as a place to live and work and enhances our reputation is a fresh destination public art contributes to visitor experiences that are distinct and memorable the type of district council has displayed the value you place on what we are doing we were delighted when the photo of siren was on the cover of your 2014 in your plan and recently we received a request for more of our scope to walk brochures to go and mail out two new ratepayers we 're very proud of the seven permanent sculptures at me heaven taupo but have decided as time to lift our game will need to ensure that our collection of sculptors continues to grow as a trust it 's our intention to seek fewer works but raise our standard and level of the loan and permanent works from new zealand 's leading sculptors this will indeed take more in the community and growing support we believe now is the time to do so important sculptors of any scale will cost more than a hundred thousand dollars and with the current public art funding at 25,000 that makes it extremely difficult for us to contemplate acquiring a major piece would you please support us by returning the public art but i 'd take to a hundred k as it was in 2009 thank you really clear request there and concise ok any questions of caffee and the counselors just the related thank you answer buddy thank you for that presentation you 've mentioned you wanting it to go back for 25,000 to the hundred thousand now successful are you in getting public donations now the reason I raised that I was in Tehran and recently and when you had to look at their hearing McCleary which had 800,000 of public contribution last week as a new plymouth are mentally that lean Lyell centre with those huge new panels which have names of members of the public on it so what part does your trust pay in getting money other the level of scoped you looking forward is easier actually to get the major culprits behind you at the moment has sculptors have been small fray and the whole realm of things so it 's actually quite hard to get major funders backing you when you actually haven 't got a piece of major significance from major sculptor for example when we were requested 25,000 for the Grand Bennett sculpture I mean that there it up costing well let 's just rounded up to 50,000 it wasn 't quite that amount of money but severe would govern 25 and we spent pretty pretty much 225 lat council donate dollar for dollar but it 's still sort of lost like it 's there it 's an amazing piece don 't get me wrong and he 's a sculptor of national acclaim but we just yeah I just feel like we need more presence that that is going to be great for a.m. we 've got the we 've got flip and it 's going to be absolutely fantastic for actually people understanding what we 're doing and I think get Mormon like we 're getting a lot more feel good from people and getting letters to say what a fantastic town or does to visit because the sculptures are really really interesting and they enhance the whole town we haven 't got an architectural paradise on this town and I thought perhaps we need something else that people can photograph and appreciate so just answer that cancer bodies question you get fifty percent funding from private sources yes yeah yes so fifty percent funding in function a packet yeah didn 't follow that with a supplementary question the comments I get art is in the eye of the beholder mm-hmm where does the trust certain regards of more human sculptures such as hearing McCleary rather than the flips in the fleshing things that a lot of people don 't understand that because the trust ever policy on that I think we 've got quite a broad mind and if people have any any ideas about things like a hairy maclary style we 're totally nationally open to it but I think and I think we 've got a pretty diverse got I think we tried that 's the whole thing we 're actually trying to get more of a balance I guess impairment impermanence as the aim so that we 've got something here fever I mean you go around the world and you see Henry malls and you know I mean that 's just a small example but they though absolutely awe-inspiring a lean layer mean me actually may have possibility to get something I could lean lie we 've actually been over to the lindley Center and have spoken to a curator over there and make Todd and X trustee of the trust is actually quite keen on maybe getting behind us and getting something like oats to sow yes I mean it 's artisan the i behold the beholder and you might like something and I might hate it so it 's it 's what Scott does all about its to actually arouse discussion and you know I think that 's a key player really an art so Christians are caffeine councilman 's morning Cathy 's so I guess what you 're Sam the request is to look momentum behind it to make some pictures for some more significant pieces of work mm-hmm here yeah and do you have any major you mentioned Lynn live you 've got any other projects coming down the pipeline at all that you can talk to us about um it ball we haven 't really got our hopes up at the stage I couldn 't you know a few weeks months time provide if I knew we had more money I could say this is what we want to get so I wouldn 't like to get too excited at the stage but I mean the world 's at your Easter really when it comes to major works there is possibly something in the pipeline that involves a local element but it 's quite pretty impressive based on the current funding it would be difficult it 's pretty much was 25 and we 'll 50 dot 50,000 all up your evening up was quite a domestic work really it 's not as it 's very difficult to get something that 's actually resilient to public spaces you know for less and for it 's a struggle it 's too sad that 's just I know it seems as a huge amount of money it seems small fry but if you actually work it out as to how many ratepayers are our and tap o tempo I think it actually probably think I worked it out we 're better well at the moment it 's a dollar of person you know 25 so something that 's actually encouraged spending and for people to actually come and visit your our town I think it 's actually I think I personally think that 's fantastic and it enhances a whole feel of the area but again it 's oh ok Thank You Kathy thank you for your submission today and could you just pass on their thanks today your order procedure or the sculpture trust if all the good work you do and mmm will be deliberating and come back to you thanks very much thank you sweetie _"

Bill Thompson good morning bill come on come on through and sit down and relax bill submission on behalf of 0 in London nice to see here don 't you just want to pull this arrears I 'm something I like to thank you for the job you do on our behalf I hope to persuade you to change it slightly with your signature well can you just pull the mic around a bit thanks yeah how is that let 's go maybe thank you good again say well done first of all I should apologize i guess that way of meeting procedure and the submissions a really hear some same subject but a rehash of and when i put in front of you last November which is probably a pipe as you can discard this is one just two sides so when apologize for it don 't make a procedure it 's about what this time villages motels and air pollution enterprises its separate invisible or inhabitable portions of private homes residences in other words it 's and for 're going home based issue I please I save it out as a person and Bay 's any other favorite private accommodation as acidic will excluding commercial stuff here purpose-built commercial stuff this is people using their own homes to make a little bit of extra money and when it 's probably about it but it 's time we let ourselves there 's probably a bit of this and it 's an enjoyable thing today and we need a lot of interesting people so it is a list where the total solution extra lights that 's supposed to get there are that the same for everybody as you say that discharges them up then values of any kind and the first two lines define and council terms what a nice you are a real head which is a superb central cooking facilities separate living entrance and bathroom and those as you can see they 're just design features in a house by varying it particularly in the past like top i will it stop around personally up to half the houses are built into storage but in you don 't a bathroom NF as a bedroom downstairs in addition to the same thing sitting outside bill which would be manner and that qualifies as a CRP but i can 't tell you as anyone that design difference means that possess to Stanley masters more the council facilities both of rubbish research the nerves that start the build a Lakes do with a the whole pass at the road which is no doubt is a casual holiday home and doesn 't a chart to this you are a charge whether you can 't make the point where visitors any rate plan otherwise the family can imagine from anyone i 'm standing for a few weeks with mom and dad with each other all use those services it 's live around the sartorius and tapping loves up that 's at the launchpad what type is about as having visitors and talking really often in the process how about is that so but they are two aspects so this is the extra challenge as a new is the LG so gue LG say and cows Philip full charges in visitors we can 't do they not did I share use the toilet and visit is in other hands ran time don 't and so terrible question clear what 's going to lead to some health problems in fact that is what happens but it doesn 't a similar with rubbish they generate the same amount of rubbish way over this time the nine-person poem master to us where the neighbors next day with the family over from Australia for a couple of days some day they share there 's the toilet petrol rubbish up difficult okay we do so ser pays to sameers night Monsieur previous does make really elusive as cancer facilities than any kind of visitors to nab him then if we don 't charge Perry based on dating zone and I can 't fall any other explanation Reggie where 'd you say well quote for you in any pain better stuff in such things as ownership cabinets advocacy emergency management will control the Senate race and our spells are controlled that sometimes wonder Saturday matson and will control what we waited for some of our visitors maintaining a few too Tories these governments and leadership functions and controller signatures or disappear federal knows that apparently don 't shine down kind of the toilet for few days in this eternity record halogen Jeter elec ontology then you 're the same trip it but I do for social there 's a letters so it comes back to a policy here yes you are paperless in summary but method is policies put in place as a solution to a particular situation or perceived problem the existence of the problem is the reason for policy was probably been exceptional at very bad what 's a few names down a company running for president it doesn 't justify anything but try as I might I can see a program that 's peculiar taste you are pleased here so what to make the paper type I charms on it that it 's hosting visitors that corrects the problem that is not the type of building a post and where it is dis choose to stay has no bearing on Hamish I or use the toilet and the rubbish to mostly persist mmm this is a little an observation is particularly it could almost be called dishonest and so far is it challenges some but not others and we repent you know there 's no to the name can actually offer me an explanation are they they 're going to listen to it and have my own terms but if they divide was for sentience are phenomenal and I can 't see any area of missed the point when we start to pull it apart like I 've trying to do here today so they do every time I believe this parse is misconceived and I believe it should be script and Luco the last time can we have to balance the books by the general wrote so thank you again okay thanks for a mouthful reshape your time here today just before you go now sorry it might be some questions from counselors you have any questions of bill regarding this issue love to have some observations criticisms guess the hobby you just clarify how much are you paying and more right but any mystery who 's there 's in 76 it 's a press the percent but that that pervade the best valuation of course is some yeah well i guess about 6,000 it 's about four times that finger but I that 's yes we talking about has been downloaded to 10,000 here this last year I think it 's really odd maybe thetaba see we 're not about thirteen fourteen thousand dollars will take it and then repair techs I love it pays in cash these guys remember ten bucks in cash we love reduced be liberal make an adjustment Olympics and I 'm not to it but that 's the nature of society is not available we can 't America so I 'll talk not against a weak sternum but to Nigerian river the department is that I put a good it 's coming off the crime and UNITA but nor in a pilot my problem now that you feel not everyone is on this but it 's not that I wonder where else to add relevant it I think the other time to a particular sit down behind accommodation yes here are pays which is probably the smurfs them and it miss it means as far as council services guys I 'll go to the toilet whatever I share whatever I want to look up the rubbish and right away and really like start a lot of real places i 'm sure other food is intended to start terms and it didn 't think of charge in andalusia orissa silly but that different design impacts August 's hippo and style for a while to store it so that that 's worth anything but not accident away with tells uptight about the pen toppers all about and visit my store not having visited Stokes and lands end up on that side which discharges abilities but if you 're going to put a tax on visitors put it on every visitor it comes on you have to have told that so nodes but the move is just kind of and just I left you out criminal darkstar it is here I playlist out with friends or bay and bay when I think the hell that I hung up the road to complete house which doesn 't have an issue our place that doesn I people living on Jan spending our dads in town so I 'm not playing dragon others into this I 'm Toronto oh I 've got a vested interest me on one but I 've staying in his name interested i beez i 'll just think it 's not it 's so consumers past just instead of criticism its norms of us are not very good with words so don 't target but i 'm picking holes here i 'll just take a couple down better okay thanks Bill I can 't slow up there not you thank you Bill for that just for my benefit can you clarify for me please are you against a you a GC charge all together or chest a certain amount of the portion of it the extra one that 's a fool if it 's a full charge and then look that 's the others i 'm on earth is this does not today with whatever i do so powerful but this is an extra for extra well do say may be permanent perfectly not no problem paying notes and I her name about and over the best of a coastal the roses the faithful if you behind why our chance and the substance thank you thank you cancer body in your bill in your thank you for your submission and your original when you talked about the UAG at two fifty dollars it used to be 470 and the land value we reduce it if this council at some safe probably the next long-term plan decided to considerably increase the uniform annual charge to say like the kids 16 hundred ninety dollars restricted into the theater was under some sets of 111 ghost riders in the runner goes fairly natural editors and then I 'd have to get my head around that question intent yeah after some higher before ahead of sense my opinion but a document came from Terra as overt old hometown and I have a fairly large EOG salami that was a sort of bothered me one never knows what it was fifty-three years to achieve a new concerned that these are additional charges put of you on you because Alf funny impact statement talks about the issue IPS of pain we 're told that will cover in less than Congress after this you are painting that under the specter 113 will need many residences the residential the home base this year please I 'll gather from something that really would simply just in the last week that it covers rest home villages are those sorts of things there 's your art pays to and at abuse the figures didn 't back it down but i would guess that the residential issue i pays are just a small fraction which taken from that from those challenges not in here what an opposite i vented a goddamn it try for the commercial does that affect their own battles you know he 'll of putting points into phone to write in 10 and 15 about you know that the Jews taylor can just a Turk said kosovo 1.7 so if it can justify to get my prev a minute and rights or they 'll come from the just fun and we put a patent cancers got alone Sam I 'm not into out sat or just I just don 't say in a brother of the same hope so but so I can 't I don 't have enough home open turn to comment on that little duo jiu see how cancer the talents I 'm sorry the chair I 'm thank you for your presentation this morning and I 'm sure you 're a lot more gentle on us and Donald Trump probably I 'm just a couple of just a couple of questions to get a sense of scale from this typically how many people generally reside in your home permanently well that is just too much okay and you mentioned how much sort of revenue you get from from your visitors but how many people with extra people would that be during a typical year for you is probably like a third person occupancy rate oh you can sort of failure return 730 a night for two people we 're taking this year but freedom cars nothing don 't quote me but yeah that 's the last tournaments so I 10 so we 'll have a cop to six people in it but that 's very extraneous toilet looking at about a hundred dollars 40 virgins going to people and just to clarify your request cystic Council to have a look at these charges as regards residential homes private residence just just those nothing else just the home-based su RP with so much they 're living and it 's now going to fit and I got back a long long time I systems still greater threat to the United the last two years and of the RAM suite of extra charges that you 've got there is the one that you feel is more unequal than others I 'm assuming no no no I don 't owe anyone can be justified come know what thank you thank you okay through the cancer Williamson it 's really true you think people obviously have noted quarter you don 't see any reason any apparent reason at all for the issue RP and usually the silence know you meant your period minute in the context but you probably suggesting it still the unfairness of it epsom and foods I 'm not capturing here everybody at preps would be subject to the on my submission limited amount of hot metal standard and now just said before I 'm not trying to get an opponent for that I 'm suggesting what home-based a COR pays should be just write it as a residence just out the velo up the routers it takes just as really customers own yes is it is you are paying the bill in those type 4 5 6 people I was it suggests you 're braising point of should just roast myself you just my 30 one of the things that stated in their policy to remove the sink on the kitchen that doesn 't become an issue IP to you would that make any impact on your credit situation now you really prepared to pay for oh so your car for st. get a new spoke to me and block it again and just carry on business as usual and it 's an option for not going to type but yeah that 's son no i don 't know i don 't see why should have to us this is this is this a trial court 's a leave but this your pain the pain it 's not and it 's its effect and the research council database and can look at a house no moleste the ratio our pace no question about it and they 're not cool to list it they 're not Travis I gotta rip them although I didn 't get a letter from tearing open some how about my phone today just that somehow provided names and addresses or decline that results but time now is not to cut to get the ones who end up in court at the moment and some of them should be feel like according to catch the person it just sure just like in the other day in day time my passion we don 't even know the way out of the band bio just to the bed and I put on a better note that say we did slow unpack your ad on the time when she can starve us right on the town of the cafes and the basil you know bang stuff just asked the officers prep so what stage is the sort of to alter the house or something like that how how do we how do we find these clients that have got that need to be charged these extra soaps right yeah that the summer yep primarily through building consent data and whence a new house has been built you sit and see that and that the team does do a little bit of research on websites to see what has been offered in the marketplace and we knowledge the absolutely correct we would not be capturing everyone but the team does the best make it slightly recently I approached officers of the council regards of one property to be marketed by haircuts that was paying as extra rate but it was not self contained because the bathroom facilities were part of the private house that I believe that 's been adjusted so as we 've had by the submit have been pointed out to us there are inconsistencies in our policy and that really needs to be looked at so by appreciation or submission thank you joy all right okay thank you very much bill good to see you and be deliberating these in a couple of weeks so we 'll certainly be back in touch but thank you second time you 've raised the sake preciate sure you listen unikey _"

Ariel King nice to see here today we are going to receive here the submissions that you 've received on the consultation document for the in your plea in 2016 17 um you received those submissions last week on the Tuesday we also included the feedback that was received via social media or email those comments we weren 't considered as submissions but we thought you might be interested in seeing them so if we include them for that purpose um the other thing that will happen is that we have deliberations on the 7th of June so it will follow on from this from this process and so these two resolutions the edges before we get into the detail so the fuses the the submissions be received we usually receive late submissions so I had intended that we we haven 't received any late submissions so we don 't need that resolution anymore so to speak we want to move those resolutions before we move into just some general discussion then hearing the submitters okay just item there so number one I think it might be best to receive those submissions once we 've had the once we 've heard the presentations thank you just before we get into those so a miracle that we had our consultation document which we now through a consultation that was out from the 4th of April to the 6th of May in total we 've received 30 submissions in of those six submitters have chosen to present those and loosen yourselves I just wanted to take this opportunity to remind you that during hearings is an opportunity to listen in in ask questions in to refrain from making statements and regards to some positions that you may or may not hold on submissions at this point in time here to here with an open mind and that is important so that each submitter is able to have that opportunity so today front of you we have the first person scheduled to speak it called a person I 'm but mr.

    "text": "okay thank you dipping here for that item item number four Great Lake walkway footpath extension funny Walker so I 'm a hologram of Andrew Bowden so and so you record that we had a workshop on this person I think it 's a really exciting project this one it 's some real great potential is on the fourteenth of March we did a side visit we did a workshop Andrew outlined some some options the report outlines as options and there are at thats workshop it was also identified that canceled received NZT at New Zealand Transport Authority funding to to assist with the funding of the footpath and there is a shortfall which is identifying the reporter 147 thousand seven hundred dollars exclusive of GST so the purpose of this item is to outline some opportunities to fund that that shortfall from development contributions and also we need to as alluded to in the previous item need to tweak if we were to proceed with this project that tweak the reserve management plan because currently refers to a grass path as as opposed to a concrete path so you join in in mr. Bowden as in hospital yes is pretty sick I spread some this morning is not not very well slow okay if you can pass on here very good alright any questions please so far mr. read the guiding this item right we straight forward okay so there 's a suggested resolution there do you know what I hear less congested resolution Jerusha Thank You councillor clean seconded by Councillor favi so the table we going with the option of the road in the walkway yes that 's right yeah that 's right what be moved and seconded thank you all those in favor please say aye inched carry item number five Staind item number five through review of draft statement of intent received from Council control organizations small campus to see it so in the match meeting you receipted the draft statement of intent from our 6 C cos um you then instructed us to go and to review these on your behalf and then also we had a workshop for the DG lt1 for you to give any feedback and we also requested if to us so we 've had a team of of us going around doing these reviews over the last month or so and as you can see there 's not a huge amount that council really feels it needs to feedback on these at this stage um local government local authorities she had services less we were satisfied from officer perspective with that statement of intent and but place we did have some concerns you 'll note that on page 58 and we 've been involved with place for a number of years and it has delivered some significant benefits to a council today however I guess as times are moving now we 've joined with all of government and there are a number of other contracts that are providing better value for the District Council so we have been shuffling that around we are pulled in two directions so we go to de les which is the shared services at the Waikato as well as pop this so basically what we are requesting that Bob less do is to yet to reflect the changes and the shared services and y and that they look at an opt-in option where costs a bit of spread across the council so we we 've done it obviously we do reviews of these and there are a number of areas where I think that they can rationalize those expenses better so there 's the feedback we 've got on bot place taa there is no feedback on that one that officers felt was needed d g LT similar position which i personally am quite pleased in some respects for because it shows that we are actually working far more collaboratively with our CCO is that we get to a point that we aren 't pushing things back strongly through formal items and then local government funding agency again we are satisfied with that statement you 'll see on all of those that the timeliness was other than a legislative timeframes for all of those so i guess now is we 've got a resolution proposed resolution there however this is an opportunity for you to add additional cometary should you wish to through those statements anything okay thank you mrs. Walker any questions 'd like it so you mrs. Walker not looking at you though I 'll move with the resolution it 's been moved by councillor Williamson thank you but you can just make a couple of comments if I may please number one is at the recent local government reforms session held by the minister his name escapes me at the moment but it 's a complicated name there were suggestions of closer economic relationships if you like between various organizations such as pop less and less in different regions I think something to be cognizant Dalton the future is that we incorporate some of the central government 's desires to have even greater cooperation and collaborations than what we currently have in order to provide better service infrastructure if you like and cost savings to our a pace that 's number one number two on the taa is that s and when in the future our tourism numbers grow particularly from that from Auckland is perhaps that that we need to allow have some funding in our next long-term plan for possible extensions to either our infrastructure such as the greater tourism numbers then it capita and concurrently accommodate you can surfaces so I decided the cheered to Catholic risk and regarding the taa at any works that mainly be needed to be done on the terminal or luggage pickup drop-off area or whatnot and as a 50-50 relationship with the crown and we 're quite proud of the financial position of the airport but um yeah the long-term future of income streams that whatnot of the airport are definitely something that we might like to see in the LTP just in response to that it wasn 't a criticism as much as an observation that there are times when the airport building is working right to capacity and I guess it 's something that we need to look at in the future to provide sufficient capacity if and when the attorney number scribe already on our radar turnigy cancer got seconded by Councillor cousin yeah so moved by council willemsen any other commentary all right all those in favor please say aye it 's Airy _"

    "text": "item number seven making the trade waste by law and general by law number one suite of bylaws okay after mr. Nick Carol and Jane budge on the cheerless having any Babs moon guys you wish about alum I 'll just cover off one issue to start with and then I 'll hand over to Jane who 's the expert in this area I 'm some of you will have received a copy of an email from mr. nibbles fin which i forwarded earlier today some of you won 't have got that so I 'm copies been printed and is being tabled and passed down hmm excuse me that email raises a couple of issues and suggest that there may be some legal problems with you adopting the fire laws particularly the reserves in public places by law as recommended by the committee that went through the whole hearing process um unfortunately with our legal counsel away I 've had to go outside of counsel so I had a brief discussion with Tompkins wait this morning and sought their advice there 's an email containing that advice which is are probably three key points the suggestion and the email from mr. nibbled stone is that you 're not in a position where you can create a bylaw which allows cats to be on reserves and if he 's pointed to the offense sections and the reserves act as the basis for their decision as you 'll see from the advice from Tompkins wake that 's not actually the case in reality in terms of a legal position in the offenses section and the reserves X is these are some things which you 're not allowed to do unless counsel or another Authority which is in charge of the reserves allows those things to heaven and that 's exactly what you have what what the committee is proposing you do through the bylaw so the pile or calls 22 says that thou shalt not have animals on the reserves except for dogs and cats that 's essentially what you 're doing you 're allowing an exception for dogs and cats to be on reserves and as noted in the minutes which you which you received earlier there are real practical you are able to do what is being proposed second pointers from a practical perspective it makes a lot of sense it 's nigh on them unenforceable to be able to chase up individual cats and their owners every time that they venture onto a reserve it makes no sense to pass a bylaw which you have no ability to enforce an any pragmatic way the third point that Lachlan Tompkins weight makes is that you also need to have need a potential basis when you 're regulating over the top of people 's rights in this situation there is not an evidential basis which is being created to show that cats are the scourge of the earth and therefore should be prohibited from being on reserves so there are those three events which have been raised by mr. Neville stone and addressed by loyal Oakland mole dhoni from Thompkins way I 'm happy to take any questions on that any questions about the Bible 's in general are probably much better directed to Jane who knows them inside now okay thank you Nick any questions of Jane or did ya go sir stuart I 'm just a Christian on the wedding ring and because we have said dogs and cats and should we I 'm just just as just a question about should we put domesticated cats because then of people want to get rid of feral cats then they 're perfectly at liberty to do that does that make sense yes yep just to clarify that how do you tell the difference service tumor between the two if you if you tripped cats and only need to do what you would know that if you had a feral cat or a domestic get what I think all right so Williamson did you have any college aside pair with you know who owns up the fuel kits it 'll just scribe me isn 't it wider once it 's nice to my picture buddy wild in Cannes species oh I did do be doing sorry how did you want to say anything general I live that sir I would agree but yes I wouldn 't agree with the corporate solicitor here he 's suggesting domesticated dogs and cats I 't taken care of by the control of dogs act and I wouldn 't want to get it mixed up with the act I just purely because I 'm not on that committee and and wasn 't um it in different parts where it 's about and people can you know approach the chief executive if they think they 've been wrong done wrong by or whatever will be delegated representatives being blanked out and all their vitals was there any it is actually superfluous to requirements cry effectively you employees the cheap chief executive his delegations sit out separately yeah okay great thank you I just had a question from guards of the skateboard being areas I happen to be on the lakefront over the weekend and I notice a number of people on skateboarders moving at pace I 'm just wondering with the new section of lake tears could be part of that because it 's really just belong to fury road not further south we 've got pretty strange we 've got ciphers now we 've got skateboards here they will be covered by that met with exact map out of the current requirements if you are intending to actually widen the area we probably need to go back out for a public consultation to actually am state that the time you actually here 's widening those same restrictions why don 't we just put the sign up and wait for the reaction themselves we made a mistake would you like me no one 's game enough three mr. chairman ball outside oh yes as I see your point post to fight or treaty settlement we 're going to need to look at their boat hard anyway and I 'd say there 's probably a time to then include it given the advice you 've had that we have to go back out for consultation so it 's um it 's one of those ones that we can address in the near future morpheus yeah yeah it 's creating yeah okay all right these are suggested recommended resolution on seven bar 613 tool well just one question through the chair I 'm question to Jane when we had our hearings we didn 't discuss fees on the that correct no that 's the current ones that have been set but we do have to relitigate those under the new letter by law and the letter X actually quite clear and there 's a process that you must follow or so this is just following the processes okay thank you could I just check that if we get query simson nevilton el officers of the council 's which appear to ask them miss chea will published because we do get a few phone calls to make you learn that listen okay watch try to move within please thank you cancel of a be seen if I can stop Christoph 's key one for each or 12 all those in favor please say aye against you carried _"

    "text": "right number three if I could ask counsel ahem thanks to you can delete the Chamber 's shallow chair from be I don 't have a Kiev it up there enough okay here we go okay some guy Nazi oh well this has gone through workshops and previous council meeting so it is there any other comments you 'd like to draw our attention to I guess there are a lot of words thing and the reporters there often are the key the key issue for you to get your heads around is whether you wish us as officers to proceed with physical works on the reserve I 'm given all the deliberations you 've had to date or whether you wish to go out and seek some further community views to cle around the extension of the road to the eastern end of their reserve that really is the crux of fusion I guess from my perspective is the question that I keep asking myself is in view of the fact that we had a legal challenge to the process around us already what which particular of one of under the circumstances I guess just to clarify two points first of all I 'm not a lawyer so else I 'll be careful I believe he 's on holiday lucky bigger that some secondly as understand that you haven 't had a legal challenge you 've had some correspondence which has suggested there could well be a legal challenge if you don 't make the decision that 's being sought in terms of looking at this issue the safest path I believe the absolutely safest path is to go out and consult the community specifically on the extension of that road in the reserve area and the removal of the chain that would remove any question about whether you had fulfilled your responsibilities in terms of consulting the community and seeking their views similarly it could be argued that that some that 's going over the top above and beyond and that 's very much why the paper is being drafted the way it has to give you a number of different options as ultimately it 's a governance decision about what views you believe you requires to make continue with your previous decision to remove the chain then we 're saying consultation as as the safeway as a must if you want to change that decision that they didn 't obvious course war mean that you don 't necessarily need a consultation again so there 's there 's no right or wrong answer it said there 's a process that we were a mechanism that would wrap around if you still want to make that decision that you previously indicated that you did just clarify in my for my peace of mind the correct procedural thing at the moment would be to to abide by our district plan policy just pick up on Garrett 's point in answering yours and you have a district plan which has really ghal requirements you 're obliged to meet those legal requirements that let 's bet so given them and we 've assumed that that 's are given in terms of the decision making you 've made to this point in time I think the first thing you need to decide is what outcome you want and then we can advise you make sense work out what it is you want to do and then we can help you get to there for the safest most legally secure way as possible accounts with there are three options and this pros and cons and advantages and disadvantages on on those three options on two and three I think I am fairly clear in terms of what those advantages are and the disadvantage particular just to have retraced raised the question regards of that management plan for 2008 doesn 't specifically I don 't believe mentions kinloch we have on page four bar to the policy implications and once again below another subject we 're going to be dealing with later talks about have ammo and grass surface is there anything in that policy implication is contradictory to the 2008 preserved plan i think is as a council you 've discussed previously through them obviously through the hearings process the reserve management plan talked about permeable surfaces being utilized in the kinloch situation much as it does in the for a walker situation that you will talk about in the next item but that management plan if you decide to go down the road of making the road a non-permeable surface so that that 's a very minor element and the whole decision-making process i believe that the key thing is i mentioned earlier is for you to clarify exactly what the outcome is that you 're looking for in terms of with you wish to see the road extended whether you wish to see the chain removed or with you wish another outcome I think you and through the cheer I 'm actually in preference of option one being that we do go out for consultation again I mean I mean the district cleaners quite a novel and but I was unaware of the district plane rulings around the poplars planted along um lakefront aitken lot in the four-metre and exclusion zone of packing around those trees or whatnot so I don 't think we 've actually gone out and consulted on what is definitely technically correct and because this is a long-term project and we need the best outcome and becks fear I feel most comfortable so I 'm happy to move question that possibly might be for mr. green just in terms of funding this project would this be a candidate for development contributions considering the growth out it can lock I guess like a lot of development some contributions projects there 'll be an element which is related to growth and there 'll be an element which is not i would suggest that the protection of the existing trees tho those notable poplars is something that we just required to do and it would be hard to tag their back to growth however I think there is an argument that the that the beautification of the reserve through landscaping and particularly the extinction of the road and parking facilities could be linked back to development contributions and therefore open up the opportunity to use there as a funding source thank you I would support counselor parks option one two as well thank you John Tom to put a bit of clarification on page three back to this business of sealed road what 's the next you say about nullification just forward of those under stress I need a season ticket proposal that involves a seal road will require a minor amendment to the reserve management clean so many of the reserves were to be closed at all to all vehicle the reserve mental pen would also require amendment if they 're not that the community and their comeback or a great majority saying they want the whole thing open to the public but to say well the cost of trees roads amendments if we closed it down what would be the outcome ie no access to vehicles so if your decision was to completely close the reserve two vehicles we would have to make them amendment to the reserve management plan we believe we could go ahead and do that without further consultation given that something you 've already talked to the community about and sort their views on we would simply need to pass a resolution which would amend the existing reserve management plan to bem be in line with your decision-making process you know through this year just falling on council board his comments regarding the high interesting maintaining it open for parking etc of excess that 's out further consultation because of other all the others smooth assemble wall motor filter been mislead or misinformed of all posts here so just doesn 't particularly this remainder decision is binding the stage it 's just a consultation process there 's no further comment removed it might just ask the question it 's sort of semi related to this just recently we held a jet bike and jet ski festival out there is there any feedback from any of the property owners as regards to that not from the not from the property unless there was resident the residents association had some comments blues more about our communication of that event so yet nothing nothing negative or positive to be cual nothing relating to to the actual reserve which is the reserving that we 're talking about at the moment in relation to negative positive feedback there 's a little bit of a feeling that on the one hand we 're doing this process but allow in that event but I didn 't feel much tension there really they were generally quite supportive of the event there was quite doing perineum work very well managed as well never he so any favorite questions cameras please it has been moved in seconds I will put it to the meeting all in favor or against motion is carried _"

any additional money and it just seems a shame to just not take advantage of that I believe yeah absolutely and it can also remind the meeting that our last council meeting we actually said the cost would be between two and four thousand including flights and accommodation for his wish of me on one staff member for now being told that the ceiling whatever is paying for it I 'm very unhappy with the waiters at the moment charging opposed concession to I suppose for council how it 's perceived like camp by public and election you through the field you know your digit is just totally disagree comment was a gracious offer by by the Chinese do too there 's and i think is it 's really something it 's des to represent the community we 've been elected as representatives not officials as such

not on the system is reserved that on the district plain layer they have a reserve overlay on them yes that 's just a just I don 't know it 's just a funny little inconsistency that 's happened through the mapping system that we need to tidy up in the owners of their land owned so they would not be expecting it to have a reserve overlay on top of it and so we 're just hiding it up because it 's not me to be there yeah it 's just soldiers what happen is actually very clear I 'm sure they would do it it 's part yeah it might not have even even come up no I might have not even noticed it notable tree and crafts for terrorists to be you taster yes we did and so apparently there was someone drew isn 't it in vm try to light it fire so they had quite a good good go at it and then it hit to be removed because of her health and safety reasons and the guys did have a look into it and they 're pretty sure they knew who did it but there was just no way of being able to prove it so that 's the two of them these ones one still be a low property yeah one still here and the other one now just a stump with their own private property the carry for five years ago yeah it 's a way where it 's a week while ago that it happens oso military treat winners county met on the wrong side okay let 's pretty sure food needs to be addressed some Americans right sorry Rosie I know that we just do a small review of the district pants moment just thought just sort of started me thinking where are we add without rolling review of the district plan and our discussions on 2013 it 's just that started that book pro citizens tying up second in the second story we 're progressing on TV 2050 we 're at a point where we 're going to get paper terrifying he usually needs do whatever for some real clarity and so coming back to you and having a workshop on that in terms of the rolling review of the district plan we 're continuing to roll on obviously the closest a clean changes other therefore making it a pretty key focus on the individual foot bug at the moment we 're on this the other arm of that project is looking at the the moment we 've got a district plan which is a way actually is about that thick and it 's paper and we 've managed to convert those into PS and stuck them on the website x mark particularly house more friendly particularly in this digital age and if you listen to the government really go past couple of years there 's a lot more talk without trying to become digital the survey is customer as someone who 's providing services customs so that 's something we 're investigating at the moment for you to go out for a request for proposal to give in place a perfect software and they were asked to be so we 've got those two means no strings and waves will just be quite good to get some accessibility at some stage on how we Pacific made yeah one of the key pieces of work we need to get sort of I guess is falling out tini 2050 on their discussion on issues is how we going to prioritize SS review traditionally you just divide off chapters you might do a residential chapter an so one of the things we 're thinking about some hex fighting off all the objectives and policies first and rolling it down and then anything is looking at your individual there are pros and cons in our meetings yeah alright we 're really good yep say okay anything else said Henry you 're our new questions Christmas okay suggested resolution their movie think because I have each single by cancer pack all those in favor please say aye all right yes Gary item number

    "text": "right item number eight adoption or statement proposal of draft fees and charges for consultations necklace Carol worshiping counselors I 'm here for the next three items eight nine and ten which in reality are more like a package to do with the annual plan going up consultation but they 've been broken down into some specific chance just to make sure that we 're taking the right boxes from a process perspective in terms of this first item item 8 and it 's essentially the adoption of the fees and charges consultation should be no surprises there you 've worked through these at a workshop on the tenth of March just a reminder as well from that workshop there are a bunch of other fees and charges that we have as a council that we 're not required to consult on and those will come back to you at June where you can consider those as part of an overall package for approval these are the ones that we are required to insulting okay thanks Vic any questions on the best fees and charges in the case today the castle whatever so you guys in favor please say aye hey guest item number nine all right this one again is relatively straightforward it 's simply picking up the supporting documentation that goes along with the annual plan and seeking your approval for that go out there is one amendment which I have to bring to your bring to your attention it 's a relatively minor one but it could have some significant impacts so on page 33 of your attachments this is in the funding impact statement h 33 section 4.2 differentials sitting in the middle of that page has a table and you 'll see in the right-hand column of that table we 've got 1,000 for a number of lines and then we 've got 1,800 1,800 and a thousand that should be 1.0 not 1 comma 0 and all the way down through that table so all those commas need to be visible points not a not a big one but could have some significant impacts so yes we get that right but other than that there are no other proposed changes the cruzin act on two and three can somebody this also is to do with attachment to is it not there 's a second one talks about attachment to attachment three attachment for attachment to relates to prospective financial statement just the paper I 've given all the counselors propulsion its attachment to see the recitation schedule need some queries on there well yes I expect to mr. Minh Hannah this morning when we look at page 9 and we look at long-term play in 1617 I would assume that the figures near would be from the long-term plan that we passed many months ago whenever it was and if you go down to total rates and revenue which is about halfway down the page you 'll see for 1617 the figure of 60 1782 figure that I 've got in the long-term plan that we just did was 62 million this is saying 61 so I 'm just trying to query as we go through even on page 10 as you see by the list I given you the long-term plan figures excuse me are different than the to the long-term plan figures a reason I 'm not sure at this stage whether I agree or disagree but I 've always thought that if you have a long to employ and that figure States consistent in any of your documentation your change would come along when you look at the annual plan 16 17 this is what we actually said in the long-term plan for that figure and threw a chair there 's one thing that we can 't control let us change to accounting standards we do our in your report each year and its audited by the usual an audit one of the things that they check on is accounting treatment when we did the original long-term plan as far as the rates revenue was concerned we grossed up the revenue and treated the rates remissions as an expense we came to do the last annual accounts we were required to knit off the rates remission against the rates income hence the difference Thea of 820 1,000 between the LTP figures shown in the draft any playing going food and what the OTP was when we did the the annual plan report that with time we did for the 1415 year if we start to the same format of the OTP then we would get a number of significant variances between the Nu plan for 16 17 and what the OTP said we have not changed the numbers what we 've done is change the accounting treatment of those numbers to align with our current accounting policies which unfortunately we have no say in and don 't set but we have to comply with them so any changes has to be reflected in our financials understand that well quite simply where we had 62 603 and the long-term plan that included rates remissions before the remissions occurred of 820 1000 the figure we 're now showing of 61 782 is that 62 603 lists the rates remission so we are showing neat rates and come not gross rates income and that aligns with the accounting treatment so this swap page for the ltp times can fill your age 10 museums and copy your ass mr. Crawford to a system every guard you throw 85 success in your plan it 's probably of a million of 60,000 which is once again another county treatment is that creature this opportunity say from the dust settles shall have a look at the LT three numbers yeah yeah okay through the chair this is adopting a set of financials for consultation at the end of June you will be adopting the annual report so what we will do subsequent to this meeting we will send out free for each of the numbers that differ between the LTP as per must document and the LTP as per the document of frantically line-by-line what the changes are because as I say as known as if you 're adapting the any report I only plan today so it was time for a unit to understand it and giving it further input Jim does the final shot on page nine okay little tepee page 80 in 1617 the total comprehensive revenue and expenses are 94 million but at the bottom of page nine same figures at 13 million so we just spent it the difference but no we wouldn 't be real including this one going on holiday will so we will by the end of next week we will make sure everybody 's got it note that John and so therefore if you get any questions from the community you will have the answers go through the you through that year and so you appreciate all the comments you know it was obviously we all need understand by don 't quite understand why has me holed oh there 's a million dollars extra surplice than the LTV reverse figures thing is an on-set for the last time because I 've been proven to be wrong I suppose I believe if you have your TP figures that stays in the column and then you put it in the annual plain what they are and give the reasons for it I rest of the case all right thank you chance of precipitation soria sense if I under the prospective statements of borrowings we have the figure of our closing gross debt figure can 't find any corresponding clothes and net debt figure we don 't actually show that as a separate number because it that 's just netting off the those figures on 40 hit system of the all TV but we 'll take that one on board as far as CF Fox my last point as I still have some concerns as regards the language that we use and the rates or mission of a proposed policy where I believe it is possible for some ratepayers to believe that there will never ever be a charge to them for connecting up to the m2 you know council hasn 't made that decision yet based on the feedback from the consultation you then revisit your decision and that regard we in fact be able to do that I believe it is part of the consultation document my seller in the next part way I can erase my concern okay Nick anything ever did on I guess the only thing I 'd add to that conversation is that the legislation the local government act requires council to review it after six years regardless so there 's there 's an inbuilt review process sitting there and at that point you can choose or council may choose to progress or to actually say like the people who are going to submit to it don 't know that Jim could also support cam secret sauce key in that regards of the letter we got from lighter to know and I know people are going to say we didn 't know how many people here how many agree with it they do make a condition which is for any reason the future no connection fee would apply at the time of that connection and when we go to the long-term plan revenue and financing policy page 98 it states we also believe that individuals groups in community should pay for the services they receive at the time they 're using them this is important when we go to navigate infrastructure blah blah are we going to be in breach the long-term plan but say no you don 't I 'm sorry I got a little bit losts there can you repeat the question well the question is and the letter that we received way back and it was stated in febri I think we got other march for Lake fury whenever the meeting Omnius said the that connection is one of the reasons they may take the water down there so when I read the revenue and Finance policy in the LTP it believes we also believe that individuals groups and community to pay for the service they receive at the time they are given them are we going to in breach to the LTP no because what you have in the LTP is that philosophy and then in your rates remission and postponement policies you have the ability to say that there are specific situations where we going to deviate from that overall philosophy so what we 're seeing in this situation is across the board we would expect that if people are in a position where their property is serviceable then they would pay a half auto rate what you 're doing through the rates permissions policy is potentially saying to the community in this situation we 've lived there are specific circumstances which mean we should deviate and that overall philosophy so no I don 't believe you 'd be in conflict with your long-term plan thank you alright so stirred resolutions those in favor please say all right I is carried out to number 10 okay adoption consultation document for the annual plan to come of women so I understand that cough it 's been sicker led to you earlier today for tabling the contents should not come as a big surprise you discuss those in the council workshop again the mocked up version was circulated on 23rd a march for comments as i understand it we 've had comments from two elected members come back and we 've made some very minor editorial changes as a result of that what has changed subsequent to that again is a minor tweaking of the section on rates remission which we were just talking about and that 's to place I guess greater emphasis on the subsidy we 're getting government the 1.9 million and to perhaps make it even clearer that those who choose not to connect would not be expected to pay their half charged so it 's about clarification that 's happy to take any questions you may have with regard to that yep okay so just turn thank you us no space plan get you to do that then enough value couldn 't get all the kids into the ban on motion are they freedom camping no don 't get me started all right a suggested resolution that we have the road to see out there and I have a movie place for that cancel what if some think you seem to bug counselor heckling always in favor please say aye instant Perry yeah the tree blocking the view though although I really give your beer _"

    "text": "item number seven executives officers report thinking we should probably tell the reporters word I just want to thank those councils that did consumer-price the meetin endure clarify questions that so that was a very welcome as soon as it approaches and hopefully you have the answers and uncomfortable if you want to react the questions today as well too I just wanted to do highlight two issues one a sudden bar too there is a figure quoted forward to any water supply of 2.1 25 million in terms of the subsidy it 's actually 1.94 to miss the subsidy so that 's an incorrect figure that was taken from a very old report so i just wanted to correct that for you but most importantly i just wanted to highlight the great work that dennis Lewis mr. Lewis and his team have been doing in terms of working with the Regional Council on consent conditions for wastewater treatment plants that working continues to learn to be ongoing and certain projects are being delayed as a result of that work but it 's proven dividends such as the Acacia Bay upgrade work that was possibly being required by consent conditions in the ability to negotiate those concentric conditions to remove upwards of millions of dollars from our predictive budgets moving forward so I think that 's a real positive news story that the work that we 're doing behind the scenes to to define consent conditions appropriate for the situation that we find is actually creating savings and money that we don 't have to spend in the in the next five to ten years so I think that 's a credit to to mr. Lewis in the engineering team for that and other than that I 'm happy to take questions on the report and and we have staff from the room to be on an answer those questions before there any questions and queries of justice rosovsky again I 'll just we like to be confirmation that 1752 under service delivery performances and the second paragraph where we say officers are seeking to address these issues through further work with WRC staff to ensure that consent conditions are yet forty circumstances so we are not in breach of I think you worship on seven bar 18 this is the show brave with our chief executive states that we had 41 events of the end of February 's but on for bar 18 on the second of februari it said 165 which i think mr. samuel is going to explain and then on seven bar 25 deal with the gross domestic product in the gross domestic product per capita the figures i believe all the explanations seem to be wrong once again i leave it in the hands of will to explain what that 's actually saying what it should be saying yes really Thank You wizard thanks council volleys so I 'm through the chairs seven by a chain the 41 events last time reported this time boosters the one in 65 last time and that 's just we had a change in staff over the time that was reported it 's just the way it 's been reported so that the number that you have now is actually a true one so to give you the example last time for example they were killing every single time where is how we 've counselor this timers is that 's just a series of bookings and it counts as one Bruce 's 60 so that explains that 17 about 25 so this one here so the same about 25 at sandburg eyes domestic product so their total nominal GDP that 's reported from Sussex New Zealand and we 're given that figure annually and so what our economists has been doing in the past it record every six months as giving any estimate of that so if we didn 't get that estimate you would just get exactly the same figure every month and so the problem with this one is that they did an estimate one month and then they didn 't the next month so that 's why there 's a change so we 've since spoken to economists and suggested that we keep keep their nominal GDP one just as is because that 's anything else is just basically an estimate and but what we will do is try and full car CD economic growth one that 's what you really want to be looking at to the recent New Zealand so that 's the 4.1 bhasin you 'll see here Bruce 's new zealanders report three there was the the next one was to do with the gross domestic product figures seven bar 25 showed March 15 but for about 25 on the signal februari stated sick team of the 15th I 'll just wondering why does that change was the other question I raised with the CEO yeah so that so that was my bad second explanation of it so that the March 2015 number I 'm so that Ezra bets an annual number reported by stud Sussex New Zealand so the reason it would have been a September number previously is that they are economists has made attempts to forecast at numbers okay thank you hey buddy you have a questions of the chief executive joseph rosovsky three halves or teams of you through the cheer youth oh just interested on seven bar three justly regarding the think tank regarding the cost rearrangements assistance after disasters all this this is in the early stages of crown looking at changing the ratio is a 's a lot of the damage if I was on infrastructure isn 't it in this this is writing like that here yes it 's good of them was so much it was very strong on that one and on page seven about 27 or the word up sexy reference to 2013-14 is that right was it that the right year was it stir with three the targets from of three events in both these areas their life sentence sup de en make sure all right person yes a treatment no I think aren 't you yes yes oh the 2013-2014 that that 's taken out the long-term plan and that just gives you a baseline for what it was before the long-term plan started just use you 've got a point of reference so realize now be in 2016 that 's kind of seemed out of date but that 's the reason y zi long time ago no so trailer and just on Steven bar 16 and just two regards to to dania monkey nor awaiting the validation of the UV equipment by the drinking water since I just is there any time frame that we need to keep team okay that 's out of our hands in terms of the overall time firms from our perspective only two years worth of records to be able to make an assessment against and that 's why it takes a long time is because you have to actually provide a full year 's worth of records yep the first one relates to the view right discharge thing i 'm going to day we 're having it 's this weekend testing a significant vegan tetra gases visitor numbers and it can be a significant amount of slaps down to you have yeah is there any end in sight as you get to the issues we like them to resource contain this chair reference to the biosolids yep we 're currently working with a party looking to treat the bio sell it I 'm not too sure we were it yet i 'll being away for a couple of weeks so i 'm just prior to me going away we had a meeting with that company looking at treating the biosolids on site I know we are working to develop a business case that will be brought before council when we 've gone with the necessary information costs involved and transporting you to thank you my other question if I may is on seven bar 16 and the highlights I am a seed that the complaints received should be no more than eight that under the the last two bullet points we are on 21 in nineteen it 's eight two thousand connections so that number on a drinking water pressure or flow is 21 yes so the that 's 21 in total so I 'm not sure how many connections we 've got them that 's about 22 for awesome as far as smart meters are concerned we had some issues with smart meter said I bet that in rizal I 'm not aware really but what amazing yeah its work in progress and when we have worked out the best solution potentially best solution will bring it to counsel for a decision my last question it might actually require your game Dennis it 's the one on seven power 17 water averaged use is down if I were to now seeing that to talk we have a lobster absent homeowners does that imply that the average water used by our permanent residents is actually higher than what is indicated here this is the average use that includes the high populations this last weekend and you 'll see that not only does it coincide with um the summer months but it also with their high peak population that covers everything and currently it 's sitting at point nine this is probably more reflective of the rain that we 've had over this last summer than anything if you notice you have a look at the peak for January 15 it 's up over at one point one point five do you where is the paper for this year 's I think Phoebe was the peak at 1.21 I saw a genuinely febreze one 's missing from there that was one point 06 thank you thank you cancel Suski someone him something Oh through the tio sort of chloride a couple things just acknowledged the good work the treasure that there were the steering economic conditions with the the interest rates achieving a return or over five percent in the teal investment portfolio as opposed to the general interest rate the investment portfolio about three percent ever so the genuine savings about 430,000 I realized summers due to time about his actual real savings about quarter million dollars so like to congratulate it movin esteem is all right one there is a couple of mr. chairman I 'm I 'm old school and I 'm reluctant to accept change and I refer to seven bar 40 in regards of the kind of bar graphs and boards that we seem to have in front of us one of the difficulties i have with something like this is particularly on page seven bar 40 on the right hand side the black graph the I can 't read the writing that 's blood and then when you come to the bottom of that up and down story buildings we will look at what 's drawn loans that color doesn 't show me whether because ever work along I could be looking at something else it 's the good old days of the columns and black and white which you can just took off it 's nice to see but I don 't believe it allows us to adequately work out exactly where we are but that 's just me and through the chair yes I apologize for the young an ability for even people with glasses on like me to actually read that and that the color scheme will be addressed when we did to change to the treasury management policy we discovered that there was some reporting requirements under the policy that weren 't being met under the previous treasury management report hence we revisited what we were actually reporting to make it a line with the requirements the treasury management policy and doing so we try to add a new way of showing things and you know it 's not going to suit everybody but the key thing is that it now meets the requirements as per the treasury management policy for monthly reporting to council so it 's achieving what else could we put in new things in the report and a black the feedback and we 'll explore whatever changes we can make that still meets our reporting requirements and quite happy for any counselor to email us with any thoughts as to change it I would like to see they can wait I thought you might like the colors color blonde you 've got a problem my name is Tim for me anyway 7 bar 52 and I discussion with mr. banana this morning which is the bow wave expenditure up to the 29th of februari on page 7 52 dude figure down has 6 35 on the second of every when these figures alas given to had 886 and at the bottom for three to six second of February 's 54 577 there mr. Manik gave me a reason for that but I 'd like to hear it again please okay do the information given that the end of four the febrile report was as at the end of December since then staff have done quite a bit of work on the carried forward projects to determine whether the budgeted amount carried forward was in fact realistic and the based the case that you mentioned the major over wastewater I think at the end of December he was about 28,000 that had been spent with a budget of eight hundred and eighty-six thousand as you can see as at the end of februari for this particular report three hundred and twenty-eight thousand have been spent and over in a far better position to say okay the total cost is now going to be 635 so what we 're trying to encourage here is just because these are carried forward budget from a previous year does not mean to say that it 's locked in based on the information is bit like the financials were given you forecasts as to what we see the year in position being this what the plan is what we try to encourage as far as the bell waivers concern is that for it to be more realistic as to what is the carried forward or the uncompleted capital expenditure so ineffectively of motorola 's in the next month it 's been so expenditure that should change accordingly yeah if it 's a bear I were I full casted capital expenditure and respect of incomplete as at the end of the previous year through the cutest on that page or notice than the unbudgeted projects was about thirty thousand dollars not necessarily had to be spent in other words save ya on those two projects due thanks I think the key messages um that staff have taken on board that just because something 's on a budget doesn 't mean to say get spin cancer association for me on that subject and we start able to ascertain whether there were any scheduled flight of the visa Easter weekend by Sancerre to to and from welcome I got that question at lunchtime apparently he was on friday and sunday and I 've asked the CEO the airport to get me some details as to why they didn 't on Saturday Sunday I think it might add something to do the one occurs show but I 'm not happy with the answers are out so far so once we get the full response i 'll share it with counselors see if it was a file on sunday no I 'm happy to move happy to move the suggested resolution chika Dhinka for your hunger and your team or your husband hard work all those in favor let 's be moved by Councillor pack seeing about cancer covers well those in favor please say aye to be in city carried _"

    "text": "item number five tinder contractor three water 's maintenance contract mr. Dennis Lewis good afternoon Dennis then worship castles tender recommendation report for the three water 's maintenance contract which includes electrical maintenance I 'm going to read the report I 'll take us your majesty that 's so sweet just a couple of questions to start with them mr. Lewis and this is a significant contract and and I 'm I now notice that we 've had a external moderator I 'm assuming that that this person took the place of a peer review type of scenario a peer review moderator probity auditors there to ensure that the process was followed thank you in the case of Dallas changing ownership and would be the new ownership company would counsel be made aware of that before we accept a new owners the reason why I 'm asking is we had a scenario not so long ago where Higgins changed ownership understand and because it 's a significant contractor interest in you use we would certainly attempt to convey that information as soon as it became aware often we become aware know and that would could will be via the Friday maelea or something like that did you have any more falafel I wonder whether we perhaps if the rest of the council staff agree with it whether we could have a sort of a paragraph inside a contract that being made aware before it 's Megan happy feel like they will note that am just think you just to comment there will be so where clauses in the contract does as a standard yep through the cheered y 'all wasn 't at the meeting this butcher boy so apologies for late so just I just want to clarify two things that all the figures here are juicy exclusive all the ones that oh and this agenda item are GST exclusive excluding GST yes and why was the the engineers if it was 12.5 including the limited day works well and that the tender amount as another million why isn 't it included in the earth the engineer 's estimate of 12.5 makes allowance for the million dollars within that yeah they works which is something that you 're not able that million-dollar system headed to the conflict are you seeking approval to add that to the contrary value as if they lose a supercomputer and finally I double research into city care based a good New Zealand company and it 's somebody who 's Australian not but I 'm picturing like that but that study care seem to have a very good reputation just sit akira currently owned by Christchurch City Council and they currently up for sale so who who their owner of city care will be in another six months oh he knows you know you see that 's cool little these cancer cousins it 's a party yes thank you I 'm just through the charities and but this morning workshop briefing and whatever you 'd like to call it did ask you about the actual spinned is actually an annual rachel spin for the three water 's maintenance electrical contract and other works associated with it is 2.19 53 million dollars so two million one hundred ninety-five thousand three hundred dollars okay and um of this sort of magnitude that obviously be a releasable around the seems in out there that it 's been given to another contractor at a higher amount but it is in fact our cost efficiency of two contracts being brought together I just would like the right past here that understanding though there were definitely unusual okay Vicki so muddy you worship mr. Lewis if we look at the previous contract they were just feels at home and I believe that 's correct we compared in some with Sam 's was the atender including the two that in there some is identical they will tend it on the same tender document that 's exactly the same basis so that 's two point one would have been an inclusion at 2.19 five though I referred to was that the cost of contract works the annual cost of contract works not not for the Fulton Hogan 's current contract there 's I see that included the electrical maintenance contract and also some other works that are being done that are now included and the new contract through to you worship really we get a report on spells all that sort of thing which and they 're our criteria they all met with in weather or whether it be one hour for our zero criteria was was that a fact that that was was that affected taking account when you have come to the conclusion through your peer review that this is the suitable contract those things we 're considered by the tender evaluation team that was one of the criteria yep thank you yes thank you you worship and that is is it normal to have a five year plus two plus two making a nine-year sort of overall contract or is that one of our largest periods of contract we it is normal to have a fixed term up front whether it 's three years four years five years or whatever followed by extensions of time that is normal the time period can vary within ZTA contracts restricted to three years plus one plus one what is what is unlearned in the council well we have a variety as I said NZTA contracts as three plus one plus one cell in the row I 'm not worried about their contract what is _''_401.27 've just about to say that the road maintenance contracts signs contract traffic markings Romania to rule 3 +1 +1 the previous three water 's contract was a three plus one plus one we 've got solid waste contracts and the order of seven years plus one plus one so there is a variety through counsel so what instigated the change to a five plus two plus two well beef previous contract was okay reasoning behind it was to try and provide a a contract duration that was attractive to contractors so that they could mitigate the risks over the contract period but also not have at that long that had a significant impact on the contractor market so are you confident that this nine-year contract won 't have a significant effect on market it 's currently a five-year contract and I 'm afraid I 've got no crystal ball I can 't impact on there and there are other forces outside of what we do for instance NZTA let the nine years network outcomes contract for the central y quedo that 's had a an impact on the contract time period is app does it then go out to open market after five years say so if even it goes well after five years in say the two plus two after that does it go outside of market yes I got to tendering process yes Collins mr. Lewis one of the primary drivers of combining the one of the day do you have any idea when reading this paper it seems the biggest thing is potentially endanger something that we can 't always estimate that 's great okay we 're allowing a million dollars that were game looks over the five-year column just previously the truck yes we currently monitor multiple early contract expenditures against budgets contract budgets as well as council budgets to make sure that they 're tracking as we would expect one of the larger savings for this contract will be in the proactive maintenance that has done rather than reacting to things they say okay it 's a Christmas yet just a couple of more questions if I may the first one is that I 'm sure that you would have done it but just through Bob less and less connections in order to derive the best possible outcome secondly is that I would imagine that this contract we would be expecting to improve our environmental outcomes such as breaching of resource consents that currently have occurred because we have been reactive rather than proactive we currently don 't breach any resource consents because of reactive as opposed proactive what we 're aiming to do with proactive maintenance is to reduce the number of sewer spells that we occur that occur reduce the incidence of water main breaks that sort of thing and that will having a positive outcome on the environment thank you okay thank you does anyone prepared to move this reasonably significant resolution here today yes okay think he moved by council kozlowski seconded by Councillor stewart and thank you mr. Lewis for the workshop this morning as well and I think Khan 's items such as much disease it 's a good idea to have some point there 's some prior knowledge of this so we moved in second it all those in favor please say aye against Kerry item number Andrew Bowden afternoon injury after only worship counselors the report is as red but just something i 'd like to confirm before i answer any questions is the chief executive officer as monies to negotiate discount from the price of the upgraded transformer of twenty-one thousand dollars so in the resolution at the bottom of the first page should you decide to pass the resolution the figure of 160,000 would change to 139,000 you don 't see those many of those resolution we amazing it just says well mother credit must go to danny girl for you missing you missing a very community-minded and upon approach that will very reasonable and really did try and do a good thing for the community by by offering that reduction so i think we should actually give them kudos for that thank you for your negotiations on okay we haven 't_''_745.069 to the report yet so does read I 'll taking questions of mr. Bowden cancer kruszewski quick question as regards to technology is that utilizing the latest LED technology or are we still using the older metal halide lights are still being some for herbs like Josie for example the cloud but I put LEDs in so LED lights are not there at the moment they 're not cost-effective so metal halide are the ones that we have been advised by our electrical engineer the ones we should be using however in other parts of the work that we 've recently done in Interpol for example the South domain lighting they 're all LED but in flood lighting they 're not there yet ok thank you so just to clarify Andrew I 'm Delaney pack lights as suitable for we went to tender for a super 15 game or whatever they be financial whatever that if a suitable to sky standards of the moment yes they are and a significant part of that is the upgrade of the technology in the high-definition cameras but sky are using some time ago when this projects was his in Section sky didn 't review the lights on delaney park and that 's what prompted the start of this part of the LTP subsequent to that HD cameras came on board the jock Hobbs to rugby this new van and they subsequently brought that for the football game in December last year and they 're basically we reviewed that again with sky after the competition I even went in the van here when that football competition was there and they hiss amazing the what comes across on the broadcast so it is very much part of the new HD cameras that they use ok clean it thank you your worship Andrew just just a wee concern about probably the maintenance and the upkeep of own Delaney port lighting systems because obviously they 're 20 or 25 there was secondhand when we put them up there we are leaving enough in the account to to keep that operational an operational budget definitely yeah and the amount that I 've noted in here that 60,000 that we was really a catch up from the past bearing in mind this project was always good one was perceived as going to happen some of that mentions was kept by here here here so really it 's a large amount of money but it was kept back um because to the decided to carry out the work for that catcher to make sure that what we had there when the competition started was the very best that we could do in preparation for them just so we have an appt canceled we have an annual contract for the liteon maintenance and what happens at the end of every year that 's built into us at management planning as we go forward ok yeah just a question Andrew M being the type of football club being the main aveda major beneficiaries of these slides if we ask for any contribution from them has that been no a lot at the moment though i am i 'm not sure they 've got sufficient funding to supplement what we 've got here we can surely ask them but I 'll be very surprised I just put the question earlier what I suggest you worship you do is give them a decent stain then maybe they 'll cough up some money for the lights ok you can always ask the question if I see that I see the chap over I think other than the right any other questions or queries which is just one on procedure we 're altering the resolution we don 't have to have any formal procedure like an amendment from the 12 to go we don 't fight because you not read the resolution so you can make a resolution as I 'm telling them to it 's been moved and seconded okay cool all right so amended resolution there and to 139 have we got to move it please for the counselor heckling you can apply counselor cousin sorry all those in favor please say aye is against Kerry Thank You Adrienne thank you work on that _"

Walker here the businessman she probably the answer that but the first part of the fing link was that fingerling query that deal now not proceeding I presume that portion of the triple knot I see corrects that will not be proceeding okay the other question was cancelled the other question was in regards to the agenda papers of last month 10 bar for stated that the two persons going from this council would be the mayor and one staff member and that since then it 's change that the believe the Chinese have allowed more people to go so heavenly of the original trade delegation are not going and where do we stand as a council to open to that decision to allow more cost to council other than what I resolution loud so to answer the first part of that question so the resolution was for the mere two and attend the delegation and for a staff member to be advising that delegation since then we 've had an offer from the New Zealand shouting a comedy act Association sorry to fund for delegates to join the delegation these are representatives they 've asked specifically for these representatives someone from the education sector a representative from to flat eat or another counselor and a council officer to join so those are the four that will be going counsel why should last yeah last week voted sorry did a ballot for the counselor to attend and then the council officer has also been selected relevant to the skills we 've done an estimation of what debt will cover the Shang Association are week having on the ground costs and she 'll show there will be some additional cost for those for the mirror for the council additional counselor and the additional officer however we are confident that we can actually cover that and the budget that we did have in the resolution because we have been able to and I gotta make some economies there you could have seen we shouldn 't mrs. walkie so effectively there is one counselor going not to one staff member going not to know so there is one that the mere and then one council officer and then now we have a funded or part funded will be appropriate and description counselor end 2nd officer to attend so do we know what the part funding whether it 's in the budget or not for this cancer will be we have done I 've done a budget for that and I 'm confident that we 'll be able to fit it within the proposed budget for that we originally did for me we should heaven do we stand with the resolution passed last month which was for we answer that question how many of the how many trade delegations any of the how many external trade delegation let me company secondary so if it 's even confirmed at the stage but there are still some to come the question of that of the other council adls lava some iodized we

I wasn 't planning on summarizing this paper but I 'm more than well happy to if you want to it 's pretty straightforward I think and we 've had the agenda today so is any questions or queries of the of the item number three that 's a second technical question for me please this committee will it report directly to cancel or will it a report to deterring a community board first and then to council reports directly to counsel but the minutes also go obviously through to ttc be too too long he took over yeah that 's it and courtesy so good yes so everyone knows what 's going on but it reports the full council thank you can sir stuart is happening their immaturity took over too many as I was just 18 fun look at the reserves and do something with the researchers doesn 't think a really positive way forward yeah thank you can sister cousin so good again there is a gap yes Neil was the other person do we want another counselor on Nero I 'd like from the neck cancer very acquainted here my reason is very root on these sons less the equation of Clarence 's well in his fear of it and his knowledge was really great things his knowledge of parts reservist anything else feels really good grounding to the discussions will you seek in there yeah you have a query then and this may fall into the gambit of mr. hickling on three by three option for can include pima are not members of the council if they have a special skill or knowledge what were those schools our knowledge have to be over to you as a counselor put in the som so it could be do something around t KMOD it could be something have specific about reserves and i think that 's the reason why you 've got a nomination way you do as a specific reserve knowledge so over to you as a council so effectively the person with the skills and the knowledge would be mistaken but he is a council member you need at least one council member to make it pleases a whole to be present for this way unforeseen circumstance maybe can 't make it they can still meet that 's very yeah not accept that okay great thank you can sister were your positive comments and thank you did you move the resolution or johnson didn 't I can tell

recommended a resolution there thank you can stir cousins seconded by Councillor Stewart all those in favor please say aye against carried item number nine is done item number team type all China trade trade delegation good afternoon play by Walker business energy nature the sickness good obviously which in the business of the station ality purposes we looking at tourism during sorry clay was tourism one of them did you say yep so and the businesses pay themselves complete loss thank you okay counselor pack I 'm a full of it the mirror and is involved with the delegation of this nature and I I think it 's great that you 've had over 15 am interested I 'm sure once this is brought to light through it being put through counsel then hopefully you 'll get more great thanks clay any other questions are claimed to know I always have a question on China always I just want to raise that the point I 'm really relates the fact that the delegation we made up of self pays and it won 't been imposed on the council the onion posts that we all have will be the mere going and I support that as the head of this district if it 's a district-wide business community i do question the bit the costing and the reasons forms one other after this for the meter finland nanny i do not believe that to support the progression of the feasibility study it 's fascinating so it seemed to be against that I also have a look at your conference itinerary and I 'm just interested when this delegation meet one-on-one with those persons and tourism dairy and that sort of thing even been I won 't continue but that 's that another question I 've got yes and to answer that second question first and it is a challenge to make sure that we provide value for the individual businesses and that 's what we 're about we 're not about taking this is not a civic delegation it 's a trade delegation and it 's dear to support the businesses to come up to China obviously we 've had an invite to bring a trade delegation up which includes some Civic elements with our friendship 30 Xiao Sheng what we 're looking at doing so basically women rules down if you feel that all in together it 's one day of civic activity the twenty fifth of may and as and then the 24th amazed just in the evening so we 're the itinerary sitting at the stage as we 're looking to head up to Shanghai first meetings within ZTE in fact and a number of businesses and Shanghai through to Hangzhou and we 've got down to shell shown obviously we 've got some Civic a civic day Thea and then we 're arranging for business meetings so we 've just actually hosted the Trade Commissioner and to Guangzhou here yesterday and he 's supporting the delegation in terms of creating those meetings we 're working with the foreign affairs officers for each of these am areas and we 're being very clear that these businesses need to get return on investment and benefit not all of them are wanting to have one-on-one business meetings some of them I want him to go out there to understand China to go and understand the market but there are some very clear outcomes that the businesses are wanting to to achieve and that 's what we 're making sure that we can arrange Thank You ends two men will we receive reports back from those individual delegation members are finding themselves as that something probably no no that 's all I 'll ask for second part of the question so will you receive a report back will receive a report on the connections that the delegate just mirror probably I wouldn 't I wouldn 't look to get each of them to do an individual report themselves for obvious reasons and and I 'm sure some of the relationships have be confidential and that they may make but we will be doing a post post trip survey and one of the big pieces i mentioned before is that we 're doing training in advance and also a debrief afterwards so part of that training is to be very clear on the objectives for those businesses and in the debrief is to make sure that we 've actually achieved those and being able to support those buses will definitely do a report which no doubt i 'll bring up to council after we come back you want just explain to cancel body back running yeah i have somebody couldn 't think that 's pointy to me saying it i didn 't reach in it i think and then a moon piece is again its limit women and david and i went and visited and then last time it was incredibly well-received and it really did help to further 're looking to continue and wanting to encourage this and this project to progress for a very minimal investment I think we should definitely consider visiting attending as well and in just reshoring our support and we 've since we did that visit we 've built a relationship of mutual with the Trade Commissioner and also the Consul General so they 've also offered to join us on their trip so what we 'd be doing is we just further enhance in that relationship in the guanxi that exists between taupe or living in that business ning is the home to the Fang Ling project I mean the penguin project so then you give us a quick update or medals that stall so don 't still in feasibility stage at the moment and and that 's where it 's setting it from the expenditure on that program is well over a million dollars so it 's a major investment in Topal district regardless of whether it progresses further or not it 's still a major investment yeah and obviously we saying hello we want to make you know put it Jimmy well just on that issue have anyone been monitoring the successes of not of that company at the moment with his share markets it 's in the trade I noticed in the first quarter of 15 they had a decline net profit of seventy-three percent I haven 't followed that because I 'm having great difficulty getting into that part of the market but I 'm just wondering how they are progressing as a company in China at the moment with the way china is I understand that they and very similar to you this is not an area that I have expertise and obviously can 't access that but we have had an agency look at look at this group for for enterprise great lake toba on new behalf I understand that they are undertaking a major acquisition at the moment in China and they 're purchasing another large Indian manufacturer which will actually make them the largest mdf manufacturing company in China and in our opinion that will probably actually put them in a stronger position for the atop or wood processing investment because they 'll have so our understanding from what I understand things are looking very positive but thank you just asking people thank you just over briefly on those 1000 tourists they 're still on track to come here yeah absolutely yep vast majority of them will be rich Chinese business people absolutely that that 's the intention yep planet with absolutely over the story that was rhetorical gets us to it I just like to pursue in solution cousins through the up to thanks the due diligence was feasible II study for are you talking about how long sent me going on for now ah thank formally it 's been going off seven months yes which is not unreasonable for a project which is four hundred million dollars i don 't think single thing was you mentioned about costs and here for a mere three to four thousand thirty two people this doesn 't seem very much no so the reason because we 've been out where that Edmund fee will cover a significant proportion of the cost to take the the mirin and clarify for us election year so I assume will economy last time I can assure you it was at the scene flights in five days outside way i watch this it 's only thirty now something is that Palin me thirteen and a half forty else yeah about about it well anyways hmm all right ok this am suggested resolution the m2 and I think counselor pack moved the j cancer and seconded by Councillor stood all those in favor please say aye yeah carried thank you okay thank you thanks Sarah Chloe item number eleven are no amendment to significance and engagement policy so just to be out the counselors so when more item like a never hello Ariel hello good afternoon everyone this our report is just about making a minor Mehmet to the significance and engagement policy it 's a technical amendment so that it 's clear that when councillors adopting a final policy or planet as a significant decision by the expectation is that our compliance will have already been achieved with the relevant decision-making moments in the act very good he real River river tyne stuff in that it is if your policy advisor _,_735.0 happier more in question and for you correct me if I 'm wrong but was it last year that we agreed to a Waikato regional plans nificant policy so one of the things that has been hit me across the region is that we 've been working in collaboration with the other councils to develop policy templates that everybody in the region would be able to understand and one of the projects that was kicked off first was looking at significance engagement policy so we worked in collaboration with the others although we did move away from if you like the general direction that they weren 't so we didn 't necessarily follow the same template that they did okay so it won 't do us any harm being different at this stage okay no thank you I just in the riveting world of policy or what was it that triggered the technical amendment was this something that happened or surface and I was a piece of work that I was doing that made me think about an hour thought actually we should just make the change all right okay okay write me I to number 11 suggested resolution near that council adopts this mean move a casa Truman and chicken to bike chance the Ivy I think either running this time yeah all those in favor please say aye it 's against carried item number 12 Tina yeah we 've been with just some additional changes since the agenda was was printed so the first one is really just making sure that we got the name correct for the ad hoc committee as opposed to a council meeting there 's a additional workshop regarding kinloch lakefront reserve so there 's a closed part initially and then an open open week shop on Thursday the tenth and on Monday the 14th a site visit to for a worker point and that 's in relation to the great great lake walkway and mean a week shop back here and after that site visit and the last one sorry the last one is just a slight adjustment there in terms of the Bible earrings thanks dear and then opportunities conference and professional development of journalist yes I 've had no they become then the last one is just tidying up an error that was made when we adopted the meeting calendar late last year just in terms of timings or local government conference so suggestion to alter the council meeting dates we shall meet you okay can I just have clarification on that where you 've got the council meeting bylaws hearing and deliberation is that the adult committee well that 's a depend one because be the solutions close at the end of end of this week and at the moment is very little in terms of submission so potentially we could have the hearings on the Monday and then have a special council meeting to to adopt them rather than have your ad hoc committee doing that okay yeah so that that might change mostly Atacama see it we don 't really like sure yet No okay thank you yeah okay Jim live in extent i can somebody the first christian mrs. Jake 's is that the kinloch lakefront reserved the first part the workshop it 's closed why and that 's to get some legal opinion to you you and you just review application this is bringing back the legal advice you asked us to go and anything okay i 'm seeking me down at the bottom we 're going to have those changes in council meetings because of the conference i just want to check that the meeting is being changed from the 26th of july to the second of august will contain all financial information etc up to the CEOs report to the end of june and the same with the august one that be correct so 50 we 're waiting for the information to the second of all visitors here to getting it on the twenty-sixth of july so the same information that you would have got on the twenty-sixth of july you would get on the second of august through the chair we can 't guarantee this particular point of time you 'll have financial through the 34 doing because that 's the end of the financial year and there 's a lot more work and reducing that information you 'll have it to end of may even it 's 3 verse 7 even though august are a week as neither here nor there when it takes a good six or seven weeks to do your year-end accounts so the 23rd of August meeting which we now another 34 West will head to the end of July we all have to the 34 2 News thank you all right um yeah so that 's it just resolution via those change of dates do we talk about the local government conference now or do we do that next meeting I will bring up an item okay good okay all right no questions just one of em so I could be account full council meeting on Tuesday 30th of august and when is the last sort of setting date for this trainee amor so maybe it 'll be in September I can 't remember what date we put on September yeah all right okay so it 's still another month you okay it 's all right lovely Thank You Tina all right suggested resolution there could i have a move it please thank you cancer truman

damn yesterday attended the ammo with Gareth we went to the Waikato plan at Joint Committee meeting and it was really productive and it 's at a point now where a draft has been endorsed by the joint plan committee and there will be in the next 2-3 weeks a workshop just to update elected members as to where it set in to seek any sort of comment before it goes back for adoption okay thank you yes

nice to have you here and do you want to comment on the item please I 'm only to say that this is a relatively procedural measure they authority to approve management plans and amendments to management plans sits worth council and it 's not delegated to the food committee but the food committee have heard these submissions they have deliberated they have made a decision on what the change to the management plan should be and have communicated that to counsel in the form of a recommendation and would you like me to read their recommendation out or you have comments or as you can see there that 's the number one yes yeah in the minutes it 's in the minutes that the management plan and be amended slightly to provide for an extension to the existing lease period for the community leases on hip lling park to the 30th of june twenty thirty and that was a pragmatic decision that they talked in order to give those Lisi 's some comfort some security without necessarily giving them the the fall to an extension that they were asking for which would tie their land up for a significant period of time and their management reinforces reimburses there yet call so so so number one on

afternoon tourism sorry clay was tourism one of them did you say yep so and the businesses pay themselves complete Thank You Chloe okay counselor pack I 'm quite happy to move the resolution I think it 's a full of it the mirror and has involved with the delegation of this nature and I I think it 's great that you 've had over 15 I 'm interested I 'm sure once this is brought to light through it being put through council then hopefully you 'll get more great thanks clay any other questions are claims to know I always have a question on China always I just want to raise that the point I 'm very relaxed the fact that the delegation we made up of self pays and we 've been in post on the council the only in post that we all have will be the mere going and I support that as the head of this district if it 's a district-wide business community i do question the bit the costing and the reasons finley nanny i do not believe that to support the progression of the feasibility study it 's fascinating so it seemed to be against that I also have a look at your conference itinerary and I 'm just interested when this delegation of business people are going to have the chance to meet one-on-one with those persons and tourism dairy and that sort of thing even been I won 't continue but that 's that another question though I 've got yes and to answer that second Christian first and it is a challenge to make sure that we provide value for the individual businesses and that 's what we 're about we 're not about taking this is not a civic delegation it 's a trade delegation and it 's dear to support the businesses to come up to China obviously we 've had an invite to bring a trade delegation up which includes some Civic elements with our friendships that I shall Sheng what we 're looking at doing so basically women rules down if you feel that all in together it 's one day of civic activity amazed just in the evening so we 're the itinerary sitting at the stage as we 're looking to head up to Shanghai first meeting within ZTE in fact and a number of businesses in Shanghai through to Hangzhou and we 've got some dairy businesses we 're looking to visit dear through down to Xiao Sheng obviously we 've got some Civic a civic day Thea and then we 're arranging for business meetings so we 've just actually hosted the Trade Commissioner to Guangzhou here yesterday and he 's supporting the delegation in terms of creating those meetings we 're working with the foreign affairs officers for each of these areas and will be very clear that these businesses need to get return on investment and benefit not all of them are wanting to have one-on-one business meetings some of them are wanting to go out there to understand China to go and understand the market but there are some very clear outcomes that the businesses are wanting to to achieve and that 's what we 're making sure that we can arrange Thank You ends two men running themselves as that something probably no no that 's all i 'll ask for the second part of the question so will you receive a report neck will receive a report on the connections that the delegate just for our own interest as we are seen in the mirror probably i wouldn 't i wouldn 't like to get each of them to do an individual report themselves for obvious reasons and and i 'm sure some of the relationships have be confidential and that they may make and that we will be doing a post post trip survey and one of the big pieces i mentioned before is that we 're doing training in advance and also a debrief afterwards so part of that training is to be very clear on the objectives for those businesses and in the debrief is to make sure that we 've actually achieved those and being able to support those buses will definitely do a report which no doubt i 'll bring up to council after we come back you want to just explain to cancel but about learning i think yeah saying that I didn 't treat today I think and the man in peace is again that 's rich woman and David and I went and visited in and then last time it was incredibly well-received and it really did help to further that relationship and I think if we look we 're looking to continue and wanting to encourage this and the project to progress for very minimal investment I think we should definitely consider visiting attending as well and in just reshoring our support and we 've since we did that visit we 've built a relationship a mutual with the Trade Commissioner and also the Consul General so they 've also offered to join us on their trip so what we 'd be doing as we just further enhance in that relationship in the guanxi that exists between taupe or learning in that business ning is the home to the funneling project with the phone line project so then you give us a quick update or metals that stall so that 's still in feasibility stage at the moment and that 's where it 's setting it a million dollar so it 's a major investment in type of district regardless of whether it progresses further or not it 's still a major investment yeah and obviously we 're saying hello yeah we want to make you know put it as a stronger foot forward and to a previous that project Jim for any well just on that issue have anyone been monitoring the successes of not of that company at the moment with the share market sits in the trade I noticed in the first quarter of 15 they had a decline near profit of seventy-three percent I haven 't followed that because I 'm having great difficulty getting into that part of the market but I 'm just wondering how they are progressing as a company in China at the moment with the way china is I understand that they and very similar to you this is not an area that I have expertise and obviously can X is that but we have had an agency look at look at this group for for enterprise great lake topol on their behalf I understand that they and they 're purchasing another large in DF manufacture which will actually make them the largest mdf manufacturing company in China and in our opinion that will probably actually put them in a stronger position for the atop or wood processing investment because they 'll have a larger balance sheet in which to leverage capital off so our understanding from what I understand things looking very positive but thank you just asking thank you just a very briefly on those 1000 tourists they 're still on track to view yeah absolutely yep as majority of them will be rich Chinese business people absolutely that that 's the intention yep plan it with absolutely over the story that was rhetorical gets us to it I just like to personally resolution cousins through the up to things the due diligence was feasible II study for are you talking about how long had me going on for now ah thank formally it 's been going on for seven months which is not unreasonable for a project which is four hundred million dollars i don 't think same thing was you mentioned about costs it 's only two people doesn 't seem very much no so the reason is because we 've been out where their admin fee will cover a significant proportion of the cost and to take the the the mirror and advise for us election year so i assume will be go economy going asteroid 18-foot we flow economy last time I can assure you it was at was soon flights in five days that sadly is if I watched all me 30 now something is that Palin me thirteen and a half 40 hours yeah about events collagen anyways hmm alright ok this am suggested resolution there too and I think Castle Park moved the j cancer and seconded by Councillor stood all those in favor please say aye yes carried thank you okay thank you thanks Sarah Chloe _"

    "text": "right more appropriate probably near I 've done the sex extension of contract road maintenance and resealing bishop soviet zombies make you better have a dream i 'm starting to sound like a broken record again this is an extinction i seeking extinction of the road maintenance contract this is the first year of our three plus one plus one contract and where I will say I 'm seeking it an additional funding for this year and increasing the contract value for that one year extension and you think you I just um I had had a brief discussion with mr. min Hinnant about this but I just the first power resolution is an increase of 750 k plus GST for a three-year period which is two in very shortly so it 's a retrospective amount on an already approved contract it 's not much respective but to it will cover the period from from March through to Jay right so is that and budgeted monies your home for a nun budget no it 's not unbudgeted money it 's all within the budget well essentially what it is that and assess how much the gaps we 're going to need to do how many moles we 're going to need to do so many each marker posts we need to replace and we 've got a little bit wrong to the tune of about 250,000 a year and so the cumulative effect of that is that the contrary we need an extra 750 but it 's within the budget so anything else going to miss out because no so we 're just lucky that you have such a huge effort in your budgets it 's not a huge buffer it 's more of a comedian just just to give classless and comfort because I only this sort of question will arise the cost to the Talpiot would the cost to maintain roads within the turbo District Council is in order in the order of two and a half to two thousand eight hundred per line kilometre so that there 's a reason why I lane kilometer because that 's here in GTA measure and the right arrow and the Bay of Plenty the cost per lane kilometer is in size so would we are maintaining roads for anywhere from two to three thousand dollars per lane kilometer so that 's half the width of the road cheaper than anyone else okay can I just just add to that and usually like with the second part of the reason the resolution about the seven the 2.75 when fifty percent there you go out for boat but it 's not obscene will be NZTA subsidized food as they 758 you 'll be expecting 300 back well own of the road maintenance budget what a spender is fifty percent subsidized sure in CT okay it 's just a question of Higgins contractors say that being sold correct that 's correct they have to Fletcher see you foresee no change and it has been no change so intend to retain Higgins as a bond and specializing and the road maintenance work instructional casa hoechlin mm-hmm I realize this is really quite a sizable contract Dennis because it covers all the district transportation routes I have difficulty in justifying this this increase on the extension of this contract I really do 2.75 million is the actual document and you you do talk about you know five or six items the year that a that of perhaps are identified as as areas with you may have been a little bit short in the original contract but can you give us a little bit more justification because I mean cost of living is only like what three percent I don 't know whereas whereas this this increases is far greater than that but how much more work are you allowing to be done for this extra money that we 're going to approve though the case is not an escalation it 's good but it 's not tired to the cost of living or clusters collations it is purely the amount of work that is required to be done and I tried to demonstrate earlier with those costs pierre-alain kilometer to give counsel or some comfort that our costs would infect me the opposite yeah we probably should be spending more money rather than this money and the work is related a lot of the week and the pavement maintenance is related to what how the when we have the meeting at mahiki know there 's a little road lyrics Oklahoma who rode the significant areas that were under reconstruction which were done as part of maintenance because we 've been delaying doing work it 's those sorts of things there 's been a lot of work done on a building drought in the last 12 months where pavement is starting to fire we need to be able to react to those sorts of things and this is actually doing work on the road rather than is on seat cost escalations through the cheer we 've also got a lot more Road so it 's appreciated I 'm here appreciate the amount of work there is in this contract just uncomfortable with the it is a large contract because it covers the seven hundred and fifty kilometres of roads in this contract and by the nature of it that 's a large a large amount of you Scotty of the VCS an hour in this contract we bundled the road maintenance and the reseals together and for some efficiencies and we seen those efficiencies kruszewski thank under spend on road maintenance in the past few years no it doesn 't what it means is that we are responding to the condition of the road is they are cure so it 's a adjust in time response what we are what we are investing in over the next to us romance is some pavement modelling so that we can more accurately predict what our forward wit program should be and that should give us a greater ability to forecast when we draw up these contracts what the forward works program is going to look like so we can more accurately forecast into the contract warm to the tenders the quantities that are required one of the pushes on a regional basis driven by NZ ta is the fact that although the perception whether it 's true or not we 're still working through when the perception is true that will invest our roads so more than we should do and so sweating loss that is a very popular term in the rodent area at the moment and water which is the Royal advisory technical associate sao tome 's of the work at home apart from a couple is looking at those very issues in terms of if we sweat last set for ten percent lambda does that mean that we will invest later in life or save potentially if you can imagine the size of this budget and extended across the world Waikato you could send save tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars in terms of making those investments at a later time from a tape or perspective we 're learning with the work that 's been done through data to double check with what we 're doing is correct but as dennis is already alluded to the fact that we are right of the betterment of the costs per kilometer in terms of our maintenance but we 're still working with the regional partners to make sure that even though we 're at the bottom that we 're still not investing too soon and when we when we try not to invest too soon obviously there are periods where we do have to invest more than more than would possibly expect because road conditions they they do actually need to be done and I think there 's a bit of this going on is that dennis is great how is your moment ok well what I 'm suggesting is that we just change all that so I mean obviously everyone 's pretty aware of and maybe it 's under way but the fact that traffic coming in and out of top o is now pretty you know at an increased rate do we have any plans on the horizon for extending control gates bridge and widening that piece of road it currently there is nothing on the long-term plan for second bridge crossings or talking about a second bridge I can see how it could be done to my he 'd how much was it for that second bridge crossing dennis has returned to 25 than 30 million yeah 25 to 30 million I had a conversation about this the other day and it was generated out of some letters to the paper or whatever other forms of conversation that we had and in that conversation I suggested that before we were to invest crossing with the UI and so we do have the ability to to divert traffic around if we do that congestion in one particular point I totally understand what you say and so for example where we do have a lot of our external traffic comes along like tears when there 's an opportunity for some signage lack you get an Oakland with 10 minutes to green lane or 15 minutes to Dominion road whether if that was located out on the ETA would actually give you options of getting them to topple in a different way so rather than 30 minutes into top of this way I will tell you it 's five minutes into top or if you go pass on to other parts people that live out my prevailing and that 's that 's growing people felt it would do if we care if we got that external traffic on and hope will down a different route than like toast but it is a discussion to have the important thing is we 've got to remember that we 're talking about a 25 to 30 million dollar 're a long way from having bad congestion other than to two or three weeks of the world was the engineer I 'm not an engineer has anyone looked at actually just extending the actual bridge that 's there like this is a pedestrian crossing on both sides it 's cool people no has anyone suggested doing then on the other side with is another crossing and because there is another biz room for another lane to go around that side it has been looked at the most practical option is on the order of 25 to 30 million dollars and it would that wouldn 't attracting the NZTA funding that would be have to be fully funded at council 's cost ok yes yeah but the time for the time and place for that is to discuss it probably long-term plan that 's right keep the old that fort this is going to have to be addressed at some point you come in a little bit easier to work Pepsi well yeah I have no vision 15 minutes come on I 'm not sorry million limited ok all right got one other concern your worship is the fact that this is still got another right of renewal for another 12 months after after this so this time next year you know any ideas where this contract price might finish what we could do is keep an eye on what contracts are being immortal across the waikato to give you an indication of how prices are moving I think we do do that and I think we might be worthwhile sharing whatever information we have in that regard none of the reasons why we need help team does for a 3 +1 +1 us to keep some tension on the contractor to perform with the and with the benefit of attaining those extra years but that 's where he makes his money isn 't it the extra years only or three and is able to afford managing the contract well which I believe will are nice all right genomic and cancer buddy who are Muslim advice on writing and what a fun interesting now mr. Lewis is the fact that we are asked to put an additional funding of 750,000 wasn 't here when the contract was actually done a firm it was in July 13 you would have gone through the same standard tendering processes we always do five whatever we go through why would we now want to entertain if Higgins are done due diligence and have underestimated by seven fifty thousand and the standing that maybe we have more roads that aren 't is that NT a covered because we 're down here to them would they not have infected them secondly I take what counselor jolons were saying before and regards of reduced costs particular with the price of oil that a referral appeared if we take the increase that 's been asked for it 's 2.6 1,000,000 they 're asking for 2.7 and could I also remind you that this was the contractors that did the lake front foot path which 76 meters has had to be uplifted and today by chance coming back from the hub I walked across the street without crossing is on the corner and two lots of that concrete has already got cracks or it what are really getting to market if we take it out for tender again just what a character flexural one in our case of their social function Hogan that were responsible for the lake side footpath not taking this contract or daughter dating but you get what I 'm saying the 750 for something that 's taken place the 750 s as I explained earlier as for additional works that will require that we didn 't identify at the time we put the tender together when we put a tender of and this cells together we try and assist in many square meters of digger how many square meters of and rehabilitation those types of activities how many square meters of ratio we 're going to take over the next three years it is a prediction of we were going to go what I am saying is that we didn 't get that prediction right we need to do to the value of 750,000 new work on the roads to maintain them in their current condition it is not across the escalation it is purely no vehicle brought in because we now have a different as I explained earlier to also to do with the amount of some of our keynotes like babe enjoyed and paper while we 're counselors have seen for themselves the scope of the rectum ippudo happy guess the cholos I 'm just so lucky your worship I just need to ask for leave I 've just one of my family members is incurred a head injury and I need to go to a NA and see what 's going on get away if thanks cancer Johnson what I think that we can also save here is that through successive long-term plans now we 've significant difficulty trimmed the Catholics budget in the waiting area and you found that where you do trim your capex budget to the tune of and please correct me if I 'm wrong Dennis put 60 million dollars or more removed from capex budgets over previous long-term plans you loved inevitable end up spending more on a maintenance budget it was correct yes sir chris osky totally agree with what that chief executive has said I wonder however is that I 'm willing to move that signal that we would want to go out to for tender next year so we worship just just quickly for worship I think that what we 'll test Dennis with doing is just finding out what prices what 's happening with prices in the workout around and probably the Island because there 's plenty of time dessert bar to build a day an assessment of where prices are going and certainly with that information that will provide you will not be able to decide the yes it might be appropriate to to go out to return the lecture or may not be so let 's let 's only with that information first and then let 's have a discussion down the track as to what will post what possible mobile the work thing to do we don 't leave it too late let us try to say that 's that 's my consume that because I know how long it takes for new contracts to be helped and we 've probably run out of time for this year but I concur with Bernhard to do at least knock out of money so so let 's let slip that circulated and move forward thanks I can surpass it did this to it I 'm sort of a Catholic counselor and burn about it also just gets me how and everything is what right down to the last seat but they just want this rounded figure 2 to the internet contract this unit as long as you can assure us that that money you think has been expended correctly appropriately inefficiently of our live alone I can assure you that I have got two staff members that 's being the entire days managing this contract making sure that what they do is and done efficiently what they do is only what is necessary and what if I don 't do something that is done in the right fashion that they go back and correct thank you thank you very much be moved by casa luna singing to buy counselor park are so the recommended resolution wine are you worship one until that 's a minuted in tho minute yes yeah but we want to have the case of fun yep all right never recorded cuban certainly so so motion is carried but just recorded from councillor john body _"

from the newsletter from April all 68 you okay I 'm to just just for my own information can I please get a copy of the feedback forms thank you sir cousins just gossip that those things to want to see guess they 'd be happy not connect us now for they happy with bosal will they help you with the chat half the judge their question was nice to the question no so if they don 't know there to be a half charged the person platter proposal okay any other questions of assless regarding the slightest term this cancer kruszewski just on the item altogether I raised a question again the people who have said yes are they aware that there will be an additional cost to themselves hooking up or repiping from their property to the actual new water line yes secondly is on three bar 8-under 9.32 how many properties will in fact be within the 100-meter radius that would require them to be all of them one of the pot tool 243 properties that move my turn away none of them will actually get a the consult consultation exercise what we 're trying to do here is demonstrate what the community feel about it you still have decisions to make following community consultation their annual plan as to what you want to do about it understand that the reason for my questioning is dude do the autistic community and what how new you understand the community in water honey we have provided their feedback on the basis that of the last workshop and decision from Council is that there was the conversation around no charge and to change the you 'll help me which policy was it we were looking at changing in terms of the half charged the remissions policy and that was the discussion that we had at the last council meeting so the words only community were canvassed on if those changes were to be made so that then you as a group of elected members are now fully informed as to the best case scenario for the from the writer how many residents perspective rather than the decision-making process that you still have to go through thank you you want to or I I just just summarize what the papers all about and so what we 're proposing what the option is is to a dash for our members buffets the proposal is to put water from table to the complete white home early community and that would be funded through the top I scheme and that the current half charge of the water line passes you a property would be wave and that 's part of the rates remission policy in that the reservoir was to be located on council-owned lead impact on the type all right and it 's the impact on the topo rate pairs if you turn to page 3 by 4 and there is a table rear that indicates what impact it would have on the Talpiot I 'm scheme but again from the consultation document has just been handed out what that 's informing you is that the range that we 're looking at from present feedback from the community is that the worst case in terms of the topo would catch from ratepayers is that they would be from the up to five dollars the the cost range up to a benefit of forty cents per property if the rest of the people in my to handle you that haven 't currently responded where to join the scheme so that was the intention of this information that provides you range of that the range of custom benefit that you are probably looking at in terms of the existing feedback that we 've received okay thank you yes sir pack and yeah I 'm quite happy to move this resolution but I disliked and some assurance that when going out to consult their those figures per rateable property and then the top or and ward would be that BOA will be made aware of those what they could be it you know potentially faced with it 's not just not going to be words well they 're actually showing yep most most suggestion also is that when we go out for their annual plan consultations that we actually physical door knock with the owners of the properties in writer honey and get firm sand to commit one way or the other so that when we the troll figures and we will have the little coastal benefits depending on what those numbers actually her and just fin to their I did speak to the comms manager about the Kinect user to that which why to her new I 've got a bit of a apprehension to the word free nothing in this world is free yes sir chris Oski yes thank you another question that lingers in my mind is that if one were to go through this process and the final answer is yes what kind of presidents will it set for a and sake five mile bay residents and community and other smaller communities that are likely to require water yep we discussed that at the last council meeting it sets no precedent because the intention is in the next long-term plan to have a discussion about district-wide writing which Revere the water skills that we have around the district there is a serious need to have that conversation before any of them can proceed now that 's the only schema on toprol that you 'll actually end up having a subsidy so it schemes so that 's where the last council meeting were isolated out or the last discussions are in at last council meeting where isolated out whitening from the rest because it is a very different case in point to any of the other water screams that would you be considering as Counsell moving forward from here I understand and I 'm and I agree with that next sent that the perception will be totally different from the reality and somehow rather if I were to proceed with that our communications will need to be absolutely top-notch totally cool i think the emphasis on the two-million-dollar grade will be a starting point for pointing out that difference so you can confirm that no other community attract a substitute like this absolutely not everything we 're to ask the question and there is absolutely no more money coming out of government for any water skiing upgrades that 's for javi so the cost to the Talpiot ratepayers of whatever it ends up being would the those in white or no II who are getting the water would they also be paying this around four hundred fifty dollars per property for the topo catchment all right okay and just the process of this I suppose I got up into gym not however few questions cancel our money we do I start sorry what were you been with what a what a fun interest interesting in this whole content they were looking at this starter before most of us as counselors time in our theater a letter dated the in June 13 that was written to the Ministry of Health and what I found interesting reading it out was because of the original this is one of my questions of this 37 38 or 39 properties depending which document you read a part of the district councils water supply scheme does the Ministry of Health acknowledge that the 1.9 million is going to connect person that add-on or part of that originally 39 37 or 38 properties that is why the grant originally was for 300,000 dollars for the 37 properties it was then discussed with ministry to extend that to the whole community to offer the opportunity for the whole community to connect properties it would have ended up with a realtor right for those individuals of something around fifteen hundred dollars each per year which is clearly unaffordable so the ministry encouraged council to apply for a much larger scheme to spread the costs over much larger number of people Ava toprol catchment to bring those water rights down to the level of 450 odd dollars per property to make it an affordable scheme for the greater board rather than a very costly skill for a group of people that could not afford it go to the newest you can just go along in regards to this letter and it talks about an alternative option what it states is this is an attentive option that can be explored further pre please note that this option is neither consulted with community nor council and even though I read the new figures that have been presented with us us this morning how much time do we waste as a council waste is probably wrong way of officers time when a majority of those in that area has signaled years of it 's free but your turn dinners it did in terms of race I mean it 's it 's not for us to tell you whether you should vote to proceed with this scheme or not that 's entirely your decision but my recommendation to you as a chief executive and as a civil engineers that you consider seriously a 30-year impact that this scheme could have on the community of whiter how many and with a two million dollar grant from government on a one-off basis there 's some serious considerations for you in here and I think you should pay them June he 'd again nation is in listening to the community and I 've not engaged directly with anyone from the community although my staff have and they have reported back to me there are some genuine people that went to live off grid in the writer honey community and I for one respect their choice to do that however when they move on and pass their properties to their siblings children just children whatever and as properties change over time Council has the ability to impose what are the restrictions of water ball replacement we 're in 30 years time we could have a whole community on a wholesome water supply which is the long-term outcome so again I recommend thinking longer term them then we 'll possibly are thinking at present cousin so you think council can lawfully impose on a property at point of sale there can be sold not nice around worth council has the ability to pass by rules and make resolutions in regard to its remissions policies and it would be the remissions policies that suggest that you don 't apply the half charge for example that you could have as a timeline imposed within the emissions policy or you could and you could have a resolution that says I 've at once it 's sold this property then will become subject to the normal policies of council I 'm not saying that that 's what we 'll do but those are the sorts of things that you can discuss moving forward because with infrastructure skills council obviously has to recover the costs the best way that it can can somebody did you have any I find of interest in the agenda item of mentions that if we don 't proceed with the subsidy we could be in breach of a contract with the Ministry of Health is that documented here because I would assume that if you decide not to take up subsidy what the penalty would be Mobile is that for me a bit more filler but I would say there 's no real issue in terms of the contractual obligation we just have a no obligation that we 've applied for something that we subsequently then don 't use but I wouldn 't see there to be any penalty per se the contextual applications were outlined on the in the paper and that same paragraph I realize it I mean hello chair just no flashy games on three bar six it 's his council has signed a subsidy agreement failure to progress the subsidy agreement contract would be a breach of contract that 's great so what would be the penalties for their arrange your are no penalties if we had taken up the subsidy and started spending the money we would 't spent any money thus far mr. million over later hanbei if you look at the bigger picture is a need for a water scheme heading out towards whiter nuit we 've got the triangle block which we 're looking at marketing you will see by that hand out there is a school at white and early that the water is so bad that they actually have to take bottled water into the school it 's a matter of whether you say this two million dollar subsidy enables us to meet a bigger picture solution and just this little whiter newly community so I think take a step back and just look at that bigger picture and so really this consult on the basis of what our future needs are okay any other questions or queries of firm guess I Harvey I just like to concur that we 're just got to be careful that we don 't make a decision just based on now and a lot of people like the residents included probably are just thinking I don 't need it and I don 't want it however know there it 's like anything lots of demands are going on at the moment over all sorts of changes do I say it Flags amazon and legs but you know like lots of people just make a decision because that 's what they think and they don 't think about others around them and what might be needed for other people you know we have to be careful that we 've got to make a decision for everybody and you know some of these people probably don 't even know that they need it you know it 's the next people come here long that might need it and we 've just gotta think ahead thank you can savvy all right um so there 's a recommended resolution the year which mr. Chen village it moved by cancel Parker just finish off I accept what mr. Manahan and says but at the last meeting we discussed if persons wish not to connect up and there might be five or ten years down the track what sort of when none of us have discussing it what sort of payments will up now well again I think that that 's something to discuss when you family vote to proceed or otherwise with the scheme but again I emphasize the fact that a lot of the people that don 't want to connect have their own bills and they 're perfectly happy with their own bills even though from our perspective we know that those boys do have higher levels of arsenic than out certainly our town how do some supply would have will be faced with a community that doesn 't want to join a water skin because they believe that they are perfectly adequately served the question then falls upon yourselves do we want to force a community to do something or do we want to work with the community to achieve a greater good in terms of achieving that greater build those don 't last forever so another opportunity could be to say once those beers are replaced because people need to apply for a consent from the Regional Council to redraw a bill if those boys are needed to be replaced you have the choice of a one-off ball but after that point you will therefore I on the future and so you have lots of different pinch bolts or lots of different contact points in terms of that community to force an issue down the track but the key to get the skin in the ground is to not necessarily force the issue at this particular point in time because as one of the counselors has pointed out a longer 3230 you aware of this sort of issue is that those people that today don 't want the water and possibly don 't fully understand why they don 't want to run the water will be different decision makers in 5 10 and 20 years time Castle hoechlin second the suggested resolution your worship okay so I 've been moved and seconded does anyone want talk against the resolution well I don 't want to talk against that we 've talked about the ability of that community to pay hits the subsidy and I look at it small community within the top area why Ricky whether they will have the ability to pay whether it 's a year so I 'd like to have those factors that if we do pass the resolution that they 're available when we get to discuss it in the annual plan hearing so we 've got all effects and all the figures just to support councillor bodies comment I think I 'm more than happy for this to go out for consultation and for the wider community to comment on this but I think it 's really really important that we 're very very clear on the facts that we put forward to the wider community and we don 't just say we have to meet the drinking water standards the drinking water standards say you need to take all practical steps and in that mix is cost and affordability and what harm would happen if it didn 't happen so I think those facts need to be presented in a clear manner to the right path so they can be an informed decision and on that basis i 'm happy for a consultation but not leading down a path ok i just want to comment on that because there was are 37 properties that we have an obligation to upgrade to a wholesome water supply meet the drinking water standards so we have an obligation on weiterhin ooey and it 's one that we can 't avoid these all practical yet irrelevant there are no all practicable steps when it comes to council run water supplies replacement and upgrade of the school is the only practical option that is accepted by the ministry I would debate that castor cousins yeah wait its face very well just I mighty I don 't want a sort of a go for call the consultation either minor concern is that we do treat people with respect they do know what they want themselves and effectively talking about we 've got to educate them it 's probably little bit 50 we go trick careful with that that 's me we don 't want to be going out to them was the one the best that 's but we want what they want rialta mately I think so yeah I would support the resolution all right okay been moved by Councillor pack seconded by Councillor cling to it 's pretty clear there so we go out an annual plan process for that will implement we are able under the long-term plan i thought the x is minor amendments this is a major amendment in our rating policy confirm that it 's not doing to be a major L to permanent the fact that we 're now going to have have one part of a community pay for another community to have water by writing existing community is not a large differential in the radiant palsy to the tune of a potential maximum five dollars per property it 's not deemed to be a significant issue but earlier maybe ought to have some comment on that a few so that scheme students at a five at eight sixty that was in our gender papers is incorrect again we will consult on that basis but with the feedback that we have received two so far we are looking at an envelope between five dollars negative for the top or a player or forty cents positive for the toefl ratepayer but the full figures will be disclosed during the 's not a major can be handled in the annual plan it was also it was also part of a long-term plan platform was that we will consulting with the writer hungry community so we 're just continuing with that consultation exercise as per the long-term plan okay thank you thank you everyone it 's been moved and seconded all those in favor please say aye hi as against carried so children could have just make me out now make the comment Peter BAM came out recently and said no more subsidies to small schemes I 've been talking to Western by a plenty on this issue is it not time that yourself and the waikato me has got together it 's part of the mural forum and look at what smoke schemes are going to be facing the council 's may or may not have to pick up yes what kind of Mars in fact national laws have been campaigning on this for well over a decade probably longer probably 20 years there 's been campaigns from local government using them to obtain more subsidies for water when one fifty percent subsidy for four decades or some good approach to a century water has had very little government money put into it so those campaigns have been had for many many years I think the issue and the response from government at present is that ccos operated on a regional basis asset earning CC loans are the way to fund that funding gap and that service provision so if we were have a debate at a million level with central government on that issue that debate would revolve around the regional response in terms of an asset owning CCO with that sucios ability to borrow against a far larger balance sheet Cohen family or dot and therefore be able to construct the works that need to be constructed by spreading the cost across a whole region so it 's well and truly underway as that debate it 's been hard for many many years and I for one will certainly pushed up debate as I 'm sure mr. mayor will be pushing that discussion as we travel around both the New Zealand when the region mr. chairman the reason 're not mentioned water New Zealand 's comic that was put into the information we get on a two or three times a week basis from water New Zealand also indicated that small accounts are the council 's were pushing back on complete compliance and told me to remember water New Zealand this morning who is a staff member of Phi of plenty here he 's the utilities manager is also on that committee and they 'll be taken up we 're going to delays with him it 's a local government group to get a good outcome okay when I was on the board of horse and resume the push was for regional CCOs to do with that issue so I don 't know where the New Zealand 's change their position but it 's only two months since I was sat on the board thank you okay item number for extension of contract Dennis just over a year striegel at maintenance see you next in order through the floor mats for their contract with Nolan grease of the contract costs the reason for that amount contract the second months ago we didn 't used up all of the moment okay any questions hmm through the columns mr. Llosa just to confirm on this particular item regarding street light maintenance there are no cost escalations required for this contract there is included within the amount that 's essentially what 's happened is that we haven 't done as much in the way of replacing bulbs and that sort of furniture in the last 12 trading constantly anticipate the silencer kruszewski on a technical question last year I think I raised a question of replacing bulbs with LED lights are we on track Ledet we are looking at a replacement with LED lights once this contract expires so this is the last twelve-month of the contract we would be looking to see what opportunities tomorrow an extra high maintenance contract for LED replacement there are a number of different funding bottles he helped me into the neighborhood thank you we will in terms of LED light replacement we 're also working with EK and waikato less in terms of developing a scheme to improve the quality of light in through 've got a spear 30 minutes and more than welcome to be chewy is about and what we could reveal question that didn 't say any we ring in the street lights are out like when there 's a virus I match is about you is to to be now for about six months you ring the customer service center if it 's during working hours you 'll get hold of the front desk after as you after hours call center and they mission a service request to the contractor to repeal the street lights it 's okay thank you anyone else ok these are suggested resolution there that its broad spectrum previous transfield the contract some remove the counselor planes hitting the bar council kruszewski all those in favor please say aye I against Kerry title number five extension of a contract for a road marking where if you drive and then you 're very good ok any other Christians of the back road marking well that 's just the journal one I think James Lewis would discuss this and before like if it 's a ceiling of a lot of the young round termino doing the lines particularly good way signs they 're only painting one line and they 're not when I made inquiries they said oh they come back and follow the other lines up I don 't believe that 's been done what sort of monitoring do you do on Road markers over concrete supervisor that before well the contract is doing the work is monitoring a sample of the week and then win a contract claim has forwarded full payment we 've also chased another sample to make sure that what they say they 're doing well and shake do thank you all right cancer John 's mr. Llosa just be quite interested in in your view I know one of the key drivers of the overall costs for council the general economy particularly in oil prices and bits and pieces that 's often why I get hammered home about how important the LGI is on the CGI bits and pieces but I guess the question I posed to you is the marketers move significantly in terms of some of those had costs than item five maybe more for item six should we not be looking to go out and test the market because the market conditions have changed I 'm thinking of taking staff costs aside for going through the tender process could we achieve some savings and this new market conditions these costs I throw that challenge there 's no girl things absolutely and it 's something that we certainly give consideration to be put before we put these items up to council bit of consideration and there is no guarantee in any market that you were going to get a better place and although I 'm cpol GCI one of those sorts of things cost the escalations and play effect and what it also plays an important factor and or something that we don 't have any control over is where the market is sitting at the time so what companies have got a food book and what the size of that is have much resources they 've got and whether they want to move into an area or evony or so those things up and play poor fella yeah I time to test the market rather than roll over contract could we save the right person money I don 't think you could save the right pair money I 'm certainly through the cost escalations that are built into the contract if there are negative cost escalations then they also apply yeah all right thank you Thank You councillor Jones hmm all right and you have a questions of dentistry garden road marking road runners and road marking can we ask random questions about roads any point in a random right in never ask a random question about right Jim would you like us to pause the webcam while you do that huh I just want to know when I can it 's all he wanted to know the location of speed cameras or want to ask about a specific question about the road congestion road just and what you know what we can discuss about brother ki ok we could diverse of it but just a quick you want I 'll lay are you a couple of minutes how 's that win yeah all right baby one doing here of the nice things bigger one okay we 'll get our thank you all right only I have a mover for item five road Brennus by kaspersky scene 2 by councillor pack always in favor please say aye aye since Gary _"

ascends the alarm that possibly the public process could under people 's participation and Lee giving up the funding I suppose yeah ok ok ok thanks to thank you for raising that Tina and we 'll just take a good counselor concerts years my commentaries I think it 's a great way and people connect and greater clarity around for allowing limousines so people present but would that have been a public meeting public mean three we haven 't decided anything yet we 're just we 're just I just want to get this clarified of T known we 'll just hear from some of the other counselors on this as Christians oh just a spanking spanking designed to I mean end of the day these distribution agencies I 'm just repeating ratepayers funnels on our behalf so I think I 'm consistency with our policy in the way you operate outside they should be in here too also you know we talked about policy and here that says that our activities must be transparent fear and fear and we need to be consistent you know I will support having those meetings both an open forum and allowing our applicants to present as well in terms of the effect of time all that 's involved with us and they will counselor the stewards just the word to their public meetings the people in the audience are not taking part they are just members of the audience and so I don 't really see that will be a lot time if I take what a house applications so i can 't see that there would be a dramatic increase in anybody 's commitment and i also think it 's beneficial for our communities to see democracy in action and it can earn about increase engagement with those distribution agencies with their services and it gives people an opportunity to single organizations are out there are asking for help i think around a computer

    "text": "okay item 5 reappointment of the district licensing committee approved members mr. Scott Devon boy good afternoon scope good afternoon I 'm not today save it for special occasions and so hope is the masculine not take the report is read just a quick summary the district licensing committee has been running the opportunities since the new alcoholic caimans place that 's been very effective functioning well and we are looking at reappointing the cheer in the committee for a further three years so the sale of alcoholic allows us to have that appointment for 5 years we decided to just try for the two years to start with if given effect it was a new Act and wanted to get a feel for health ins working before we took that next step so we were happy and comfortable with how that process is going and so the recommended resolution is to reappoint all those committee members for a further three years thank you Scott and so the actual some you know the process people applying all that sort things float pretty well as it every declined any this year one or two right so do any majority of areas are you like a simple decision that goes through just the chair it 's only ones that we have objections to the end up in a hearing process and it 's quite a small percentage it

Marie Claire water working with Marie on this licensing committee is an excellent commissioner for our area but is this really I think the best person we could get for the licensing committee created by writer Stephen Holden Sodor said I 've known was the clear water since he was about five years of age history goes back a while as council egglings indicated his knowledge is exceptional he 's very valuable when we come to a situation where we have to make a decision he knows the background absolute support their watch cancer kruszewski you think they 're fed and sample the products right hey

the I had a meeting last week with the y hora house just regarding the wire house issue CA B I know you 're probably go no however there is a special meeting coming up to discuss the proposed mean month and on this at the same time they 're also bringing up another amendment they want to change the operators society to a trust so I think that it 's with you further discussion maybe afterwards if we can do that yes as a group yeah the meetings on Friday I think we just need to discuss this a bit further because I think there are still some I 'm just um discussed issues who 's the best to come in darling so what is to discuss yeah oh kelsey jones said wirehouse wanted to change their i can so how do i mean sorry well i put this on the same that we had the their AGM and a proposed

charitable trust which I don 't know maybe that 's okay but we are running this would we hit are you on that all that 's what I 'm saying do a review yeah I don 't_''_511.17 so need some advice here don 't do we do we need to make a view on that or do we just leave the trust to run their own appears from my perspective I think we need to leave trust as it is to make their own decisions on what they want to do and how they want to govern themselves moving forward I mean we have our own policies in place where in Ford which we can review the deliveries as they come through that but I think it 's up to the trust to decide what format they want to deliver these services know I tend to agree that be and I don 't think probably advertised here no yes well I didn 't advertise the amendments as the as they were asked to be there right so this is what I 'm saying I don 't know okay well i encourage anyone let 's just be particularly interested to go along to winter there 's a meeting date

three days on the road and their beds and had their table out and we 're playing cards and hacky sack and going to the pub and drinking everyone 's left over beer out of the bottles on the outside tables and stuff he 's a classy people we have in the best Yemen suspect you know so Germany Germany wouldn 't do that I 'm so he 's always know so yeah I 've had to call the police in a couple times to move people along but there was a phone call to me today for concern ratepayer toper one guys aren 't doing your job i 'm hearing calls for you up here about the dock reserved about how they setting up tents but communal games now that doing communal games down on the reserve across the rope the dock one day on the lake frontier they 've actually got a whole problem is it why you sorry they 've got um yes it up communal tense now with a go and play cards and through the outdoor sporting events all going the greatest thing for me that murmurs tree poisoning this morning or tree poison tree cutting down the swine i got called to more chopper reserve which is why I was late someone cut down a tree on the reserve reviews two nights ago and the boys of the earth and council clearing it it 's really become a canary for us down there where people from out of town same thing as their right to chop trees down for a few ongoing problem i 'm sure i 'm not a tree hugger at all but i 'm finally a disgusting sort of act vandalism I 'll spoke to a couple of stuff to us about possibly posting a reward for information leading to an arrest for these people happy to do it myself but then I have a look with counselor cousin cousins offering ten grand reward for information but is there any ideas that council staff might have that we can try and control the situation because it 's horrible sin a 14 year old oak tree chopped off Scott 's not here at the motors prosecute them we offer 20 k is out we but we never catch them how do you prove it yeah and all the silver birches at the bottom of the arena so bottom of the hell up much of a had been poisoned drilled and poisoned in the last week I 'm not too sure how many seven or eight I think and it 's the same for you guys up here apparently the bun reserve here were you just all the trees have been just poisoned and chopped down international told me this morning I 've seen all the old accounts as I think pictures of the tree that they chopped down I just yeah it 's seconds me and for the point i don 't know if you heard about the lady who pulled up on a cat out opened a door a car came in a corridor off so she fact up in a car and left on a go cap on the side of the road she 's okay that yes yeah but like another good reason for trained at the home also agree that road 'm trying to sort remain on track here can somebody to gym so i just did a couple of issues when I raised a few months ago was in regards of the successful not success of the changes to the climbing wall at that stage was told we hadn 't gone through six months it was too early i 'm just wondering whether we could have an indication for the febri meeting exactly where we are in regards the fact that we kept it going for a number of years whether it is on track to break even ever been seen I 've also erased at a previous meeting when we had a gentleman walk in here and set up with Jake says I noticed that the ashburton district council had a lock down the other day as a practice no double to dramatize things but when we start having councils sticking something in place to lock down the facility are we a little bit behind the times mr. Fox might go to comment on it okay we 're do I think because of the time frame or diverting a things that were been on but but certainly I think because i 'm giving a bit of tolerance here because we 've got a bit of time on our side but if you have you have some queries about safety and security i think mr. Fox probably owe tax rate huge gigantic already done it alright um its foreign any other members reports hope it 's kind of just quietly comment on the concert which was great i know that some people prefer not to go but i just like to say that we did have the opportunity to chat was out of town ratepayers who kindly sat at our table who chef came up and sat down which was greatness in whose is this table and we said council good we rate payers will sit down which they did which was great and we did have a really really good chat and it was probably really worthwhile a lot of stuff was discussed about town and how they felt about it and it was really positive so just like to pass on that feedback thanks thanks can sorry castle well endorse counselor I was in councillor Polk just the feedback we 're getting from series ten ray players just to a positive sizings event and commentary better how things have been done better but wasn 't too many of those comments so your selfie on that period film it very very young couple from Hamilton 's here on the Palmerston and they come every year and meet up and it 's great insight which it 's based on a bit ahead what physical conversations Castle everything one of them include a rap area in boating preteen years it was your favorite artists Melissa I was outstanding event and you know well done too and actually the industry that 's created to right around the whole event whether it 's the food vendors that right you know the businesses that associated with that of India it 's quite a huge investment all right okay move a please for that members reports be received thank you cancer Stewart seconded by Councillor cousins who is in favor please say aye against carried okay it 's a into the public part of the anthem ever move a place for the reasons outlined maybe cancer pack sings about cancer a plane all those in favor please say aye against Kerry _"

    "text": "item number for a chief executive officer 's report mr. rooms thank you worship poem I 'd like to take the ultimate rods and however I shall I appointed a member of interest on more important issues the first one is the saving with the own delaney park floodlighting contract which we have mentioned previously but the meeting was held with Squire to ask if we did need to upgrade our lighting and it wasn 't the case and we don 't need to upgrade our lighting to meet any new standards for sky so that 's that 's a project which we can remove however there will be a paper presented to council at some point in the future hopefully sort of by around a parish there were will bring you wanting some maintenance requirements that we do have for those floodlights so that we can make sure that we 've got that covered off and secondly under service delivering performance just wanted to really highlight the fact that we are having some continued issues with our wastewater facilities around the consenting of the wastewater facilities we 're seeking and making sure that they are appropriate for the circumstances and I 'm sure Dennis will be at a answer any further questions if you have questions on that either now or or later on in the week and of particular note again I mentioned in our end-of-year function the at the AC baths event center complex where our building consents team are currently performing incredibly well in the face of a lot of development recently so I just wanted to really emphasize the fact that we 've had at standing results in that area and we are sort of right up there amongst the best at the moment I think it 's worth noting and then what happy to take questions and I just learned on faith I 'm followed by three we had an issue with our fireworks I think that 's been widely reported now I wouldn 't normally reported that at this meeting but we 've we 've already seen that reported some of them that happy to take questions okay thank you mr. lames any questions of mr. limbs thank you ganster krasovsky thank you met observation and our water usage and I noticed particularly in the area where i lived at them when we had that the week of rain there were a number of properties who had their sprinkler system going while it was raining quite heavily all day long and I wonder whether somehow rather we can up our education system or something rather to make sure that these people do not just use an automatic sprinkler system but their music as and when required very much so we we 're hoping to high height and our education campaign over the next couple months and certainly over the next 12 months before next summer i 'm personally hopeful that we can provide a lot more information directly through our website in terms of real time updates on water usage and possibly even linking that to our district meters so that we can highlight different areas within topol that would be using more water than the average around the district so there is a there is a strategy that will open to employ because wasteful use of waters is not really acceptable in a good so happy to actually take note of the properties that are doing this and actually send them a friendly letter just say look we know two sprinklers ago and there must be on some sort of automatic timing system we suggest that you that would certainly form part of an education campaign I think hey rich later would she not I 'm sure it wouldn 't be taken Thank You counsel Harvey can somebody I do have a number of the first ones on

council minutes of the ordinary council meeting the eighth from December 2015 and see any clarification or any members arising from those minutes Casa body turned on page 1 by 3 there 's the report in regards of the snowboarders I just want to raise an issue in regards of the agenda item on the eighth of December that items theta that during the initial workshop with councilman matter now this workshop was back in February I question about us having knowledge of the sculptures I 've been shown a diagram three diagrams with position shown on those diagrams and which I hadn 't seen before or those plans what it states here is there was signal intent some infrastructure such as conquer Earth 's if that 's the way you said have been installed during the construction period the response I got and when I asked for further information was they have not been installed yet as until we know the type in nature of the sculpture so I believe that that agenda item was slightly on misleading and the information i also have stated that the reason we had to make a decision in december the actual wording is the drawing did not include app lyft emma mutti tongariro street hints on engender in december we were to approve that location my question then is not only have they not been installed but if we 'd already agreed to as a council to have 3y was not one of those three positions looked at that information wasn 't supplies I just want to raise that issue of I believe that the minute the agenda item was not correct for the eighth of December Thank You Can somebody and you have a métis

number of interesting more important issues the first one is the saving with the own delaney park floodlighting contract with Squire to ask if we did need to upgrade our lighting and it wasn 't the case so we don 't need to upgrade our lighting to meet any new standards for sky so that 's that 's a project which we can remove however there will be a paper presented to council at some point in the future hopefully sort of by around a parish we 'll bring you will do some maintenance requirements that we do have for those floodlights so that we can make sure that we 've got that covered off

water working with Marie on this licensing committee is an excellent Commissioner for our area is this really I think the best person we could get the licensing committee created known was the clear water since he was about five years of age history goes back a while as counsel he cleans indicated his knowledge is exceptional he 's very valuable when we come to a situation where we have to make a decision he knows the background and absolute support there o.o.h cancer kruszewski you think they 're fitting but for the role counselor now I promise it all you get sample the products right all

proposed amendment and on that at the same time they 're also bringing up another amendment they want to change the corporators society to a trust so I think that it 's worthy of further discussion maybe yeah the meetings on Friday I think we just need to discuss this a bit further because I think there are still some I 'm just um discussed issues who 's the best to come in darling well what is to discuss yeah Oh Cal so John said why our house went into chains here I can 't_''_2256.989 so how do I mean sorry well I put this on the same they ask you the most of your at that meeting that we had the their AGM and a proposed amendment was made by the CA B and so they 've arranged for that meeting to be held but they 've also added another agenda item netzer and they want to change for an incorporated ciety to a charitable trust which I don 't know maybe that 's okay but we are running this would we hit are you on that or that 's what I 'm saying do you love you yeah I don 't_''_2297.519 so need some advice here don 't do we do we need to make a view on that or do we just leave the think we need to leave the trust as it is to make their own decisions on what they want to do and how they want to govern themselves moving forward I mean we have our own policies in place when Ford which we can review the deliveries as they come through that but I think it 's up to the trust to decide what format they want to deliver these services and whether it 's a trust or incorporated society they not I tend to agree that be and I don 't think perfectly and advertise do you know yes well I didn 't know but they didn 't advertise the amendments as the as there were asked to be there detective right so this is what I 'm saying I don 't know okay well i 'll include g1 let

kilometer speed limit on that over the next 2-3 weeks ok and in further investigations they 're not really sure why it 's happening that they 've they 've certainly done some remedial work on it twice

chestnuts the Lions company is root you 're not too sure if your web they 've released a consultation document that 's the new contract for customers it 's causing some who have a sudden end of the lake it 's particularly close 26 which relates to if you complain as a customer they have the right to terminate supply which I 've been um I just did to you for that I make sure you one of the people that have been asked to sit on the panel so I 've been working with community organizations and community groups to put together submissions mize is through what they 've asked me to do to put

it will all be collated in this is a draft terms new terms and conditions it 's replacing the 2009 terms and conditions and so it 's in draft form at the moment and so yeah I 'd encourage people to put their what 's the word for word okay thanks me so sick mom was a little topic of freedom camping as the sum of the year has been quite pronounced across the lake the most recent was some boys from Germany who parked up and on the road side road to honey and Kemp the three days on the road and their beds and had their table out and we 're playing cards and hacky sack and going to the pub and drinking everyone 's left over beer out of the bottles on the outside tables and stuff he 's a classy people we have in the best German suspect you know so Germany Germany would do everything is ready I 'm so he 's always nobody so yeah I 've had to call the police in a couple of times to move people along a concerned ratepayer topo 1 guys aren 't doing your job I 'm getting calls for you up here about the doc reserved about how they setting up tents for communal games now they 're doing communal games down on the reserve across the rope the doc one day on the lake frontier they 've actually got a whole bowl break as a la historia they 've got um yes it up communal tents now with a go and play cards he threw the outdoor sporting events and stuff I 'm concerned about how far that 's all going the greatest thing for me that murmurs tree poisoning this morning or tree poisoned tree cutting down the swine I got called to more chopper Brazil which is why I was late someone cut down a tree on the reserve reviews two nights ago and the boys of the earth and council clearing it it 's really becoming a canary for us down there where people from out of town same thing as their right to chop trees down for view ongoing problem i 'm sure i 'm not a tree sort of act vandalism I spoke to a couple of stuff about possibly posting a reward for information leading to an arrest for these people happy to do it myself but then I have a look with counselor cousin cousins offering 10 grand reward for information but is there any ideas that council staff might have that we can try and control the situation because it 's horrible sin a 14 year old oak tree chopped off Scott 's not here with Mona 's evil of them there 's compliance but certainly city and prosecute them we offer 20 k is out we but we never catch them how do you prove it yeah and all the silver birches at the bottom of the arena so bottom of the hell up multiple have been poisoned drilled and poisoned in the last

Ashmore told me this morning I the pictures of the tree that they chopped down I just yeah it 's seconds me and body point I don 't know if you heard about the lady who pulled up on a car opened a door a car came in a corridor off so she fact that on a car on leith on a guy cut because the side of the road she 's okay that yes you but like another good reason betrayed at the hair even also agree that road it is well I thank you Joe Scholz and system trying to sort remain on track here can somebody to gym so I just did a couple of issues when I raised a few months ago was in the guards of the successful not success of the changes to the climbing wall stage was told we hadn 't gone through six months it was too early i 'm just wondering whether we could have an indication for the febri meeting exactly where we are in regards the fact that we kept it going for a number of years whether it is on track to break even meeting when we had a gentleman walk in here and set up with Jake says I noticed that the ashburton district council had a lock down the other day as a practice no double to dramatize things but when we start having councils sticking something in place to lock down the facility are we a little bit behind the times mr. Fox might go to comment on it yeah okay well do I think because of the time frame or diverting a little but its members reports conferences seminars and fish development things that were being on but but certainly I think because i 'm giving a bit of tolerance here because we 've got a bit of time on our side but if you have you have some queries about safety and security i think mr. Fox probably okay this is a huge gigantic already done it all right um its foreign any other members reports nope it was kind of just quietly comment on the concert which was great i know that some people prefer not to go but i just like to say that we did have kindly sat at our table who came up and sat down which was great this in whose is this table and we says council good we 're ratepayers will sit down which they did which was great and we did have a really really good chat and it was probably really worthwhile a lot of stuff was discussed about town and how they felt about it and it was really positive so just like to pass on that feedback thanks thanks can sorry castle doctrine dorsal scores a clear title as well into us councillor using councillor Polk just the feedback we 're getting from series ten right players is to oppose the saws incident and commentary that how things have been done better but wasn 't too many of those come inside your selfie on that gravy on it very very young couple from Hamels here on the Palmerston yeah and they come every year and meet up then it 's great inside think it 's best tiny bit ahead what physical conversations of a castle it will be one of them include a wrapping it in boating sweet outstanding event and you know well done too and actually the industry that 's created right around the whole event whether it 's the food vendors that right you know the businesses that associated with that event now it 's quite a huge investment all right okay mover please for that members reports be received thank you cancer Stewart seconded by Councillor cousins who is in favor please say aye it 's against carried okay it 's a into the public part of the meeting there 's a resolution the apps for the confidential part of Michael ever move a place for the reasons outlined move because the pack and sings about cancer a plane all those in favor please say aye aye against Kerry _"

coming from the chairman of counting up a photo that contradictory muggle thoughts are having not heard about this no water before it 's not really a sport when we do in town at the school opportunity maybe to any I just think the whole thing has been handled it reasonably loosely is going to be costed accounted for the base that it puts on I really about it counselors to coming I know that I will see anything about skateboarder in the past three hours probably three I picked white as paper as user that you can make a decision and what you 've got here is a an organization 15 or Council which are proposing to gift a piece of two accountant in the poor there the design of the interception allows for increased just like most of our design work that we do would allow for something it in the future because X I need to sleep clinic that you see other pumpkins and if someone was good enough to get something we did actually we 've done our places that you would take the plastic example so new words that we do we try to accommodate them the monkey knows well talk to you so we try to find out future pieces that more people come along in this case you 've got an organization counseling to which is opposed to gift council a piece from a financial perspective it 's interesting to make that in this case it 's a hundred of the same gifted that are not going on the sculpture trust money to 5050 funding that you have I really there are we so it 's a hundred percent gift and the Steep bet five dollars in an email to the British of the week that we missed it was there because of their this unusual situation or being not after the 50-50 funding and a press release if he liked was was put on our website prior to this paper coming to counsel there 's some hands up and say but there was an oversight about this paper remedies that but nothing had been committed or know nothing of increased go at that stage as Jon says the pistol is even being instructed as I didn 't say it is still holding in your decision making yes it is that my hand up and apologize for the equally jumping the gun today please on the website but you do today is really my career seekers go well thank you becca i don 't care well i only support part of that the month agreed my liking but at least mr. egghead present those poor the natural gas period right about a huge street for us to look at I mean might be 'd like to move an amendment that we hold this resolution until we 've seen a draft or whatever of this particular subject because as I said before volcom is no board to me it 's better to directly or a community it 's not a sport that we practice and kappa this is my thoughts are putting behind one that 's a stroke so they just totally looking at the tourism parts of what 's happening around our district taco is a place where people come to stay to go to the mountain because we need to lure them to stay in to any instead of Delphi and to any instead of Fox papa so it is actually a destination for four people that come here to go so we want an end skiing because we 're dis be trying to get them not to what you said to me I presume is to relieve the proposed there 's sometimes a lot yep around ones you just want to cycle yeah gosh i have an apology accepted Gareth I think it 's a fine offer from from challenging to with their rear bikes they were putting something up on the intersection today beautifully whatever it was as we drove past if you 're a wonderful organization I 've never intersect it with gratitude and I leave the resolution and I 'm quite happy to see in the reservation because in total we also have all the skin we have a wakeboarding perfect sector and I think that it 's a piece of Attica brie interpretive 22 and represent those sports as well some your particular can I just ask a question before we go to John this you and mr. read the I 'm snowboarder is that going to be permanent installation or not present sensation okay I mean I only i only post the thought that we have quite a demand we get off spend a lot of requests to put pieces of arts through the town and we 've already got single pieces and these things so is this the best spot on another piece that 's exactly in a series such pull today cuz when they want to do I would like to hold a spot their prices because we need to make sure that we 're looking at the whole picture of different offerings and put across to catch up cancer leave some intuitive so I was endorsed counselor parties going together 2013 boys looking for things kept times will you speak to them these sculptures city what everybody was doing them again and with regard to head with is what somebody wrote eventually and just on to their medical genius every game so example so notice if I do was go pressure parents Prince not and then again increases saw an ego why did so they can get some epic film I 'm just a query on the side plan come and try to keep like 05 on a particular corn is there actually not room for the sculptures so thus culturally sculpture is constrained by the sights of you belt if you approve it it would be like aside you can stop and don 't get sick services so sort of customized to be open his own body wants to you can say the minute resolution capsule Williamson 's comics it 's not was the fact that was something on Regina paper that we knew nothing about it 's very similar to doing up of the center of town where effect counselor you know we meet with Andrew in frazer removal of those trees and I 'd sure that is not part even though I have anybody that says and the press release Island you get to work by treating Jesus I grew up in your chamber what about the decision that it retains the crucial choir the tree right here so you will repay you in Timaru heavy trees on the corner that was only one is to missing the hour tongariro strip we 're taking the Senators cancer opening myself that a treat would be parked back on each time that 's a bit like is this man says know some people in tikka '_''_589.829 but i will move amendment that we wait for this position till we 've seen a drive or actually thought if you i pod that sculpture and i 'm fully behind a fancy they 're doing a kick-ass what is his castle are you ever sitting methylation me but I just to see them can supposed to do support and doesn 't appear so so we 'll go back to the resolution that was moved by cancer having you signify capsule back any other discussion all those in favor please say aye it 's against them _"

    "text": "item number five Oprah district traffic controls update review amend yeah about the name clear her afternoon of every this item as well should really be going through the freed committee but we need to look at installing some markings prior to februari when the next scheduled meeting for freed committee is scheduled so what we 've got us about 6 meters of no stopping on lower place which is to basically provide access for the contractors for the pump station on long place in the second runner is to put in a new mobility space on tongariro streets as part of the Tama mu2 tongariro upgrade project thank you so they need to be done pretty quickly then obviously like well we 'd like the mobility space to be done as part of the demo to upgrade project I 'm in the low price prior to summer so the mobility space takes up the place of an existing car pack or yeah yes this is on the tongariro street not Tim moody street it 's on the corner of chonburi I straight up just outside the lake surgery right for the chair and I agree with the we were gone she put the agree with recommended resolution once again I go back to councillor bodies concerns about no timings are an issue but free committee agenda items are getting burned out council pushed open house suppose I do have a concern about that too much is coming back to full council with you know this one 's body all that time is and as the others have been back and asked if we have a more considered effort to bring it to the right committee so like to say thank you can scuzz ins any other comments out cancer process key what an happy to move items as well but just before I do can you please tell me what the overall number of car packs of the losses of overall number of car packs will be with the sale of the 240 total car pack + T the street up upgrade on have a muta street and now the car park outside the doctor 's surgery term emotive street I think there was for that we removed and outside the new development on repay hood street the old the older so what yes if in see them try and try and create some numbers here I think we 'll report back to obey now as to what there 's no desire because there 's been a lot of wind and parking created at the same time as we 've lost packs so I think we should just do an exercise my know the numbers are kicking around single and I because there 's quite an epic or subjective it is nothing we just put a spreadsheet of information together yeah hope you I was that look at I really Rick know when we get asked yep guess hobby just regarding Lowell place that 's pretty tight for parking now on the scene of the cafe and things like that is it necessary to have such a large area yellow lines I agree do we do we need to sort of like it so you 're slow so pluggable parking down there now is very at those straight of end now without a job cleaning right the other issue it 's just quite narrow and the difficulties any access any of the direction is impossible it 's really getting the the truck son for the pump station so if somebody 's parked on the other side it just blocks up the whole Road and then actually is a major in quite critical pump station so if something happens we need to get to it immediately yeah it 's been nearly on the pump station has risked the café 's only recently the word on for that the cafe the resource consent of the tape they actually states that they can 't provide parking on the on the road so they have to avoid additional car parking you 'll notice that 's why they 've got little sandwich board sign never sighs give you part on the road please don 't please park in the hotel and car park so that 's a specific requirement of wheelchair phone so you 're not yellow lines you never just someone so does it yeah it does just through the chair I 'd just like to add to Rosie 's consume and because for that tenant cabbage but yet the visitor parking is very limited as it is so yeah I 'd worried the six meters it slow quite that much sure that you six meters this not a card and looking to park it 's usually a lot truck that is probably near or a few meters and it is necessary to provide protect their parking if there 's a failure in the pump station you need to get attract there with a small crane or something and time is of the essence that pump station if it overflows is going to go straight into the lake right when I need to make earrings for did suddenly it is a very difficult location that one and the you know the cafe tis very well amor from there and absorbed by a lot of people who have good banker failures but the infrastructure really does have to come first in that location ok thank you very much it 's been moved by cancer Chris tusky I believe correct seeing the blood cancer jolons will those in favor please say aye it 's against clearer for i required some information to do with car parking under than every minute so you hit that a place that exactly I don 't there item number sex swimming pool building pulls Amendment Act came good afternoon game after Lee so do we need to slow things pose oh this is purples and take the recordings red and any questions yep it 's pretty much all poems it so it 's just a moment 's to the pool fence and pulls out we 've had problems with it since the fence and project was created this is a further amendment to that which we 've written submission totem to indicate our particular feelings either way and we require you to ask for that 's for your endorsement of that submission okay they gave you any questions Jane night pretty straight forward well I suggested their resolution on six by one that I have a movie for that please no cancer faxing the broadcaster Stewart rule isn 't privately say I it 's against carried item number seven redundant policies after Emily hey what the runes got a copy much to airdrie a little bit just to highlight a gift that um this has sort of being driven from a couple of different directions I guess International llevo yard is the Rose reduction task force in place and also from a regional level these the mural extreme which is kind of will be pushing us I guess in a direction just to make sure that we 've got a nice untidy and consistent level of policy so that 's what 's driven this item like containing silver unique kitchens a very pretty straightforward cancer-associated have one basically it is that under the economic development action plan I understand what you 're saying there but then we have rob 's economic framework thing and we have wills Department of Business Development and whatnot how how we deal or cope or whatever do with that once we delete this action plan well I guess that 's sort of part of the reason we are deleting it because at the moment we have all proposing to delete it we have a couple of different pieces which drive economic development and this one and interfaced great lake taupo has put on your own strategy so taking this one away just make sure that we 've got consistent from that point of view and also with you know there 's a work that 's been doing internally as well so does that mean we need to replace that with a new one and in order to take care of Rob development and framework and thing and probably not would be my advice so and the way in which we manage enterprise-grade Lake Tahoe is through a contract for service so you know unless I come in report you know you can define what you really like them though so that 's who over there are two in terms of the report that rod does if you want if you want to adopt it that 's up to you but you know this this current report i think was written in 2009 so you know it 's actually here today thank you right thank you any other questions cancer Germans just a point of clarification thanks Hilary in terms of the reasons for revoking some no longer relevant I guess and for some of them they have been in place or so long that they just simply are out of data in there no longer relevant to what we 're doing but also some of them have had other policies which have come in and that are not directly do it with plaque replacements but for example we hit the arts and culture policy and it 's which has got quite general policies in it which nearly twenty fifty covers a lot of it I 'm so in that case it 's no longer relevant because these other things would a twitch of superseded up just one last question from the library yes it 's probably something that we just need to do a little bit more work on but we just thought we might as well take it off the list now because this one is so out of date that it 's yet so back then it probably does need to be a little bit more discussion about whether we need to replace that and going forward and there 's no risks at thorough review process and made sure that and we we need things in place they have been they are in place already problem okay these thanks Rosie and that 's a German did me ok so I 'm I was just want to talk about the steel extinction policy and so saying here it 's not going to be a pet policy of the internal operating procedure yeah so here 's counselors how if it becomes internal operating procedure can it potentially disappear all say doesn 't mean that it stays there and we are aware of it if it goes into nor does it make it altered well we 've got a the policy team managers register with our policies so whether they are a council policy which is available to the public or we 're alone and into new operating procedure that on that list so we manage their end and dennis is a gym do is it you sure that you the person really suits out how you determine what roads are going to be seared rather than selling those themselves you do to ensure they enter CL extinction the policy actually is the operating frame rate this is will once we determine how much money you 've got which roads have priority so that 's why the curse is trying to color yes yep okay so that operating policy which that would still function and providing those funding set aside for seal extinction so case you still like to push for my railroad or whatever we say with no guarantees tomorrow yes the shrimp yes let 's go what the matrix will still reach juice then the rankings receivers are you started yes is that the last comment on it sees keep it the amount available has changed not the priority system only shinobi pasa yeah I 'm not sure if she 's sure so I 'm gonna just added that on the important current is that the process still needs to be returned that it 's not actually a true policy it 's moving operational exercise so the important thing for electrical business that you do see the rankings between the worlds and can justify rather large get stunt yeah yep before you do I 's fluoride where you got 1080 which is a controversial subject let 's get over it if the people choose what they want see in the lake in the water have it as a policy that we 're going to remove I think we 've already signaled that we 're going to discuss that the long term plan my point is we can do it now mr. get off you and get it done i think i 'll probably be saver to go back to Castle huh clangs removing with a resolution in silver bug can stir back and at this stage but appreciate where you 're coming from John but I 'm quite prepared to lead the charge is good boy okay so it 's been moved in second but all those in favor please say aye against k carried and and chancel bodies prepared to hold a public meeting on fluoride I didn 't say there see they can ring mean are we fear them to you well they sell a good to see you _"

    "text": "autumn number 8 of sub delegations Obama I thinking worship yes this is a procedural answer but it 's also important for you to understand where I 'm heading in this particular issue about two and a half years ago I think I approached counsel at the time to provide delegations to me tremendous stuff like that Amanda must report and at that time the council rope to feel comfortable with will the program and I think that that was on the basis of not really long and brown and rule particularly well because at that point in time they hadn 't really been exposed to the chamber over that time I think they 're involved and their fair share that with in the Chairman will hopefully have developed a bit of confidence really like to oneness that they are capable senior managers within the organization from the philosophical perspective our don 't operate without deputing a pasar operate with the ten of our senior managers that at any particular time if the worst case were to care that they were capable enshrined into tacular of the activities other chief particularly for progression and for job enhancement and job satisfaction I 've I would like to tell the opportunity to advance my management to about providing that ability to to give that experience and to all of my for most senior managers with the organization so that 's the philosophy behind the reporter farmers to flow over tomorrow or work away I believe that you will have a capable while trying to fill people to be able to then turn to rather than just limit the MIT where the experience lies so just for a example of you have your going away you will appoint one another there 's only one city manager that automatically as of right has the delegation to act formal and that is Allanon ciose although if i was to appoint any of the other three managers to that well whilst i was arrived for a period of time days or perhaps a week or two I believe a non-elected window sort let you know what 's happening again and what the duration would be ok alright any questions or queries of mr. Williams I can here and alan is not here you won 't have a third one and a fourth one to pick up their role no I see it more important than the fact that we remember sort of quite a quite a nurturing and supportive management tool and so it 's highly right managers would be here else I wasn 't here but I will be able to identify one or one of the one of the fill to be able to take the loans for that particular time but they would be there which supported by the rest of the team that was here I don 't anticipate a time where we would have three managers a while on my cell phone at the same time what were born unusual experience time limits wrapped around those in terms of time limits from a pragmatic perspective and have said number weeks leave per year and so I wouldn 't expect them to be actin for the whole generation of my time away i will expect them to be acting proportions of that time away no it 's not what you say so and career progression because again i wouldn 't expect my management turned to be here for a period of 20 years to be able to give a good staff a very capable staff the ability to move on the cruise this sort of delegation gives them exposure to experience that can then enhance the opportunity for future progression you can ask the question organization like ours as in size alex bennett etc etc what 's the norm Depot would so we are one of the leanest management team sort rather have seen structures that have six or seven majors well I mean the number that face do I hate the place of the CEO of either way that with very dependable chief executive I websites but it 's not unusual to win an organization in this way some local theaters i would i would have to guess what 's so hard work half of the local authorities had eliminated deputy but again philosophically I don 't_''_274.099 I don 't like to operate without mobile a tube deputy I think that puts two eggs in one basket when we have a a couple of am questions thank you for Rob what process will you go through to decide which officer you will delegate to is there every set of process that you 'll go through to share this attack each case on its merits be again one of the main considerations they don 't have the issues that on the board at the time but I 'm going to be alone and again I would also look at who is around who can provide support because the last last thing I wanna do is review does unsupported is round so we need to make sure that we 've got the right team on the bird and the right person making the kouzef well if we 're in that situation fighting the factors would be what was coming up on the horizon that you knew of and what support was around for those little clouded by other little particular time and we always get notified when you 've delegated that authority thank you okay cancer can move move by cancer kruszewski seeking to buy cancer strip just did what meeting is I CEO does been writing put it to the council who is taking over in his absence yep it really exists a resolution but it exists for the last term so this would have just add to that resolution will be more understanding I 'm Nick the Drupal this resolution requires me to notify you if it 's not island that is going to take over and the reason the resolutions written that way is because I could fall over we want a link and you will to really have that delegation in place so you can rub that delegation if you wish but it already exists in the previous delegation from two years ago so I cannot delegate together for example without emailing you yep Jim that 's that 's why find the resolution is quite interesting because Rob if you didn 't follow that you couldn 't do what you 're required to here let 's put it in writing the new chief executive would come over to him president ever have a new structure so we only get nine yourself you got to take a delegated authority to have to move our findings to me so he knows least I 'm sure what i think is canceled we 've never canceled bird sing goodbye cancer stroke sorry okay and yeah i think you know it 's a good resolution this recognize some these causes some up-and-coming very respected staff members so good luck to them all those in favor say aye against Kerry item number mine tina tina arena adoption of meeting schedule 2016 i made in general is it missing you generate fish one scheduled for the second of every i would try to follow a similar format to this to this last year however you 'll notice that the freed and audit and risk meetings are now on a monday rubber boom ba the tuesday just in terms of trying to try to put the meetings on ok he to answer any many Christians chairman we fought with mrs. jokes when finally achieved that we meet on the fourth tues of the month which is brilliant and I 'm changing it just to see whether because they 're here chooses the last and they were not monday in fourth monday so maybe they could be added thank you i sees no meetings in october other no there 's nothing nothing will be young google divided after october oh yes anyone thought so add the commentary to read or happy or that i came with that being the case moved by Councillor John and seconded by Councillor part all those in favor say aye against Kerry title number team council engagements one further meeting to add on the seventh emergency management meeting I think that 's one o 'clock start 142 on what dates out on the 7th Monday the civil suit and each departed through the chip at two of the recommended resolution was about retrospective approval given to a free workshop and Russia and I actually didn 't attend my teeth my twins setting an exam and the intermediate that day so I stayed and support them instead so all I mean that nothing else we need okay they king could I have a movie please thank as cousins seconded by Councillor Jones I mean to well as emphatically so I again carried item number verbal reports on I mentioned just just wants to chip in regards of the outlast access meeting we 've had a few complaints and regards of both the gum gum trees down by can 't_''_645.61 be on the axis across the street etc now no they 're supposed to be protected trees that 's becoming a bit of a standing joke but also the trees I noticed when I Stan was robbed on the waterfront the guns alongside our brand new path it 's an absolute mess now Perry those gum trees were planted by the wound near one so they 're not be removed and something in you and the Taranaki hundred town those countries are particularly on that corner and causing a whole lot of problems we 've got a rest staff we 've been list as well as little irritating in terms of trees that we were probably right to take out so you know them habitable is to the food committee to discuss if that helps you up on the corner mmm look I 'm just going to send exes wheelchairs well you can 't get not notable trees though sorry will only bring item to do with non notable downloader increase or summary we need to address that issue through the district and you might bring a memorable to the sick it 's a district unchanged distribution resource consent well what can I then asked if it 's a notable tree and you get those high winds and all those facts they call them what runners or something 's make into a car or the trees tip over into the marketplace or whatever who 's liable trees we can trim the trees if they act was in a danger but in a normal course of events and that 'll take an all around the country witness has happened is there nobody 's liable it 's a it 's an act of God and that 's been tested through the course repeatedly in the country we 're not in fact I 'd say taupe was probably one of the council 's that has least issues Lucia to the trees compared to most others because the new planet before here and you you know you from up with it so the free road trees aren 't noticeable notable are they and noticeable but they 're not notable here are some notable people those in the corner really fun I very much more boat harbor be on the corner as notable and there 's a couple deer that I no one 's in the corner without street in the moon 's notable so the processes have redeemed these trees to be dangerous universally been there to the food committee alright know that if they if you 're concerned about a particular tree and then let us know we 'll be there uh Burris to go have a look at them if they are dangerous from a science perspective then there 's process we still need a resource consent but there 's a process we can go through to get a consent to remove those particular trees on the corner there and they aren 't considered dangerous they have been looked at quite regularly on an annual basis and as part of our risk management if your life is that we continually monitor visa because it does change you you report will these through to the next food committee rooms and just even if it 's a report to say what the status of these trousers I think it 'll be helpful starting point yeah come on I 'll see the roots and just redo the road Jonathan Guardian baduk couple hours yeah bags can select a zone through the chair I just want to say thank you to a Catholic counselors made me John Williamson who isn 't here today and also to John body for always coming to our meetings and to Danny and taking a really proactive part out discussions not exactly what is going on down there I just re appreciated by our community so I just wanted to thank John it 's gone well that and just finally tipped announced my intention to run for the open neural tube if we have it Eddie it is throw my hat in the ring I will miss you here well thank you very much and just like my homecoming that 's everything I I 've managed I think Zane same class each of these however your 've managed to get the item of the body point swimming on the next agenda on monday at Hamilton Wow by round base I don 't let it make any difference so it 's on this is those pretty points for me situation so cancer how he could go down with your string bikini yeah to die weiße after on the water wheel on the water thank you TCB have just known someone guarantor one of the opportunity said it to consume what about so i get to the point they we don 't make it to what we wish for definitely people what will your school year that we go and what you throw that but i 'm sure well hopefully if there 's a metal area just a bit both we could get some signage to say yeah follow ear sort of thing that 's what 's always think not good at some of the TT it some traction the cycleway yes it could be a to be an opportunity to fix the deity yeah but well done thank you thank you guys for your work and your the district but against carried

    "text": "okay we are to remember fear they are thinking leadership and the chief executives report is your phone detailed and quite extensive rather than through of the art anticipating time I just want to highlight a couple of issues that I think are important just to mention the first one is the reference on fubar 12 the underlayment Park federating scheme room going to have a meeting with Sky TV I just want to report back the bear mountain with Sky TV has happened and Sky TV have recommended that we shouldn 't spend a dollar on the night end because they can broadcast perfectly capable with the lighting that we have so there 's a potential significant savings in a budget for that but of course you simple issue is not being completed but you 'll know that it 's a very good reason for it to not be completed their own pace that will actually sort of have fun in that project and make sure that we did actually do and a lot of background reoccurrence we could have spent a lot of money for a very little in the financial are titled at some for bar too I just want to confirm that that bolaven to spend is primary in relation to waste water infrastructure where we are still working with the Regional Council to negotiate resource consent conditions that will be the foreign oil community there we will continue to pursue that on we 're on your behalf because again we don 't want to waste million things that we see particularly consenting environment than our other than reasonable I worse or not particularly achievable so you will continue to see those projects be delayed until we can be a resource consent that we believe is adequate and appropriate for this this community and for me I just wanted to alert you to the fact that on page four bathroom and we 've had it mentioned in rid of this man and that our bill english is certainly driving the process of refreshing be very very legislation together with a little bits and pieces of legislation those are huge risk in there for this council as most councils in terms of that legislative process because as to happen very quickly it tends to have significant change embedded that we have to find out about it short notice so as staff will be keeping a very close eye on matin in familiar than the developments but i also recommend the selected members if you get the opportunities to attend those things or meetings about this particular topic work so that you do because your information from whatever source will be very welcome in this chambers will progress food and the net or take the rest of the reporters read and we 've never stood up the staff in the room for questions as well baby thank you thank you mr. Williams any questions or queries up miss Williams Casali I 'm on page four bar three where it mentions vacant lenso 2015 those figures are not right okay this I 'm not sure where you got them from that taupo can lock and so on adding up to 73 am i doing my numbers right there pretty much double that all right you must here today you might find that on these out to katie jenn from sorry maybe well for the year today yeah but that probably a month either it 's not that matter of fact we will see this rules from a value and you 're right they are that they are out of date yeah and they should know where the cells at the moment that well out of date so what were these work run for deadly up to um i think it might be something like august and bring a more that 's just opal and can lock it one include the destruction I 've got 33 sales record at the total district from the decrease of April to now women that have started for my treatment month pretty sure it 's a calendar year so I think from january through to august i think yeah i did a bit of a ricky yesterday and it was about a hundred and thirty sales i thought so that 's a really good so I 'm so first idea thank you because it 's important to do what the figures rot the purpose of the table and the information immediately prior to it that tape who 's actually going through a pretty good the moment we need to celebrate that we also need to ensure that we don 't sort of get ourselves out of ourselves our that 's will remain a true last year whereas it shows less than last year and definitely not least the last year you right okay yep oh sorry cancer pack must you think you just don 't feel bad too am under imagine that his arrest it talks about the work being done on the council 's risk statement I just wondered and what the time frame was for that paper to be presented to council so you mr. chair probably to the next audit risk committee meeting there 's initial starter I think this council Jones thank you we 're sure I 'm just through the chair Rob just a point of clarification on for bar three just in regard to the Easter trading hours in the bill that 's before Parliament it says in your report here that they 'll be asking for submissions by the 21st January just to clarify if we need by that date or is that when submissions calls for submissions I 'm just conscious of Christmas yo Nick would you have an answer for that possible we 're working with lg 's into on formulating position on they 're also talking to park we stand up our north you 've got high here and pleased to have similar exemptions to ourselves the position we 're just working on is whether we push forward to maintain the current exemption or whether we 're fall in line with other parties like rotary pushing for a stained glass so what we 'll do once we 've drafted up circulated by in there at least we can give if you went up in a group setting and just make sure that you 're comfortable with me here because it would be good to make sure we 're all there are any potential changes that we will at that table otherwise we might be on the dinner menu just one more through the Chi while I 'm on my train of thought I 'm just an update if I came from mr. Samuels please wire RK technical institute in the back plenty politic no I have anarchy Bobby hemmitt too I don 't wanna keep my Ricky why do we expect that report was snogging bored so I know when their submission close though it was going to go straight to the minister thought it 'd be really on the minister 's home home so yeah and it was Custer Johnson you thinking everybody on for by 21 we 're talking about the gardens of significance it stated that the South the main gardens are due to be a seasick timber October is said that last month have they been done things actually November I don 't know whether that figures wrong it 's coming up before Christmas but something he does it do you looked over yeah you have sorry there 's a mistake on that on that it 's actually local doin what does the assessment of them yeah this yeah well it 's good for them but he 's want an apology email you my next question oh sorry no you were my name is maybe will be to mr. Lewis in other ways like that was 10 and then if we go down mix one down to surge out a fold-out cause it 's his 38 through to october and yet last month it said it was on track so they send a piece of quite large all that 's over short period 38 and collapse of all sort of things not just those and that 's for the four months to october and the target is listen eight and we currently at 2.11 a row with another target I think was just the fact that last month and I 'll kick it up up is about last month 's agenda here that there was zero I said that we 're wrong trait so that may be the number that you say we measure on you know I 've need to cheat last month and Seaver I didn 't think it was zero last month and I know on track this was looking yes then we are on trade against the coaster ski and just going back through four by one and four back two years regards to life as the weekend is there any update he was here John was he during open daily really well we have that at the bridge room watch we had a number of councillors I wouldn 't really really helped having elected me in 20 messages interaction with the community we reckon we had somewhere in the region of about thirty odd people turn up a lot of those stay for the duration which was really good everyone was pretty happy with the way things went we had I was guessing our Papa said about eighty eighty-five percent of the questions are actually more to do with Waikato regional councils operations questions around gravel extraction maintenance stop banks questions around writing project initiated the zone so we ended up doing quite a lot of shuffling around and you 're working with the WRC star who came along for the day as well that some I imagine went very well very little negative effect in terms of the purposes today from our perspective there was a good opportunity to talk to a number of people about these specific properties and it 's great having very specifically about their issues so I went very well and we 'll just carry on with Vidya the process we 're expecting thanks to probably drop off a little bit now in terms of his awards Christmas but then again early in New Year may well thank you I think since I did it was really good John and John and myself who are on the committee were there and the staff did a really really good job of having all that information at their fingertips in having and the Regional Council guys there was you needed them because and staff who saw what would happen and they did a really good job and it was a really good interaction oh yeah thank you have cancer pie it 's they cute and physically I just like to congratulate you in common in the civil defense team in Lisa and the comms team for the wonderful they did to add summation national shakeout event where I 'm topo district head over 5,000 participants and I thought it worked really well with the Georges Bank here at Council for that and is about a limited notified hearing in december for why keep golfers golf resort I 'm just wondering for clarity is that why he resort itself um I don 't believe we have a why he golf resort I just doesn 't make sense through a cheer that 's the International Golf Course wacky coffin century yeah and there is a hearing later this month or beginning of next month between contact and themselves as far as some agreement on drilling that they are hopeful that they can come to an agreement and the total construction can 't convince yeah I just for clarity and that 's quite confusing and it 's why he golf and safety is the actual name of the properties so perhaps if we could just a minute because I would imagine that kept the guy may may be that they who wonder what 's going on okay casa cousins here back to the amisha non-cellular Stewart was talking about whether the capital of crumbly people is our connect those in the thank you Nick for following up really swiftly I think Karis got a letter out for mr. megassa time frames it 's one thing i want to talk about or ask about was it 's not a she and this but we had a remove was the townsend upgrades to linear that story boards have a commutable members came from yesterday want to know where we are at with those they 've all been a greasy but knowing up yet yo just we just got the which call them the draft stuff from the graphic designs up the road here so i think there 's a couple of tweaks in there but our intention is to have milk for christmas cool ok you can circle Chesky is that just for my benefit on all bar nine democracy and planning and they 've prepared a James JM a with 25 cover different sort of an agreement that were talking about then I 'm he says so so this is what sorry provided for in the river religious latian and inside that that workers from it thank you what okay thank you they can sponsor Nikki just come more Oh mom can somebody i unban for Information request we used to get those in our Friday email or wonder whether that could resume just feel it down the page on 427 at marks I just want to carefully this will do include agreements with kosis will tour dates you know I get the resource management applications hood it 's a while since I 've seen an official information videos only students it shouldn 't have dropped off but it will double check on that bit but every four if that 's the case we should just put official information everywhere nice new look further down the page these seven items in regards of economic development where it states that the first quarter 4 15 16 will be available in December CEO to update last month assume it would be available this month is there some delay and getting an information out yes it 's just um the market view or economic data and there is a delay so yeah it 's why we put it on that would be december authority just like oh I just went flying a boy was achieving also on four bar million which is good news did anyone read the full report you said four report what effect the full report actually states that the total amount spent in our area was 128 million however there was an outflow of 39.4 2 million which gave a net inflow into the area of 88 million now the reason I raise it it 's good news but is it a little bit misleading to say there was 128 million dollars and what brings it more closer to home and this is I think where we got the impact of our overseas visitors if we go to the cardholder air card holder area taupo the valley spent with 67 point 0 1 million that is a one percent increase on the court at same quarter last year where you go to the other documents and it talks about what the overseas spin was that 's where you see the 67 million spin spinning locally non-local spin out in the area with 61 so that really shows the impact of the trade we 're now getting through foreigners to happen all right cancer javi page 's a number of five hundred dollar infringements being issued do they get followed up and do these people pay these fines and can anything more Bend up be done can their fines be increase I mean these people are obviously been continually thin delayed the answer accessories so this defines the issue you say I followed up and if necessary we take them to court no the same they won 't be the same the same person so it 's a thing that happens on a regular basis and the employment or fine will be an instant infringement of this not paid and it goes to t2 the district 's difficulty process they keep doing in hidden but alright sit an address on lake terrace their night that 's good okay um couple questions on the report certainly yes if you fall back everybody here full bar 35 to do with the lake terrace pathway you know as a result of flank from the excess committee we meet with the CEO mr. Bowden Andrew on site I 'm just current me the exact date I 'm wondering what the 've read what have you done but when we beckoned to weird can because I wasn 't_''_1110.799 at the July meeting I see that the the document here for 35 says the contract was full of fulton hogan fulton hogan and yet effect it was by our website at gender etc it was given to TR construction are there one on the same i think what was a sub traitor for the other so that 's the that 's the problem or illusions that we 've had sub contractors working away the program making we gave a contract to a certain company and the concrete work seems to be subcontracted out and quite frankly the piece we looked at rob was a be miss for sure what are we going to do about that and I understand that that 's going to be repaired to Arkansas these I don 't quite know where to our constructions come from because the AIDS Halloween ya ali well it 's not to hollywood 's name on the vision we on it again the document head because i read it here this morning we exist i guess the thing for us is the responsible contractor is the one that we that we 've approved the contrary to that 's the principal contractor and those who are legal relationship is that is from a quality control aspect of this and we go back to ensure that their quality and that the contract has been achieved its normal practice that on most jobs there will be subbies led the principal contractor hits mainly because they don 't have the skills or expertise to do certain parts so we take a AC bars as an example there was a company who Watson who 's got the contract but they had roofers l trish ins instance of subbies which were contracted with lots of use rather than directly work now since the normal pregnancies yeah just to go in and completely goes to the actual question which is what have you done about it we actually met with actually pull not the mobility access code or members of that Nabila access group under committed to install mcafee will drop crossings for access under the path and which has I saw the subcontractor that was also cultural meeting to discuss the workmanship issues and they have been reserved our world from that port that the water was hurt so we as a council did have a project manager on site to deal with those developing technology that is involved with the project is that unsightly and episode of the time but I 've certainly poldo visits to the site the two sites were now they 're definitely out allowing down for excess for mobility people as they have to go through the Council for approval through our normal parking and or is it just that it so it 's it 's part of the project and it was a very location that particularly recommended so that was just to door yep great okay so all right so just to die resolution leon full bath for information be received I have a move Thank You cancer treatment so going to buy cancer kruszewski all those in favor please say aye against Kerry _"

please say aye against and carried an item number two receipt at the minute Sierra converse committee the third committee and the topo arising from those minutes so straightforward to me okay equations or queries we 've canceled hurtling seconded by Councillor cousins or those in favor say aye I 'd against carried item number three summer recreational licenses hello good afternoon mother abbess lee this would normally go to our food committee about due to the timing of applications of the meetings it needs to come to council today and so we 've had two applications when and which council have granted in the past two previous summers and the hive jet skis at tomar Bay reserve in a new application for walk and water balls and we did we were going to have daniel sutherland from the jet ski hire to talk to council today that he 's unable to attend and that there is a letter received from her maid attachment sex i think it has to your agenda and it will do have a deep handle from the walk on water ball and application here Shey so she cannot see any questions you may have for her application thank you then afternoon no debt Helen good nice to see got a couple of things to highlight and all right go through the report too much detail and just for sale on the jet ski hire a medication as you will have seen ocean report we 've had signage complaints that shows the press previous two summers and and so the recommendation is to decline the application this summer and I 've also had a discussion with maritime New Zealand to assure the amusement device certification for and the hive jet skis and the operator Daniel southern hasn 't complied with the condition of getting a remote radio device and in their vices being that when his next amusement device certificate comes up for renewal at the end of next year and they won 't reissue it and this if they see evidence of him pitch saying that device so that justification so the card operator they don 't have that device it 's a condition of this certificate right they 've been lenient with them so far is they 're going to make a hash approach and when his license comes up for an eel next time okay 2016 wish to highlight what thanks thanks Sarah pecially should we deal with the walk on water Paul 's first which gym just for you do I have a couple of issues with what we 're dealing with them Riley didn 't say that it 's a Fred decision and the subject has been brought up it to the degree that would not have another meeting or we can 't have it if you look at the agenda items that starts off a freed me tnx he says when required there are no set dates and a little bit concerned that the one to do with the the jet ski if i look at the gentleman 's our letter three bar 25 he talks a meat of a meeting its was way back in the city for the first fifteen 86 number of months ago why hasn 't this been brought before the freed committee meeting before and if I can speak to that it 's being it would have come to the food committee meeting and that we didn 't receive and Daniel sub loans application for a nervous license unfortunately so you would have deemed it as an operational thing up till the inner space yeah he only had the upper but he only operated over the summer months and so his license expired inning we 've only just received an application does that answer your question no could further clarification if they appeared to be some difficulties in this license been and renewed why we advised way back when the problem started to arrive so we could have been sad to make a decision within their own minds nobody helped you up until you get an application for renewal you 've got no decision to make and so until he made the application which was past the deadline for that last freed meeting of the year there was there was no consideration for you to to undertake in your governance role so the first opportunity is now because that 's he 's given that application and making that decision if you need some more information than I was here together those dishes so what it suggests for you mr. chair that if this general was not fulfilling the 't reapplying should that not have been brought to our attention certainly not standard procedure so your role as governance is to approve the licenses and staff where you monitor enforce those licenses in in this case because of that history of non-compliance you 've got the office of recommendation there it 's now up to us governance of the side what you do with that turmeric and Eileen very quickly follow that up with the resolution that 's before us where it actually says this councils preferred option not during you and that 's also where D news and the license for smash calf which is in the confidential part while we write in the word preferred when who 's preferring it look at the reasons of looking if you look at the resolution it meets ins the word for third option on page blue top of three bars I one gets ki hai decline the application food option I believe that 's as counsel to the free committees responsibility to work out what does the preferred course of action not something to be attached to and you drivin if you go to three bar three or three and two thousand which as we 're solutions are through three bar one resolution three that 's the proposed resolution from officers for you to consider which says their counsel declines the application there 's no food and but we 've also provide a or resolution that if you disagree with the officer recommendation you may choose to approve it I stand by original point mr. chairman that sexy states when we go through and read the agenda items something is preferred where that becomes the indicative resolution that we 're going to pass how did how do they know already that we 're going to decline the application and again it 's the article the purpose of an item asansol officers to give our recommendation our recommendation is our preferred option is that the application be declined hints that assessment on three by three your job is governance is to decide on through the resolutions which for those who that you wish to do things Jim my concerns have been recorded I noticed some there 's been quite a bit the meeting that you 've had a lot of dialogue since I email would anyway with the applicant yeah Casa hobby you know I have something clarified please on page 32 where it says under discussion it should counsel decline the license application mr Sutherland will still be able to operate as commercial activity on the lake but will not have the benefit of the license to trade on reserved land so does that mean he can stall as around so they 're their decision record from capsules be there we grant central reserve lend we don 't have any authority over the activity on the lake and so if you decline to grant the license on reserve lend as long as mr. Sablan his has required certificates and licenses and lean on approval to operate on the lake then you can continue job right on the lake where does he come and go from tomorrow or even if we decline as application what does that Wells can 't dude albatros ahead but they have master whose indicating that he 's not complying with the radio sleep yeah what he better use our reserve as part of his activities so we 've got to set up as can point out on our reserve with a signer Jennifer 's other go sell the trips from there and he can still launch his jet skis and people were liking the other name of the publicity paises boat ramps these in as long as you can try to have master regulation okay whatever we can we deal the first resolution first would be a good thing the walk on water balls has anyone got any queries ones new you get you a virgin losing that one you worship I can 't do it sir sounds fun great yeah my idea you know I 'll digging it yep so that 's been moved by canceling seconded by Councillor body any other questions and queries it this is the first ones to walk on water balls can still have he 's prepared to take the first walk on water I did because he normally walks on water anyway I one it 's the one end to you canceling yeah i 'll just say oh I second by castor body will rose in favor please say aye it 's against okay I turn ok so the jet ski hire mr. Daniel Sullivan seven you 've got the officers recommendation there is any other questions or queries on the lr on the sort of children there is I 'd like to know reaches and regard to silage I 'll wait to the council 's website and look up signage and just yet sort of ring the office going through this document some of them had on private land can you just refreshes what 's the ability for a private operator to advertise a business on private land versus a council car space where exactly did he go wrong and I know there 's a lot of dialogue over those months and so the license allowed him to have a small sandwich board sign and he was packing a big billboard sign around the place where he didn 't have learned oh no people to do that and when he packed it on private land it was still unfortunately in breach of the district plan rules which have was the rule that he was in breach of and through you mr. chairman did he after your approaches to him change the operation of those signs did he did he comply shifts keep shifting I gave him the benefit of the doubt and he kept shifting back m squad have you got an update on the sequence of events here or issue here by allowing the activity of the Colonel 's ooh we 're going to operated after two years has pretty much ignored our rules all the way through with me near dialogue with them were trying to be equivalent to the signage is blatantly just ignored us and importantly with Hector pretty much on a prosecutor or in French and for those science was only at the very process we basically said look you 3d_._802.249 your lease from the reserve names on the following year they actually started called Messina and it was to assure it was one effect that her sides we agree but it was also all the other operators in town oh this busy summer period we 're fully could follow the rules have they pleased what is it was a bit of a character or system offender wasn 't until we threatened to take away his license that he actually pulled sea of the other and he knew the rules all the way through the multiple discussions and multiple offices result in the actions so mr. chairman the other operators that complain that they complain the writing or verbally to the office I think that line through service requests so secondly do you believe that if the license was granted again he would or would not comply history I 'd say that we were hacked up calling here you would all make let me have predicted something to do no we 're going to get into what rules are he has indicated he 's willing to fly accessories shows it 's just through the chair though to clarify the letter that was received from mr. general Sutherland attachment six which is actually date at the eighth of October so that was quite some time ago he says census final warning he has not had any compliance issues would that be correct at all longer than that so much basically if all the signs of me pretty much present operate from the end of January that was when you issue the final warning didn 't even hear shoes after their okay so he was he did have a pic just to clarify then he did have a period of operation after that where he was compliant because you issued the final warning on the 21st January after a meeting with him on the 69 hey i paraded last year off the top my head until mid-february he was confined once what he 's saying in his letter is once he was clear the goddess of whatever he was but i mean we 're talking about just to raise mr. councillor bodies point earlier about the free committee this this application muster being received before the eights of october so that was nearly two months ago yes sir park I just like to add four and those councils who rent here in the last rhenium bet when we originally granted this gentleman has first license there were some safety concerns regarding that jet skis on to mull bay area and the gruesome issues around there as well they have master into that moving Herman end and so yeah I 'm actually in support of the recommended resolution to decline his application this time around there 's been two summers of and of some issues and I don 't want to stifle small business and operators getting out and being proactive but I just feel that as a as appeared and as n is a in all size council just of the ongoing issues around safety end and I think flouting their signage compliance and there yeah it should be declined this time around just to point a note though thank you through the cheer that his safety operating procedures have already been approved by the harbormaster 's as were the safety operating procedures for the balls just recently so they have been approved yes through that you like last time my two summers ago and he still didn 't stick to them okay we coolin food look it 's about engine if the license is granted the game we have the ability remember there 's that license would that be correct to pull the license to do sentences if we grab the left renew his license and he doesn 't comply with the requirements of that license we can pull it at any time that 's crazy coach can really offer just for 11 season or was he requesting a long as it 's a term of three months I 'm council only have the ability to grant a short up to six month and term license for summer recreational activities along life front so he would have to apply again next year as well or renew it on the basis that the next infringement it 's immediately canceled okay so I got a bit over here justjust canvas the idea perhaps given one last shot here 's one more warning then it 's immediately canceled yep LTS the media mr. Chairman I would move number four we agreed to grant a license for the period of three months so is it ever going to see into play in a second like a senior vice chancellor heckling anyone knows what we speak anyone last one 's number three members right number three is even more this the else want to speak in support of it if it be on procedure mr. Chairman I care before because it 's complete opiate Nadia that you can talk against it and doesn 't I agree with an R Council apart from that one I just think he 's had enough times starting to keep going back in from olive branch out resolution anyone else want to speak in favor aye solution okay anyone want to speak against against the resolution my views and I missed you yep anyone else okay so we 've got a mover in a second day here we want to have a last say okay but the puts the resolution number three although the liberal councillor parks in the bar council ethically yep or doesn 't hopefully say I those against yeah so its motion is carried thank you love you Cory evokes please record please cancel body and can search on us it refers _"

my older bro to kakaya an eye on a more later tena koutou tena koe tell Tina Kotek Tommy cancer from Chloe talk that would be good that 's all kill it everyone basically I 'm a lot of thinking in terms of running through this that 's obviously read through the item but I thought it would be good for me just to talk through some of the specifics of the truck and just blew things around at the moment the juice projects that are underway and we r we were progressing to even their relationship with China and so basically the itinerary and let me David in I took was a very quick five days in China the first two were in Shaolin 18-19 China New Zealand me reform so it was ourselves a moment and live in other councils yeah I think they were soon to three then our delegation and there were town city planner um it was very very well attended age head national TV coverage and coverage in radio coverage groups fantastic so it was it was a fantastic form huge available I think for New Zealand China relationship and particularly for local government relationship is we discussed before we meet the position of a mere and then China is very senior and very well respected so building that guanxi between the two countries and acting as his and ink and was usually important and you know the feedback that we had from attending net in terms of the credibility or taupe or to be seen to be spectrum was was very you know very well received by our partners over there from a outcome perspective you know we went and lovely objective of building our guangxi and relationships with China and looking at ways in which we can fill those relationships and building connections by the China particularly with the various new zealand councils and the approach that they were taking with China and and we definitely achieved it and probably one of you know the relationship that we and eztv captain was fantastic and actually ended up wound up being the position we were able to call on that you know listen it was my chest I think just over a week later that the lock and bath announcement was made we were able to make a phone call straight to the Consul General say we have some nervousness from our Chinese investors can you please alleviate that and it was done by most dangerous up there so that kind of relationship is absolutely invaluable that we were able to be in the position so that was the mirror form and we then flew and sorry just included a net was the opening of the China International fear for investment and trade we chose not to exhibit it bet because of the cost and the return on investment was not deemed to be great enough and but there was a fantastic we were the host country for that new zealand wad and so we had a fantastic photo exhibition so we need five photos from Cobourg i 'm showing various different industries from a picture of me like well and the mind by Calvin since none of them and traveled from the authority no no we visited the fennel and guangxi wood processing group because it isn 't that during the feasibility study for the total wood processing plant and the vet was apps even the fact that we were able to take a mere all the image was incredibly well-received so much so that when I translated some of the emails back into English we had after the fact family is coming and any reports back to us they really are very engaged with that they 're looking to us build a relationship with no known as a city so there may be an opportunity to get to support this initiative to produce then we saw the plant which was fantastic and I 'm pleased to say that the environmental and quality at legals of their client is second to none being through to visiting shall check this is our friendship city and we had the opportunity to sleep some more time is a secret of that this year and in meeting with the advice me eschew so that was fantastic and we actually had a relationship we 're actually getting on and progressing and these discussions so a number of discussions were progress while we were in and shouting particularly around the ongoing development work at power power Raj the consensus never be important to extend it to make sure that that developments are producers and I understand they 're looking to do that within 2-3 years the progressing the thousand tourists promotion so the government is subsidizing the thousand for us come down that to tow port and hoping to head a further discussion yearly in November with that group and to understand the timelines we 've got some packages that we 've put up to the battle bet we visited Sampson proposed stores anything hidden reason on the store which was stopped opal products so looked in a number of different locations forget Ainge yet ongoing discussions around tourism promotion and having businesses and functions then went through to so Joe and again with business to see the pseudo since 2008 this relationship and kind of was quite quiet for a while but again be does it in jaipur at the end of Movember again is the first time with heading arrow delegation from cinco to topple a number of years so it 's great to see that we are opening act eyes again we 're looking at a couple of projects specifically at the moment one of those are some school exchanges and which we 've already started progressing which is fantastic that 'll be great to look at some teacher and they were exchanges and then also continue to sin sentir school and scholarships that we hopen take a cough and then the other side i think which is really great from the so joy perspective is the partnership that we have with our museum we hosted the director of pseudo museum the day after we got back from planets that was a very busy kezia week back here and type or end that was also attended by totally me to show geo so it was great to have our turkey and involved and we 're looking at some cultural partnerships and a museum relationship that we can look at you know to put it towards holla in pattern shirts on it so that 's a bit of a quick run through the itinerary and the key areas that we looked at and if you 've got any Christians linking hopefully this Chloe any questions or queries cancer kosowski I just application than one thousand tourists that we are talking about it was my understanding that with business people not actual tourists so that we understand that they are highly within the medicine the even believe you know you know that 's it yes visitors the reason why I say that is because presumably the itinerary for 1000 business people looking to invest will be somewhat different yeah so we 're looking at doing a mixture of the tourism size things and silver pictures product and as I saying all that she needs a significant presence opportunity being social and the other point I 'd like to make is that when the Chinese delegation came to this jazz museum as an opportunity not just for towns in but also very strong connection was made with Matty 24 hour and there seems to and build a relationship on cultural basis which is not an opportunity to be missed that is it thank you can Koski any other questions or queries floating that s about a few be repaired 29 bar for and I like a solution to answer it 's not your deepest very outline before the prison were as follows but the screw the one regards of mainly in the group that got every woman program processing plant need to explore a petite relationship with the municipal government we did that know what could you do that 's the learning yes Henry musicals yeah they will obviously looks on this feasibility study the company is not company yeah I think we 're working we 're still working on it ok yeah so that some partnership that we will do in partnership with phone line group this is it 's very important that the big thing that was really interesting when we talk about business and government and try their intrinsic Lee late in colon group are privately owned company they 're listed on the stock exchange in China they 're not a is in China is a they do receive a lot of support from the Chinese come because they are seen to be part of the government so they tend to get you know opportunities and promoted a lot more for them to be able to have us to engage within a name directly meet they got to meet them here they 'd never let the me they 've never had that relationship so they be a long seeding manner effectively was increased by that so what we 're looking at doing is working in partnership with Finland to progress what that relationship might look like we don 't know whether that will be a sister city we don 't know where there might be a friendship city it will be very based on how things progress with the feasibility study so that 's something we need to continue to work in partnership and too heavy you know put together still got a full of it looking at 95 in regards to the sister city the second one down through the strength and relation towards developing assist with certain status a with those projects be around insane page nine but I live at the bottom it 's the show on the show shankari yes so so basically the idea is that the pledges that we 're working out which I 've just meet under a thousand tourists promotion Sister Cities shot permiso install that they 're looking at doing and the development out at Caracara wrote those are the types of projects they want to sleep regression it around developing us into a force is just a relationship so it 's an ongoing partnership thank you Jessica legit yes I was all I have nothing live today so I 'm very good thing while I mean my phone shows just what we talked about aquaculture it needs only what was what we sorted out me say agriculture industry yes so that 's the finished cutter procedure around and finish at adecco and tells it the christian club versus do it a kiss it better okay yes yes so basically it 's just discussing and we 've had some interest out of são joão about having trap included in the eco town anyways idea so they 're looking at having a it 's a tourism product that they 've gotta be a toy tell me um there are some significant Abunda challenges that need to be considered in terms of doing it so we 're continuing to look at it but at the moment it 's um like I say it 's a really station without you do in the future thank you 9.7 image bottom you see the itch get moving forward lose your head Chinese business cat so it 's um I think it 's relevant when we 've got visit so for example I 've got Chinese business card new David does will signal does groomers here Mulder losers burner does and one thing I noted we we hosted and a delegation and Barry was hosting them and didn 't hear a Chinese business card and so it 's just one of those moments where it 's not it 's a nice to head it 's not a neat to hear necessary but it definitely shows that you 're quite serious about that and you know I 'm not all but it 's definitely an opportunity to to show it for those who are engaging with tons of efforts it shows that the speech is it sushi sushi okay thanks though hey I just like

down to this a typo has free spotters seven bar 20 and the definition for skateboard instead of means a shot narrow mobile device it should be short we all but any questions any questions of jane so so sorry this also a platform of the resolution is required some counselors to go on to the committee yep so there 's just a quick day also and sinbad Tweety when it gets english love us for it uses steak though so another well even one thank you what some chocolate batter cancer cousins Justin credible than the scene by 23 the metal no state law area into a second part ways to a road car park which is like this right from the 50s Kieran stapled over and around reform scooters and I 've always through yet i think is really made at problem for ourselves in the future I was also pushing what cable for astronomy was clueless as rain and so the Mets were taken directly from the current and by law and if you 'd like and change we 're happy to do so I 'm sure they don 't want skateboards and Annie popular so Edison yeah we 'd like to get Thank You cancer cousins cancer kosowski may just ask a couple of questions under the definition of skateboards I notice that there 's a lack of his scooters is that a deliberate absence or no it 's it 's pretty much if you would like Downers includes absolutely headed impediment my practical experiences they 've kids on skateboards and or rollerblades every month every bit as of illusions in the CBD as kids on scooters the rest of the people think yeah effectively the definition covers them but if you want it as a sort of like information it 's absolutely we can implement and my next point is on 47 by 20 and point 17 we talked about that person must not consumed in general and had any psycho substance I practice substance in which should be 't go on and saying that interferes with the safety why do we not just have a full point after place and so the psychoactive substances and definition of illegal substances it 's not under the misuse of Drugs Act so it 's things that will do something to you but are not necessarily illegal substances so pretty much we can state that 's something that 's legal and we can 't_''_241.48 say no without a reason so that 's why it interferes with somebody sound bite on the actual reserve so yeah how do I explain this and blue glow is effectively illegal substance what they do with it is not necessarily a good thing mrs. with their minds they do silly things and then they could interfere with a person 's right to use a review they 're like this it makes sense don 't necessarily agree with it yeah I know the last point on his seven 528 talk about residential environment does that imply that people could have animals birds and these by default in the cvd I will defer to the district playing expert yes we can certainly bring in the top town safer environment and uncertainty can sister oh sorry and that 's a very little late what if someone in your parent in the CDD we 've just worked out yes so we 're going to include the CBDs now he is thinking I can I 'm going to point out is for a minute on page 7 by 24 year for a mattress make the Oviatt a missile minutes I think we need to immune that Napa to preach we 've not include really really nice okay it 's there it 's already there I am are you on the black and white one in the red it 's quite clear that nice little green business apparently where the skate park is yeah guys suddenly in words okay not a problem again that 's exactly the same as the current body okay thank you judge you guess a buddy some clarification on sitting by a 13 right at the bottom number nine that 's Felicity neglected the nation or preaching you 're preaching means actually standing on a soapbox and preaching but pamphlets Izzy basically that 's what 's currently in the current by law we then have the administration of that particular part as tough town centre administer the actual run final what I 'm getting it I can understand actively soliciting or preachy but for Steve and hearing something else people walk past that wouldn 't be against that vial with it again they had to go for a license and talent seems a tugboat administer that explore next to the contrary to what it we 've brought up at the last meeting so we 're the esteem is still here near that or actively preaching is really irrelevant consents to town centre talented help i do it merciless so if you would wish me to change the bylaw i 'm happy to do so well i 'm trying to get break it down if you stay in there the stationary position handing something out making no comment or ethnically preaching so what you want to know that you 'll have to do that or not I want to know when you get these things Dylan good point yep yes though there 's no people were to apply to town centre to learn to total Isis having declines are there any circumstances so we just want to clarify that please because whatever what about people when they put stuff on when screams come around town center andalib did issues there if I could just jump in this on the first just to be very clear on your point counselor body your Bible set up so that you want to actively breach then as it currently says in the Bible you need to seek a license and there 's a process we 've got for that we given that process to talents into tampa if you want to simply stand on the corner with a pile of leaflets and hold them out towards people then that wouldn 't be preaching and you will require a license to do that under the current bible as its draft appear I think they care about in terms of the second point around the process that counseling to telco goes through that process that they administer you as the body you who ultimately his reader guidance about how you 'd expect that to take place boy you could obviously look at that regulatory role being dispensed by yourself okay council sure just original make my lord how do we talking about tazi to talk with it 's the charcoal interior you want to transcend to talk idly went but they come to counsel how will that affect someone who 's sitting outside you connected to be her essay or something like that they have to give and get a large attention from cancer you know it 's how I 've written it is basically relevant approval so just probably even a phone call right pinky 43 is doing aboard and you let there 's what comes into play ball okay cancer because clusky just a dream or clarifications sake if there is a kid wanting to play outside would quit cause on his harmonica whatever what is the procedure under the under the proposed yes they go to town center tower play for approval to play music for you think we can seem to tell power basically administering this particular specific function under this particular the nature of that podcast games with your life and those will consult with their businesses as we around the post hoc and make sure the low heavy some conflicts and always and stuff on it and that were texting NEC conditions around edification and other phone and license and an inmate ebay a monitoring complaints paste follow up with measures if the point okay stand like a logical conclusion to do said how kids or people know what the procedures going to do that 's on the website saved on both councilman counting the total loss Your Honor websites about three and that we who to a vital for the license and be honest usually counseling there 's always those issue that they can cure of the twice corrected easily infection summer months of an example they have to be paid piece of comedic rather than the people from a project so yeah the data isn 't the recital food all right ok any other questions of Jane and neck I 'm just so what we

resolution there and Casso Jones is not in here he 'd follow them broke counseling or as in favorable sorry please say yes I so okay okay item number six adaption of the type of district cancelled annual report 2014-15 Jeanette and dream good afternoon ladies thank you for a nice glossy copy well obviously we 're workshop this and it was basically just going back but if you type isn 't a few clarifications wasn 't it so anything you further to a report I 'm so festival aggressiveness I just like to have a huge thick head of the columns Department sure a rally in particular who 's done this amazing document we can now print on calorie below because it 's as cheap as printing in black and white so what you see is what will be hunted and there 's only a few changes from the workshop that we hold about a month ago in terms of the financials in ray and for the major one and as mentioned at the equation that we were going back in looking at that and also the correction of the depreciation which was also mentioned that they workshop and we have also removed the lake toba protection trust from your boxes and associate because it does not meet the real counting standards you know refer to it as well at the workshop so those are the name and here is where there are differences for those of you that go through and check those things I really don 't have evidence to urge and it 's received a clear opinion from the original surface and also have a code a tap on for the summary as well which is don 't really have it so it is so they 're both good to go basically so I 'll take any questions understands to add on that that we made the changes as per the workshops go thanks Jane thanks Jeanette any questions or cause of councillor kruszewski hate to be a real pain in the neck but on page hundred forty-seven here the slightest annual under the pl fun we still 995 was 95 on and the other one on that document is that we 're still on the last page on 170 we still refer to a inset National Bank Limited no such peace yes that 's what I remember that one I thought I made that change outside and if I can go on to the summary one on page five paragraph second line should read 2014 fire 2005 and the footer on that page should be 2014 2015 Thank You counselor I 'm just saying my way they 'd prefer these documents probably between about six people quite a few times they haven 't been printed years over no no yes thank you can suppress us ki vigilant eyes of yours ok any other calcium I I 've discussed a number of issues with them but the mr. men hena in regards of some figure changes in the two documents he mentioned there was some revaluation and appreciation I don 't know where I need to go through the one by one Ellen is informed that probably something that the the Audit Office has picked up but one and the fish report we look that is what 's now on page 59 it relates to the satisfaction targets of our three swimming pools the two documents are different so in which page 59 of the new document and page 50 of the old one the pre are the draft draft and there have been a couple of changes that the auditors different pic taps that we 've had to alert so specifically which one was it well would be with the one to do with the pools first one we got and i 'll refer to the AC baths it states we had achieved seventy-four percent seventy-four percent sixty-nine percent that new one says 82 82 and 98 for the AC baths oh yes that was definitely one that builders has picked up that was uncorrect they picked it up so can you give me a guarantee that all those other financial figures that are different because of audit or that 's not a financial feeling its own in a bavarian is it but I have other figures where the first document as figures on particular issue that that we go to your own workshop day was a report that we gave to audit and so any changes that have been married have been have occurred through the Europe process will through their items that I mentioned before regarding moving Russian and depreciation and stuff so there were few in terms of the overall result there are very few members that changed throughout the document and notes though they may have been some disclosure changes that we had to make so and will not have been expressing something in one category when it 's better and another so those things do happen it with it and that the ovary numbers apart from the things that I 've mentioned have not challenged money mr. chairman in the future whether we could have that listed and it 's and there 's been there 's been quite a lot of change in terms of disclosures and a staff in or just do it but it 's practical for us to actually show you all of those it would be today it simply benefit well we benefit for me mr. chairman as goes out is correct and the reasons why there a difference between the two if I 'm going to go through a workshop and go through a annual report and then to find the next document that 's different and it might be only marginally I would like to have that information through the to the financial reporting for the financial year just ended and there are a number of accounting policy changes staff have interpreted those changes that then audit have actually tweaked our interpretation so if we gave you the explanation as to the difference between one and the other a lot of it there 's accounting speak and hence the question is too in what way would that assist you in adopting the report right okay thank you you have a questions or cruiser Chinese and Jane okay well that 's good well thank you very much ladies and gentlemen and counselors in the end of a year a busy year and I think we can be very proud this of the Samuel port 18 million dollars less debt than what we had a start rate rise the Double A credit rating that you receive from seven pause you know that 's not an easy task so well done to Ellen and your team and the girls down the back as well and gentlemen and the back so thank you very much so suggested resolution there that we proved the annual report and release it to the public moves to my counselor body yes so I second it do we

    "text": "item number four and i think in eurasip chief executive officers report said September 's side is not a heck of a lot to report however I just want to alert you to the dishes Leslie is relatively important moving forward and on a positive residential sector I see no more growth this year and so it plays into say 20 watts in typo district term in July and 16 in August with 104 the new residential what 's in 2015 that 's quite a positive sound and the 16th of March teachers of the bear plenty polytechnic and working institute of technology announced that they will explain a potential merger and then student choice made a further public comment on that lab later in the year and and now there is consultation period which has just finished but there 's a couple has been consultation period in the websites worth keeping around that project staff put together a a submission in Latin there was an there is a paper on this agenda sadly as staff will be entitled to get and the extend an extension to that consultation period health and safety legislation which is controversial now we 're in the authority I wouldn 't necessarily sighs controversial it is what it is it 's the health and safety legislation that was passed extérieure to be noticed and will come into force on the fourth day pro just when should we emphasize to everybody in the room that training opportunities have been organized very less shared service opportunity and so there will be two training courses available one in Hamilton and one into a career that I would suggest that you do your best to avail yourself of that training opportunity I shall certainly be attending the morning session with an elected members that are interested and I may even better hang around for the afternoon session for our senior staff to I mean that the reporter Stoker 's read and we 're happy for questions thank you thank you mr. Williams for your report any questions councillor Christos key yes thank you for that they 're just a matter of expansion or clarification are for my pad place under the four-bar to add an attitude for a char you sort of explain a little bit on that for me please I could do close to journey expendable pleasure vocals and so this is to do with both the governance of particular pieces are lane that that make him go back to 24 at all which counsel may have a roland so join governance committees of land holdings and of a reserve keyboards a dozen confidence but a proposal for a piece of policy work that has a joint committee with this council in white color regional council so it won 't as such have an effect on impact on our next year 's delegation policy review just making sure listen Ian you 'll be hearing okay down the back so quickly cool okay all right this influential council body I 'm on for bar six in regards to the I 'm delaney stadium lighting LED lighting yep its stated that the consultations or discussions and early September is there any update on that attention has been paid with Scott TV I 'm not entirely sure what the philip has been from that mental or because our staff members get a little drew they 're still talking about it is it simply mr. chairman on for bar seven that might just be a word the operator if the pump stations and generators at lower place it 's got prizes being sought from preferred vendors should it be tender as i thought a vendor was something that 's sold something rather than the quick terminology baby may develop empowered some of them do isn 't Pope titled castle park out you thank you I 'm pay on pool bar for Justin regards to the water Hanoi water treatment plant upgrades we 've been through some consultation and it says that the consultation with the community is still progressing I 'm just wondering what the timetable is with that because i did a tender making a while ago and I just feel probably I just want to make sure that the communications still like them with yep we recently sent an affair the letter to the community advising in that we we 're still concern children that there was no information being prepared we 're optimistic of beer a paper or will quit her counselor cousins through the chair just on page four bar 30 sticking from the bottom bring the green dot indicates been on track it 's what I percent of the district feel of what one word about counselors long-term direction for counsel but last year it was fifty two percent which means we 're tracking downwards so we plan to be at zero where is that a goal I just think maybe they shouldn 't be on track there should be my Jeep it 's achieved that the target is forty-nine percent in Europe you achieved 52-percent all right I 'm reading it all right ok I see entry good thank you yay some of it oh thank you thank you four streams for your report I 'm sorry cancel children and yes I an attachment to the treasury management report on me and I could you just explain the pre-funding sorry that 's a serious plan yet we have a loan tranche that comes out for a renewal and April of 2016 a window of opportunity is presented itself to pre-fund bed and we have listed page or page for you will see down the bottom in the section for we actually do show that pre-funding possession where that 25 million accrued interest on investment this you accrue interest on the deer you can see we 're already starting to make money on it so we 're just a matter of taking an opportunity that presented itself in the market remember we did the same thing last financial year Oh George yes they 're just following on from councillor Truman 's comment why do we not include these figures in our performance calculations because we make a comment here that we don 't include these borrowing and investment figures in our performance calculations we 've tried to align our performance calculation with the treasury management home policy and by having the 25 million on both sides of the ledger in student netting it off actually distorts the comparison with the reformist statistics my second question through the chair then place was on page three baths a three of four of treasury management report our actual asset allocation is way out of the bounds of our target is when we in January sold the 20 million IMG bond which represented forty percent of the portfolio and have you can remember the interest rate on that was five point two eight percent so we 've now been struggling to reinvest it at much more than four percent it 's actually increased our short-term deposits because there 's very little corporate paper around as far as long-term investment that 's concerned so that the money is now sitting short and that 's distorting our ratios in terms of our ratios that is a significantly inconsistent it 's significantly inconsistent to our policy what are we doing to make sure that people understand that and when will we rectify that we will rectify when the math policy that we are yeah will rectify it when the market conditions changed such that borrowers start coming out with corporate paper that a meets our credit ratings and B is of an attractive enough yield for us to start going back long-term with our investment so in your view and if you apply the principles under section 80 of the local government act what we 're doing doesn 't no longer fits with our policy no we 've just through the long term plan process we have changed our some of their performance measurements within our policy these are new ones or the old ones that are we seeing here today the new ones we 're seeing today because they came in effect from the first of July and we will be outside those particular ratios as long as the market stays as it is at there 's no paper available to invest into then we have to stay short with their bank deposits I mean and I completely understand the market conditions that have put us in this position but I just we sat in a workshop with PricewaterhouseCoopers several months ago when we decided and on the treasury management policy we made decisions on what would best practices and it just on paper this looks like we 're outside that this practice and outside that policy and we need to be very careful and about how we manage those and whether that means that our policy is correct well we also the policy because our only option as far as fixed interest investments and keeping in mind the subdued appetite for equity investment we have a very heavy exposure into the banks do any other choices into higher risk fixed investments and so we 're not prepared to put the phone book versa oh no and I would completely agree with you but I say we 're operating under a policy that we we can 't follow I think with counselors dollars for asses can the can the policy be changed to suit the suit the market give us some more flexible so when is the opportunity to change their policy we have to next in your name excellent basically it 's your policy so if you agree to go outside the parameters of your policy that is your decision it 's not I guess the owner gets on bringing it to our counselors attention that we are outside of that policy and we need to acknowledge that and highlight that I mean I find it a little bit frustrating to be honest that I get this report the day before the information with less than a day to analyze it and I 'm finding that very difficult I don 't think that 's fair on us counselors either when we get these sorts of things didn 't strike I just a little but I think the important thing is that you informed that the the information is here because of staff the tee off and called that the committee could actually increase the share of equities both international and Australian and stay well within the policy but they don 't believe that that is the best form of investment at this point in time so that is the purpose of this this information so that you are aware that you are outside the policy but there are good reasons to be outside the policy through the cheer at the service yeah episode 10 de meeting last year and counselors passed a comment that there are no financials at that particular stage we advise counsel that we have been working to complete the annual that you 've got once again 12 months down the track and it taking into account the their butts off to produce a set of financials that is to tabled for the September council meeting this time keeping in lies your comment of 12 months ago hence you only received it in the last 24 hours with that note then next time around we could expect to get not necessarily depends on the work involved in producing the audited annual report which you have tabled here today okay cancer heckling does that mean no your worship but we should be passing a resolution to move out of our policy for until the finance comes right or not no I think I think we working before what must have inheritors try to explain that the condition at the moment is outside the policy but as soon as the bonds become available or notes become available will be within the policy so it comes in and out of the the policy is it if you refer back to each of the months for the latter half of the last financial year you will find that this particular situation occurred and it 's not hasn 't just started it 's answered corporate bond just to further add to the counselors question with regards to that i think the fact that we 've minuted the conversation is important i think also the fact that you have a resolution to have received a report is sufficient to this point in time however an hour we remain outside of the policy it may well be worth as Bo away a resolution to at some point in the future just to have some commentary on the market conditions and then we do believe it may no change for us and I think that will keep Rover on that over the next couple of months impossible the paper on a resolution to you to assist with that concern the body during there 's two issues one is the one we were just discussing the out in fact a previous council moved a resolution to very policy for that BBB so that you did that obvious protection I don 't know so I 'm wondering with that what we 're talking about the moments a wise move but what I want to refer to as attachment about this particular short term breach now no this is to the 31st of august so the notes from the shop since mature lon three theaters at timber council is now back within policy limits so that 's heaven after this was printed Ellen 's it would that be created this correct as far as exposure to each individual bank was concerned amid I was surprised to get these because going on last year we didn 't get now so thank you for that yeah but what I want to also raise is that in a previous document it actually said this would not happen again this should this wouldn 't happen from the first of July 15 well it has happened so I 'm just wondering whether somehow that we 've ended up and they have been made that comment that it won 't happen again here Custer cousins just yet a couple of things I endorse what counselor Jolin said I was reading the financial report and I he what you 're saying Ellen without a doubt but I was reading this document last night eleven o 'clock I was doing it again in this point out of my weakness there 's no point giving us one you have the report without the other and then experience that you thoroughly informed okie what you 're saying about time factors with the crew in then that all these come at once or in a timely fashion for us is what counts the jolons are saying and I take on board what you 're saying but we can apply the way through that that we fantastic moving on from that just under attachment the Tetra we 've got for the financial than the financial update I spoke to this all emo co2 swooned out staffing levels and it has given me great clarification that we 're now at 355 staff than the council environment excluding ccos as soon as me as our wage bra was climbing quite dramatically from 17 point eight million and 2013 to propose 19 6 50 this year I I 've met through gained 13 you staff members but it seems incredibly high I just wanted a top table answer on everything I think the long-term part of the results that we will achieve over the next 10 years in terms of the long-term planning our staffing where was built into that long-term planning and so I don 't foresee any huge issue in relation to staffing when I first arrived to earth of those figures were 455 about 380 I have two years and now you 're sitting what 355 move to item to item left to me so well known as we concerned about that or that the apps the downside for me is that our income has an increased to offset that ratio that we might consider I urge caution moving forward with that one and one another question for Alan hope I hope you can answer just talking to take total net assets we 're currently at 1 billion six hundred and eighteen thousand I could be reading it wrong from previous annual annual report that seems to decrease or am I reading those documents wrong from 1.2 5 6 1.2 million or two hundred million 2 1,000,000 now am I reading them I could be interpreting them off incorrectly at the you got here is 1 million second donating one billions 618 thousand its compute against the previous years well in the assets worth it could be misinterpreting those buggers well there 's two factors in one is the revaluation of assets at the end of the financial year second one is the transfer of the ETA across the nzta which if you remember was a substantial head on our P&L so that is in fact the main movements and the le of the assets okay thanks to ensure that the liabilities not just the changes of the bypass two months of 31 orbits on the G naught into the financial performance one to left assets a 1.2 billion net 1 billion sorry you need to revoke the net amount or the total like that is what the bell cheater Shane at the moment well the total liabilities of course take into account that 25 million pre-funding and so therefore flows through to the the assets on the other side but the net possession is pretty much in line with what we 're predicting it to be at the end of vist 998 good on there has an existence and reading the income statement and the financial update it 's got total operating revenue in the first part of the figures should that be compared with the long-term plan figures for the start of this financial year so when we go to the full-year budget in this particular document the thumb of the yellow lines should that correspond with the first year 's total operating expenditure in the long-term funding impact statement you 're talking about the two months to the end of august and only income statement there is the income statement full-year budget yeah will the year-to-date_``_1256.72 budget you will not have in the long term plan what the year-to-date budget is to the end of August it 's a whole year budget I 'm look at the full year well so it 's phased month by month you just not automatically got four years of audit by 12 and I appreciate that i 'm looking at the full-year budget which shows here 77 million the long-term plan total operating revenue for budget is a different figure so you was just a long-term plan will change no I didn 't have to make these she 's done so jennette okay thank you i 'm under if we can have a rider 's there because we 're trying to compare apples with apples we 're not able to do so okay thank you okay nice guess what do you think he Jeanette right there so bad four batters this is just a resolution there could i have a mover police for that thank you can suck ostrosky signal by Councillor williamson thank you all

Louis I got anything else has been given if we approved this contract there 's years that creep that 's correct and at the moment breeding this there 's no no one has asked for seal extensions so are we taking the gamble to the won 't be any or we just interfere that so it 's could you repeat that question I think is it if we accept this team that whether it says company or anyone else there will be no monies left for the 1516 budgeted year for cl extension and the district correct there 's no one else at the states was indicated that they wish something to be done so are we are we taking the gamble or do within just bring money back from the following year 's budget well I mean what 's the the suit and the decision and what rose to CL are based on a matrix that mr. tune with a number of years ago which suits had a priority of roads that could be sued and in we we are working their way through that matrix so he 's not work on that matrix if we prove this contract for this year we 've that expenditure used thank you right okay you have a questions or queries of mr.

cannot contract to the uncontacted hours for my three plus one plus one for the contract this is for the first one we 're extension of the contract and we 'll take the item is rude and taking questions they keep any questions guess so okay I 've just going to ask is what the what contributes to the increase in the contract price is it diesel causative stuff cause well and they readily assess nearly 200,000 on the actually two year contract price this is contract pass the additional forces Sam 193,000 which is for one year and which represents about an increase of about five thousand on if you work which is in line with learn CPR adjustments for the contract okay so it 's only with CPI adjustment is okay and that would incorporate Boyd few ways and yeah I just say something okay cancer no cancer Jones so my mouth 's might be out but um if you encrypt me from wrong Dennis but if you had a contract that was for three years that was roughly 564 be divided that by three what 's it comes honey my date I am ok yes it is only five sorry you 're right you mess around all that comment with kids so just follow from what council hookman said we 're under 4.1 where 's

increases based on the CPR thank you very cool in the current contractor he runs happy the job they do yeah i know you i had a raper t-wayne heater bumped into him at the service station and he

sculpture trust sculpture proposal defining horizons and with mr. john wooden and square anderson Clare and Nikki with me sergeant I 'll just the aight i 'll take the item is red now i 'll get flare and all Nikki to walk you through it because they 're the altering and Nikki Nikki Nikki they 're the artist types not me I 'm afraid similar okay okay thank you thank you for having us here today I hosted will have an apology from Julie temple who is a representative of the trustees of the graham watson estate she was to be here today but unfortunately she 's she 's at a funeral and could to give you a little background about the top ice sculpture trust we were formed in 2008 and we took our cue from Wellington City we decided that they and had lived the way as far as sculptures concerned and enhancing the environment with beautiful sculptures and so we thought well if I can do it in that city why can 't Talpiot and fortunately some years ago the typo council agreed that they would work together with us and we have always felt that tahoe is a marvelous sporting venture playground really wonderful events happen here and we were looking for a balance of arts and culture and sport and recreation and that has has been the majority of the feeling that we wanted to start installing some sculptures within the Taupo district and we have seven works on display at the moment for which we are very proud of and two are particularly dear to our hearts and they are the ones that came from our schools project which we started about three years ago where senior students from Tarpon area tia tamera high school submitted designs for those works to full scale and one of them is butterfly which is in the South domain by a top annuity student and the other one is to e which is in the to any chip and that was designed by a tongariro school student the feeling was we wanted to take sculpture art to the whole of the community and we decided that we 're better to begin then with our students and it also had the added advantage of giving those students a chance to make a design that may come to fruition which in fact to have and give them opportunity which they would not have otherwise head and during this process top o District Council and top o sculpture trust have forged a very strong relationship and I thank you all for that particularly john ridd at present as our go-to man and I know that Rob Williams and Gareth green have supported us all the way through this and that relationship is very important to us and you actually give us credibility and particularly when we are sourcing funds when we save that typo district we have raised that is generally the thing that people say yes we 're with you because we have explained that then the work will become an asset of Tokyo District Council and you know that that you will also be responsible for the maintenance of such works so that is a very important thing for us and we thank you for your support now we 're here today specifically because one of our past trustees mr. Graham Watson very generously left us a request of 25,000 it is no coincidence that the figure of 25,000 is the same as the top o District Council has in their arts ground so Graham I put that in his will and we were very overwhelmed by that that he was passionate about our mantra and going ahead and trying to beautify Tahoe and make sure that we could get some sculptures standing in our area he also became the major sponsor of 23 in two ringy the terms of his will and he wanted a site on the waterfront on the lakefront and all around the Lions walk he wanted have a Marcus can see oh yes yes and and of course the dollars he knew that if we had 25,000 from him we would hopefully get 25 thousand dollars from the Talpiot District Council so our search began to find a work and we found a work from grand Bennett who is a well renowned using sculptor and it fitted the criteria and it fitted the budget and it is cool defining horizons and you all have your submission in front of you and I hope that you have read and seen that and I just like Nikki if you couldn 't possibly bring read just a little bit more about Graham Bennett and defining horizons grain Bennett is based in Christchurch he 's a graduate of the University of Canterbury Island School of Finance has large scale works feature prominently in public places in including reasons for voyaging which is outside the Christchurch art gallery sea and sky kaipara as it gives farm and the car of harbor and reason to return as at connells bay it 's sculpture park most recently he has been invited to create a large 2012 this work is now permanently installed at the height I art valleys dr. Park and so he is truly a man a sculptor of a great significant is ably a provenance sculptor and New Zealand and I think we 're very fortunate that he is agreed to sell as per her sculptor thanks Nikki so I just like to conclude that we have our benefactor and Graham Watson we have found a sculpture defining horizons that fits the criteria and the budget and we just now need tarpor District Council to agree with our submission and to support our submission and to support our givers to further beautify the tougher area to make it a lovely place to live to make it a lovely place for tourism tourists to come and enjoy what we have in this beautiful place that we live so I ask for your support thank you thank you clear Thank You Mickey thank you for taking time come today and for your submission and castles have you any questions or queries against the process key question thank you for that and what type is the want to call them as such I made of that and painted steel at it so one of them is stainless steel the other one is mild steel and the other one is caught in steel 30 its robust it 's a perfect for public a public place and it is made of lasting materials that 's the cousins ladies for that um define horizons its name you have to define the interpretation of what does it actually symbolize because I was trying to get a handle on well yes basically it 's when you look at the shapes and there 's you can sort of almost see Walker were knut for new likes or sailing and navigation in his work and all of those things were used to bring people together as they did the canoes came to New Zealand it encompassed water and navigation really council park I think you worship and I totally support the topo at trust and just probably a question for staff more than anything because their monies and do commander a staff delegation is that being the beginning of a financial year in with the budget for public out being speaked so early in the financial year we 're not aware of any other proposals and that are currently at the point where that be ready to have a proposal casa jolons thank you cheer um I ladies welcome to and I 'm very very supportive of a piece of work of this I guess caliber and and yeah I really looking forward to seeing in the district we have a couple locations that that we 've identified that we can put public works out this location that we 've been discussing today which is opposite the whole 11 is that your preferred location for this piece it 's just off the end of 20 ponga street and just across the road so and that 's your third location out of potential other options yes I guess I think we have gone together as a group and looked at different places that we knew were available and that one seemed to fit the work and it just helped it wasn 't the other work at the place that we had we felt it the other works that we have and not too far away from the CBD not too far away from the hirai since either well that 's the idea is to look out over the water Council park I use just another and assurance from staff this with the placement of this piece of ass but was to go there that the issues with the embankment down by the hole-in-one have all been taken into account great Oh John everybody sorry is very quickly I think the questions have been asked you 've mentioned that the size of 3.4 on the photographs that we have here it seems to be higher than that I 'm trying to envision 3.4 and the concern I have it where you wish it to be is will it affect people coming down to a poner street in regards of a virgin but they look at that not to a knee lift a right to see what the traffic 's doing just just the location at the stage do you think it would create a traffic hazard as such I don 't believe so but because slightly south so when you 're coming down to two you are planning a streak oh don 't believe that you 're going to be distracted okay no just coming back to the material you reach in a number of different steals which I 'm unfamiliar would number those deals can take rusty importance 30 and is a rusted steel that 's naturally the environment has rusted it and and it stays the same it says it 's slightly theory sort of rusty color the rest is stainless steel and painted student so that piece of the of the structure is quite small there are there are sexy I personally haven 't seen it but one of our trustees have and she went down it is actually in Christchurch at the moment and so she 's seen it and in that that was wonderful because we had photos of her beside it to get the idea of scale which was very helpful to us because before that we were a little bit worried as you were as you are talk about scale how high should be and how it 's the reason I raised the question of the materials we had a lot of negativity about our big flower boxes around town that was steel and rusted so what I 'm saying what ten years time or five years time or three years time we don 't want criticism of material so if you have a look at on the water on the viewing platform now to the right hand side this up big piece there that 's Corten steel and to be quite frank I 've had nothing but compliments about those so I think people have got used to it it was just a bit of people 's cheese would be admit that her boobs at the time I think people got used to it now it 's fairly well used around the place to be honest I 've seen quite a lot of it proper cropping up a lot question then no staff have centers map locations that 's funny to you for any other sculptures have we ever committed the full budget on one particular sculpture in the past we have well it goes like it time thank you and that 's almost the only way why would we will get something of significance and a really important piece that holds its value and you know it really enhances the area as far as sculptures concerned so you can understand so its existing its undisplaced summary now existing yes so basically we 're procuring it off that the guy is the artist I Stallone 's it as he okay so obviously is been reasonable negotiations taking place yes yes yeah yes so yeah I 'm foreskin though mildly so you 're gonna deal yes we have and it was a hard deal and we know that we have got value okay cool so the actual like a transportation all that sort of things covered in there and the budget there 's no answer dental costs as well as well as as we 've agreed we will pay for the transport and to get the outer stop here to reassemble it has to be taken apart to transport put together again so Graham Bennett will have to come up here so the Talpiot sculpture trust will pay here and tarp I just accounts will pay for its installation okay all right so that 's all included in the budget life it 's all in yes so we won 't get an extra invoice for anything having their contribution yep yep yep Oh what excuse me here we also make that that it is GST and the you will get in fact 3150 back from GST so that will be left in your budget you 'll have about 4 grand live thank you thank you oh oh very good ok any other questions or queries and Mickey or John right very clear nice thinking

the current console title provide an evening with krishna being involved in it I turn Gavigan item sales yeah so can go i 'll see you yeah okay so would you like that amending councillor Williams spc item number six was love Williams first two verses okay and if I the comics journal 2 x 1 equal authority are referred to in general manager bought right at the wrinkle holiday for action world until the end of the lease is that because they are in arrears mobile can they not pay to the end of their periods and secondly the airport authority will make the decision on the caribbean association taking that area oh that odd question so while we release holiday rental holding the action world is currently on the market and should they not be successful and selling it then the airport will be taking out of the site the caravan association is indicated an interest and also reading that particular site from the airport should that become available appreciate us assume that is on the market but we we are giving them that rental holiday whilst we work with them to hopefully free up the site we don 't see the action world as being a viable business and also it 's not proving a positive as far as emphatically really airport is concerned we believe we can get a more sustainable income stream without any financial impact by letting it to the mobile caravan Association I 'm impossible three cheer up just to add to that the they had three months left on the lease and they wanted a rental holiday for the the third those three months but it was decided by the committee their foreheads

Mandela could explain to council why that 's changed by that 10 million surely we had 35 million of external debt that was cheerful repayment in April we had previously pre-funded 25 of it and through our CP program we pre-funded another 10 so it was 35 as at the end of March that pre-funding has rolled out during April and so gross debts reduced by 35 new investments of reduced by 35 during April but it was just an opportunity a few weeks out from the rollover of dead to lock it in at a attractive right Sophie be this time next month there won 't be anything there um yes the the gross debt at this particular point of time has 165 I 155 verse 390 that term is showing on page 3 by 23 it 's 35 of that was the pre-funding and as per the CEOs report you 'll see that our net debt is 72 million versus 78 million that we budgeted for and if further questions counselors from geralyn 's couple of months back we were advised that there was a report coming from Price Waterhouse Cooper there were two reports one was on compliance and one was on our treasury management policy as we 're going into deliberations next week can you advise when we will see that report the treasury management policy we received a paper with suggested changes to our treasury management policy which we meeting tomorrow to discuss because of the long term plan hearings etc we have got the clock really stopped on it um we 're very close to a final version to bring to counsel for them to consider we are looking at whether it 's worth having a workshop on it prior to the council meeting just to bring your own up to speed so it 's just medicine for me thank you through it Purdue of a couple more general just raise the question then regard to international equities in the investment wat wat age comes like 3 x 22 okay I notice that this is a fluctuating moving target but this month compared with last month they 'll international equity reviewed a three-bar 23 right at the bottom a gross external debt we can 't exceed 250 thousand we 're now two so two hundred fifty percent we 're now too 43.5 last month was too 31.9 and then moving on down gross external debt it 's now 18.5 it was 17.5 last month we 're supposed to have it at fifteen or below hopefully that will often the hope will that correct itself by this time next month I 'm through a cheer if we start with the international equities the reason why that is dropped by four hundred or thousands that we sold a parcel of NZ cheers the gross debt yes it is over the benchmark basically because that 35 million pre-funding and it will be within the video yardstick going forward stupid make it match I asked the men handled if I could have an update on our your fund equity transactions I was given a copy I don 't believe any of the other counselors were i 'm just wondering with a silo those aims he cheers whether we could have a update as of 's a moving target for example we met this morning and there are three sheer parcels in Australia that we have put terrorism as that today Martin happen today it might be tomorrow Exeter but as I say that it 's a moving beast is to win the information is collated but I have copies i had copies with me counselor at the last council meeting for each member of the council but you got yours after the meeting because the subject was not raised during the meeting ok sweets ridge national any honest with you think this will read out the place through our 23 see this previous understand 50m with the focusing work the more in stand with the official cash rights and fixed interest rates of quite like this obviously with the for example straw straw equal say again focusing to fill the seat will be Polly mention move from this prison for politics it because she has to be quite it 'll pick you a pic so Tom curtain exit so this isn 't worthy this being just look different but the other four percent that put some sailors in today because the Australian share markers it 's probably just highest it 's been for quite a long period of time thank you and if the questions on page 3 x 22 + 3 x 23 0 to 3 power 24 I will move on to the financial performance report just me three those pages and there are explanations on 83 power 28 of those differences or me through 23 bar 30 and 31 given just just no matter of figures I believe in three bout 31 they figures down nine and future lecture be ten on the living just just repeat my counseling burden I 'll just run it when we get to the lights oh yeah it goes for miles on the right-hand side yeah okay nearly hurry up come on new ones yes okay thank you food are 32 and 34 33 thank you through the cheer and sorry just take them back to 35 28 item I syphilis counselors understanding what are the changes that have occurred now insurance policies that have resulted in a greater level of expenditure than budgeted for damages policy vecino increase in premiums here she also had additional premium increases and structured liability from memory I think also from some of the Queen 's costs moving forward mr. Fox are we expecting any other changes three mr. chair yes we are potentially we were looking at a cyber of the insurance policy in relation to ransomware and the like it has been considerable all councils at the moment throughout the region in terms of the ba place group and potentially once again comes back to it material damage the schedule changes are are there those that is a moving target every year under mentally so there will be some changes there always is okay are you expecting any material significant changes in the coming financial year not particularly no the cyber insurance policy for example would be into the city of a premium of about five to seven thousand dollars thank you okay I can plate you say yeah the dispute oh so this is my observations on the community staff for the pose emerged of the fingers which to every day on the coast for expansion would comprise three about to head that the the savings made on the purchasing commander data bits of pressing and obviously his role so so that because will be remembered Thank You councillor Williamson so any further questions because that completes the CEOs reform tourists and on page 3 ball 2 is a suggested resolution so carven movie please Thank You councillor Winston settlements see it council party or in favor all right Larry _"

    "text": "direction on sales process good afternoon are you sending them jeez nice to see and we back here again so we 'll take the agenda item is red i think you 've all read it a few times over the last couple years and it 's now 12 months since we originally delayed the sales process so it 's time to come back and visit it again okay and today we need to make the discern brick to essentially what 's being asked for because we said we 'd defer it for a year so it 's time to I guess make the call and in terms of whether we 're going to put it on and yeah okay so which council would like to lead the church guess for Harvey you know I ask is there any update on what 's happening around it with the land that used to be the taxi stand is there any I 've only got do you say so I 'd rather not repeat it in public oh yeah beneficial no no official app table mm-hmm councils Houston second point look for me I have no problem but I really struggled with the concept of doing urban planning which includes traffic management and car parking on an ad hoc basis for me I have not seen long-term strategies or traffic management plans for the city which includes tongariro street nor do I have ever seen any strategies or master plan for our long-term and parking requirements and so I 'm from dead basis I struggle to to let go yet another 27 car packs until I know and I 'm satisfied that we are adequately planning for that in an urban urban planning type of scenario thank you consider the chair I would I 'm signal and support units comments on this matter I am NOT opposed to selling strategic assets to pay down debt however this is just solely focused on it from that point of view I would like to have a wider discussion and to have a review of our wider urban management plan in terms of parking etc this is also a very sensitive high-profile site and yes we do need to do something about it at some stage don 't think is right and we have mixed views out there in the community on this matter and I would just like some time to have some more discussions about that before we make a final decision part of the resolution to come back to it and 12 months time was to review market conditions and see whether it was appropriate to sell I 'm not sure that 's changed either at this point so I would support you know I would like to see it deferred and having a wider discussion so I think basically to clarify why we 're here we can only bring forward what what we were directed to previously the original decision did go into the parking requirements there was quite an extensive parking study done to show where parking was needed there was times done those timings the site was visited multiple times a day along with all the other car parks so there was a considerable amount of work done on the parking permits now time has rolled on and you know since then and and sis identified the walkway which in there regardless you couldn 't have the car park and the walkway without sacrificing some if not all but and certainly from our point of view as officers we can only bring back what we were what we were asked to bring back and that was to either defer or or sell now and there 's a process that to go through if that 's not the options for Council obviously yeah and so very uh yeah this was a key element of the review of the town center what did we call that document sis sis passes and yeah there was a lot of discussion around the loss of car parts of that particular stage but it was at that particular time put forward as an idea a strong idea within that document I I just feel that we have a really large corp are only 500 meters away the street in my opinion is is could look a lot better with with a development and walkway connecting through to Robert 's tree if we don 't make the decision today we are going to have to spend money so for me we 've we 've got a strategic direction on our financial statements that we want to reduce debt and and I would be in favor of the resolution a XP cancer cousins here I 'm probably a different thought to counsel the heckling I we have a website oversupply buildings in town as it as full retail I understand that it 's an 18 hospitality street and there could be severed bandages today I would like to see it removed off the cell list all together and we just Park it up and we do something with it because as councillor Dolan says some it needs to be done with that site I think it 's a strategic asset that 's going to be a benefit to this community in the future long into the future and the market is certainly heating up now and topol with property sales values haven 't yet come back in as councillor jolons also said and that 's been confirmed by councillor Harvey values have an increase I think at least it should be another five years before we look at it on the interim we fix it up that 's a bit of an eyesore at the moment so i would i would recommend a different resolution we meet today and it is removed from the lesson we redress it in five years time or something to that effect okay anyone else if she just want I 'm those next on the back then I see any sorry Mac I 'm gonna put you on the spot here just some regarding castle criticism Kristen doute the planning situation we would to do you know did you go into the car park anything prior to the decision to make oh Jesus Elvis sell this piece of land what was the discussion regarding Lee where is the discussion regarding the packing all that sort of thing at that stage the painting the study standing I 'm sure you could well imagine car parking was a pretty hot topic when we were talking about the town centre and planning for the next 20 years we speak a huge amount of time looking over historical car parking issues we 've done a number of surveys during the actual development of the structure plan itself all of that work identified that we had an overabundance of car parking excuse me I 'm given that is has been notably having had substantial growth in the last five years I unbelievers any evidence that would suggest that that car parking situation has changed dramatically in which case are I think I can sit here and say with a high degree of confidence there is still ample car parking within the town center from memory i think it was about eighty percent was the highest we reached as far as car park enoch occupancy when we did the study and that was for a brief period on the busiest day of the week on honor on average it was less than it was dramatically less than eighty percent occupancy shall qualify though if you wish to park outside the shop that you are going to there may well be our car parking problem in Talpiot just before or cancer cousins ostrosky well next year we don 't need yeah just an answer to that is that that is at it from the status quo from the position of status quo we know from past historical facts like a the original commercial industrial structure plan there were significant plans to alter the traffic flow in the city take if you were to take that into consideration and into the equation your amount of car parking facilities would also dramatically change both from preserve from location as well as availability point of view i wreck back from a location perspective yes from an overhaul of car parking i 'd suggest no you 're quite right in that the previous town center stretch plan and our current policy document the commercial industrial structure plan both talked about the potential to reroute car parking along to developing a street and n on despair road and what that does is it frees up tongariro street for redevelopment opportunities photographer oyster is a big street with a lot of capacity for additional car parking one of the key messages that came through that structure plan which is your adopted policy was that car parking should be treated as a pull so if we 've the day we 've got a number of big on-site carts I off-site car parking spaces and we have a large like hundreds and hundreds of on-street car parks some of which your time restricted but a lot of which are not time restricted that provides you a pool of car park and the idea is that over time you manage that pull now the environment court evidence that was presented by an economist and a retail distribution expert on behalf of counsel said that we our town does not facing massive commercial growth in terms of floor area and as a result our transport expert are also appeared said that we have sufficient car parking well into the future and the flexibility with our three large off-site car parks to be able to manage that over time particularly when you couple that with the significant amount of on-street car parking that we 've got okay thanks to cancer cousins in cancer Harvey you 've got car parks that are worth average money and you got car parks that are worth a considerable amount of money as a different entity further out bet people are likely to use this and keep the ones that you know our well picturised they don 't make sense I should probably qualify them I 'm not a property experis that 's what this guy 's never have the mobility point of view for those who are her old people who are in the cars you were asking him to travel 500 meters to us is nothing but the people is aren 't dead carfax I wouldn 't even like I guess I guess a couple of things in response to that first of all I think the two photostream compacts probably more like 200 meters and I think 500 meters will take you a long way and secondly you 've still got a massive on street car parks sitting in their block between tongariro street and ruapehu street if you will can about people with push tears if you consumed about people with mobility issues the new head the ability as the council to identify more of those car parks specifically for those people so fit young people such as ourselves have the opportunity photo street car park for the utilize in what manner as in its not sitting there 100 BC where 's ism it 's flash identified it it very really gets above about 75% father okay that 's all very well back tonight Italy is um okay yeah so I I 'm definitely some of you too Bennett and and Zayn and Roseanne I I think if somebody was coming to us with a wonderful concept plan for that street with something fabulous for several of those sites then that would be different but I think to sell it ad hoc just a piece here and a piece there to me doesn 't make sense and in the market certainly isn 't it a level at the moment where we 're going to get huge money it 's it 's not going to fly out the door at the moment yes it 's a bit better but it 's not going to be you know it 's not going to be great at the moment and we do have plenty of commercial space at the moment that 's not being utilized where we have bars and restaurants all vying for business and we certainly don 't want to take car parks away from them I don 't think that is very utilized that car park I see it being very utilized and fact when one does pop out it 's usually hard to find a space even in there so I 'm definitely not keen to do anything about it at the moment I 'd like to defer it probably for a year and so let 's see if you know the interest comes out from the surrounding areas and that 's something a bit different that may come out of the woodwork I 'd be keen to know if that was going to happen just on that the fair thing we cannot defer it is that what 's the process here so I i would suggest that these a few shoes in terms of how long and we look at any deferral and it possibly needs another and report potentially there 's stuff in here that we can canvass with in there the issue is really regarding our intent with we headed to feral until for 12 months as part of that this was included in our projected sales targets and things like that so there 's a few issues regarding that that we 'd need to I guess flesh out in terms of if you 're looking at one or five years like you mentioned before anything like that starts to get into re-evaluation territory as far as i can see you under the LGA so just to be so what 's what 's liable 12 months would keep it within the long-term plan because it just means it 's Johnny swaps it from one year 's figures to another year 's figures so that 's as far as I think your question was around the process and whether we whether we can as far as love Goodman hoax concerned yeah and Kenya golds but he 's probably a better the other element that I guess comes into it is the costs of effort in terms of any further deferral is the indicative cost that we talked about previously that we would all bearing so we have to have date or time frame regarding any deferral would be I be cautious about doing it I think is probably the best way to explain it to you yeah yeah there we go Rob to fill as a possible or is it not you 're on camera here on the lawyer actually depends on is what are you deferring it too if you defer for another year just to have exactly the same debate then candle if you if you deferred it for a year and said we will sell it we make a decision now to sell it within the year in you can do because the problem is you get to another year and you continue to defer one of the things you gave you you 're going to have to do if you decide to do that you are but one of the things you can do is rewrite your sis for instance here today so what you have to do under section 80 of the act of the LGA if you are going to not comply with your own policies we have to the relevant moment system 80 identify that you are not going to comply with your own policy why you not apply with it and are you going to review the policy that you decided not so that 's why give a same barrel is an option we probably really need to come back for you with more advice about those issues why might you be normal why you might not be displaying your own policy and are you going to review the system take this out of the development out I I for one would like to fully understand why if we didn 't sell it we would be not confer and not complying with this policy when the whole process is about maximizing the potential of of our open center I 'm a little bit lost on that so i wouldn 't mind having a further discussion about those implications and understanding we were at I mean I 'm very much for these guys car parking is a discussion but it 's also about maximizing the potential to enhance our in a city in a township and this is one of our last it on the market and let it go for another couple of offices it doesn 't feel right because of the council 's already ate yo peeps logo rhiannon let 's cut to the chase I everyone selatan he doesn 't good Rosina son no I mean I 'd set on the same I 'd sell it with the right reasons at the right time but not right now doesn 't matter sort of thing boo boo buddies the ETA it 's not even here let 's step over one progress through snow lovers and we don 't know top case is gone all those buildings are here what does the shambles I just so sandals that 's right it 's a bloody shambles December 's all right that 's right why not building hmm I 'm saying okay shall we can I just offer some advice here because it sounds to me as though there 's a lack of understanding of what 's especially is and it 's a document that took seven years to write and get through the courts to implement so I think it 's rather in disagreement with a policy that is incredibly important so as a suggestion how about we take this paper and let it lie that we defer it on potential until the next council meeting and in between then we have a workshop that actually briefs everybody what 's this is all about the discussions that happened regarding suspe and then we can perhaps debate some of these other peripheral issues in a bit more detail to get some knowledge and comfort around the room as to why we actually really are would that be an acceptable solution it 's were because if you test your own district plan and you drive it home through it yourself it means the only potential future developer can use that as a course of action in the courts to drive other holes through your district them so we just need to be completely sure that we 're not doing that by making a decision on the fly because I don 't actually have an answer for you at this point in time mr. what the implication would actually be and I think it 's make sure we do thoroughly understand that would that be fair from your perspective neck and rub do yeah and I 'm just offering some caution here in terms of what we 're doing right there 's also an opportunity to provide because we went through so many processes to get to the certain know the last time around there 's a lot of information for example the car parking studies and things like that I can can bring you back the statistics around those types of things which showed what the use of that particular car park was and what it compared lights for the others so that might add some comfort in terms of the more recent studies that we 've done going forward to just throw that in the Mexican so it 's a completely unfair question of staff however what I would say is if you move that space as a space the way it is urban design principles tell you that you 're making a mistake so that 's all I will say on the matter well it 's let 's defer and have that sell on the facts that are in this paper is not enough here to make an informed decision so perfectly happy to see you you 'll know soon no no various juice tea soda fear and heaven worked up about it yes they will is that the question is rob 's edition okay Rob seduced you what made before Tuesday good luck _"

    "text": "item 4 thank you play and take us through this report this report is basically and we spoke about the statement of intent receipt of those in the last council meeting this report has an opportunity for feedback to be given to the council control organizations on those statements of intent and council officers have reviewed them as you 'll see in the appendices there are some feedback that has come on a couple of C cos there was also a workshop how the destination great baked hopeful that councils are invited for that feedback to be given directly to the CCO and really today as an opportunity for us to discuss those statements of intent after receiving them and to either basically look at the feedback that 's been given by officers add to those which analyzes is elected members desire ok thank you k so I think the first one is on page four therefore was probably some suggestion of inclusion and so it 's why the councillors agree to to that suggestion of the officers yep so that 's just basically my chemical thing in order to that they would like to include there you just on the first one we take it in bulk well I was just going to give their counselors the opportunity to comment on the offices recommendations and then we 'll go to the resolution and the derma support counseling but it though and as you can see on some of them this council is satisfied with a feedback page for bar a to the surfer the suggestions or two to amend so just river to that as you mentioned the less we have some commentary and we 're satisfied with the populace statement intent and pets if we work through them and originally if you 've got any feedback with him look at that okay so bra place we 're satisfied with from an officer 's perspective is there any other additional permit the airport authority were also satisfied with from officers expected destination great lake toprol so we 're looking at full bar seven now so there has been some feedback given which was given a network shop and also from officers so the first bed is around a couple been recommended some tightening up around the performance measurement there 's also some commentary that 's come through from audit New Zealand as you can see there that we 've suggested that they apply that they hadn 't applied they also some some minor things around their compliance and disclosures section is there any additional feedback that elected members would like to improvise okay if not we 're going back to the mountain for the first page or just just on the last one sorry and just touch also with the eleventh government funding that 's the final checkpoint 20 sorry there 's no feedback there 's no food just took the net one for my education someone able to explain how it actually works and local government funding agency is that castle Valkyrie yep sorry counsel I wasn 't each other something and your GF a is a operates effectively like indeed as a collective if you like a funk New Zealand councils that are shareholders it and so it 's through the power of that collective and the ability to buy when larger sons both onshore and offshore of interesting for councils in New Zealand currently there 's thirty percent of the investors from offshore and it 's that 's been growing steadily and with the you know interest rates that you seen overseas your big hedge funds and that are chasing obviously in a yield they can get globally and it 's a very good investment for them so so mechanically how it works is instead of going to a bank or going to the market when we go to orgy of Fame so we have a funding requirement of X they source the funds force and pass it through to us I think it was the chairman in that regard to think the financial show we have two million to put my million invested at the moment set with it III sorry the in the local government so so yeah there 's a couple of things here that because of the structure of the entity every time that we borrow we have to invest in what are called boiler notes and that 's just it 's tied up with the structure of the entity and also these things called bio a note Sophie I can 't remember the exact ratio but i think it 's 425 million dollars we have to invest 400,000 of what 's called boiler notes so so you end up having debt on the side and a little bit of investment on the other league so the two million would mean quite a bit of bowery and now it 's just needed off what you borrow so if you 're borrowing 25 million basically you 'll receive back 24 million six hundred I 'm trying to get the grips to that if I put a dollar into a bank in an interest it 's going to be less than yet then what you would pay to come into the back to borrow my dollar I just can 't work out how that works to our advantage even though we 're able to borrow cheaper than the market the boiler no sooner do an interest I 'm still confused but but better than a dozen runs of a complex subject maybe it 's better if we have a one-on-one on a counselor in to do that thank you we 'll do that ok councilman joe runs through the chair question for Chloe um so in terms of next steps these ccos will finalize the documents in regard to request we 've made of shareholders particularly in regard to DG LT if they don 't take on board the our suggestions what happens from there because I know there are some reasonably significant ones in DT LT and the report was made the report was left it was ever seated on the team in March they actually seems a draft on the third of March but decided to put another one in following up and to lead into that meeting on the 18th so it is that is out of the legislative timeframes the feedback that we give them my understanding is that they can choose whether they take that feedback on board or not if you are then unhappy with the resultant statement of intent you can actually then go back to them and request again for changes to be further made to that and that 's an amendment to the statement of council controlled organization you can start going down those lines of actually being the shareholder and and given that you appoint the board thank you there are so this suggests that resolution is five CCS there are listed down when to the five will take it as a boat right recommendation can sometimes just a point of clarity a couple of the resolutions such as the one for the Talpiot Airport Authority council satisfied with the bulk of the draft yes sir I some feedback to be sent we don 't actually send any feedback to them a partner in the fact we 're satisfied so just to be technically correct we should have I think that 's a field solution and and you could rework that absolutely we will still be sending a litter of you know procedure from the council while acknowledging up to you but i guess the implication is they 've seen some amends we require and in particular with such as the Talpiot airport authority we 're not requesting anything as opposed to something like DG LT where we are making some specific perhaps if statement of intent Alicia roof there 's different degrees of feedback across this emotional issue of confirmation perhaps okay yeah so council is satisfied with the statement of intent with leisure of confirmation to be sent to less and so if we apply that to the others usual so that would go through tu Toa to know plenty yep they are not to last about painting and then also 32 LG FA so those three would be amended what that effect so with that moment looking for a mover and a seconder for this resolution plates Thank You Cassius dude how 's the pork or in favour point and 50 this item is basically sort around endorsement for a submission that we made to the Bay of Plenty long-term plan now obviously we are not a district that sits within the bay of plenty region but it was officers deemed it appropriate to provide a some commentary particularly around the economic development aspect in the consultation document as you can see there the consultation point was proposing to decrease funding and not not add any more funding and economic development the topo district council and enterprise ground leto people are volunteering members off so we I know that they spoke to council as part of the hearings last week and we very much see the value of the bad connections in terms of what it 's able to do for our region so Russia submission to this effect so I 'll take the rest of the Iceman 's region there 's any questions for German through the chair Chloe heareth the Bay of Plenty heard their submissions yet you stay here they have okay all right so this was a just a record for just tuition we didn 't ask to be heard on it I 'd also note that enterprise great lake talk will also put a submission and to say no they did not sure just a question okay thank you today I just would like to know in five bar one why this assumption has been made and you go down to the word officers on the side and it 's a different print that starts off we ask that you do not limit new funding can proximo we believe this cut will have proportionally far greater impact on economic development in our wider region why 's that been said and because from an officer 's perspective we do see significant value that comes out of the bay of connections and for a thousand dollar investment for the region to invest in economic development the quantum of opportunity that comes out of those groups as fun and far greater than that I can 't give you exactly what the economic impact assessment of that particular groupers but from the activities that have been happening it 's a significant amount of benefit to that region to that regional this region what to that region but also us because we are a take on at the bottom what then are those benefits and so we can break through having some of the big ones and the fact that we talk as united voice you know we as a collective bad connections has been invited to speak to the caucuses of both our national in the Labour Party 's also New Zealand first so you have a stronger front when member of bad connections we are party to that there are various industry groups that are involved been created from the Bay of connections such as a forest reward action group the aquaculture group and these groups are looking at pushing investment forward and having those groups look at regional economic development projects including some that we have going on here as significant benefit we currently have an investor who 's looking at a net culture project in total and that has come directly off our relationship with the pay of connections and the groups that are being formed so mr. Cheevers it 's been stated in the beatsie we won 't be voluntary any longer will be members will always have to be voluntary member because we are not part of the regional the region we are the why cut also we are technically also part of the why Couture economic development strategy as well the reason that we choose to do both is because out towards the bay we have significant economic benefit and it 's a natural line for us to follow in terms of that that the Tier one last question chlorine I 'm sort of picking your brains here so you may not have the answer to that one just as a matter of interest the Bay of Plenty District Council how much do they spend on economic development you know plenty regional council need to do I understand it 's over over a six-figure sum that is put into by of connections no percentage-wise 100,000 so a million dollars sorry seven figures over a million dollars that gets put into an to Bay of connections and economic development activity and also have their regional investment fund which is would you know the size of their friend off the top of your head but it 's a very sizeable fund of which 18 million was distributed or tagging heralded for distribution last last year yeah and we will definitely seen investment from there to come into the topo district so absolutely involvement in their chest as so to support my understanding though their their draft plan is looking at saving about a hundred thousand dollars in their area over a 67 million cost okay all 's a suggested resolution there the council endorses a submission from the draft by if plenty regional councils long term plan so I 'll the mayor in a second to please we thank you cash the potty council presidents thinking bowling toilet I carried _"

    "text": "item number Leo at night well museum china of mural for attendance good afternoon of a cat I game counselors so this item no doubt you will have read um basically what this is about there 's an opportunity for us to discuss whether we are going to put into the muse and China mural forum and such chamber and watch this has come just to give you a bit of background and then we can go to questions and the new zealandtown real form was established by local government New Zealand along with the Chinese People 's Association for friendships with foreign countries and last year and this was off the back of ministry photographers indeed Inc initiative which is looking at improving our collaboration is the country working together and the China strategy which is to increase our relationships well with China and to build towards your increasing our GDP and growing our exports to the Chinese market and so what 's we kind of had a watching brief of us weren 't involved in the original program that came around the core core cities were involved in the Ambassador when the Tong who came to topple to bring the Vice Minister for education and we had a conversation with him and he requested that we look to attend this forum given our level of investment in relationship with China and to build those relationships and so basically what this paper is to looking at is whether we would like to attend the forum and to build the relationship further and potentially also while we 're up there again visit sue Joe and shashi to continue to build those relationships that are very strong at the moment and are flourishing so I 'll take any questions from there ok any questions or crazy answer because I speak to the comments if I may it seems to me to be illogical not to send the mayor over there having already spent a substantial amount of time money resources and having build personal as well as working relationships with their with the Chinese and we have just recently witnessed the success of our recent visit the mayor and myself we 're a local businessmen is sending a shipment of of discussions with other local businesses businesses who are keen to follow that at that and track down further down dope down the road we also know that dad there are there 's potential for at least a thousand Chinese businessmen to come over here which what well as far as I 'm concerned can only be off an economic boost for our economy and for the sake of five thousand dollars and I think it 's a no-brainer on as far as I 'm concerned and the sooner he goes to better answer your worship biggie okay thanks cancers Chris tusky any other question I would just like an unjust oh sorry can 't segment he said it 'll I 'm through the change thank you you worship can you please tell me what are the tangible benefits we will get as a district from this trip so from this specific to the stormy relationship and China on this trip okay so i think that the big thing i 'd say m which i think i 've mentioned and chambers before about relationships with China is that it 's all 's essentially trust end in friendship and a relationship and it goes both ways so it 's a it 's an opportunity for you to build that relationship and build on that credibility so we have a lot of investment in our region from China and is cancelled I knew I was going to screw that up I mentioned we know we we have a lot of opportunities that are opening up for our businesses sending product to China and we already have a number of businesses who are so building on that relationship is important you know we are we 've just you know I 've been I think we 're in the top five for um you know in words investment for New Zealand you know that 's pretty significant so we need to be seen to be building this relationship the more that we can do to build the credibility of our district and China the more opportunity that we will have so that 's from one side the other thing I would would say is that and by attending this and you know we will be to attend the forum as well this is obviously the Chinese need to sign this off but once we have signed off that we will be attending they will then get invited that increases our level of relationship end and potential partnership with with those areas and I think the other thing to say is what you know we we have a number of investments that have come from China that we are building on at moment in that we are continuing to progress so these kinds of visits to foster that and there is one in particular that we wanting to foster that would be significantly benefited from this trip that due to confidentiality I can 't speak about other chambers right now but is that related directly to this trip which has been organized by the forum or is that something that 's in conjunction with other words that we 're doing it would be a springboard so it will be done in conjunction but a teaming this I 'm like I say we will then make the opportunity to be able to foster these at the same of indeed inc with the new zealand government again builds a credibility all right thank you we have a questions or queries castle park it 's just after being able to attend and the local government new zealand conference last week in russia Roma take my colleagues for the opportunity and I attended a master class on migration economic development etc that talked about sister city relationships and how those should be used to leverage economic development opportunities it also talked about um so the constant innovation and big outward facing and connectors and that once you get that momentum with relationships you should keep their in keep focused and head constant efficacy for those because if there 's central government heaven issue dish they they engage with migrants they keep them here that then the balls dropped and I i believe and he loves sure you to be a part of these forms which are and of the local government needs will and sort of umbrella as well it gives us greater sort of credibility and two particular projects that you were just talking about which and yet so are quite happily and I 'm really look forward though and it 's canceled John Cena about the tangible outcomes at what not that those are we need to see those in need to keep on top of whatever happens they 're moving through it i think that the amount of money because i understand the sister city budget but was about 20 k I think it 's 15 days but I just think that amount of investment for what could happen for the big picture I 'm here for the big picture and I know that guy on an international trip right there that 's not all nice flights and airport lounges and whatnot you the ground running whip mate for the whole 30 days you owe me about any spectacular anything so does had brick and and yeah I 'm happy to move the suggested resolution ok thanks counselor cousins is five and a half hours of reason on day one we may be done point want it to go no I don 't_''_533.06 I don 't_''_533.54 I don 't_''_534.32 I believe in connectivity including relationships but here economy is reduced by thirty eight percent in the last two months I think it is that 's what that 's quite sorry cui consumer yeah quite alarming yeah it 's interesting talk about what the Chinese government has done to prevent that reducing further which is credibly interesting you out there well I love dis Singapore for a year I understand a Chinese culture I understand what you talk about face to face and building relationships but I don 't think this is one for our level I think it 's none of the next people above us okay so it 's through the chief if we agree collectively to do this I would please ask that we get a detailed report after it that is not just a download of what China has been up to on the Internet to be frank I want to see what out I want to see a list of key objectives for going and I want to see results I want to see a

Ed 's working with me to help support that event happen so yeah I think it 's going to be the 23rd of September but there were some more details coming great he 's the minister at the moment you been north there are meglar Maggie Barry oh she 's lovely yeah and the bug means coming to she used to live here hey are you okay counselor okay it 's customary for councils to do a rough and report following a 10am meeting which you know brake pads funds are being used for and I haven 't yet done mine but I see in their counselors weekly update all the presentations were media releases and everything were included as attachments councillor heckling Jones myself in you wish at real there and I 've got screeds emotion and quite happy if any counselors would like to catch up for a coffee and go through amia base stations and if things a desire for written reports i 'm quite happy to do that as well that as i said he 's there haven 't I haven they like a written report or was it good could I make the suggestion I mean most of the speaker 's notes are available what would probably be of interest to me personally would be we all attended our own master class on a particular topic like that the RMA master class I 'm more than happy just to write some key outtakes from that to share with you just a couple of paragraphs so that if that 's helpful hmm because if only I 'd done about some of your councils that I might involve was inundated the last couple of ways with stuff with regards to local government was doing my hidden I was mean to me to meet me pick out what I wanted to reread didn 't be the best presentations from Kevin Roberts yes sergeant sarchie your money dairy yeah I think that was the highlight of my day at the local body conference I think that was well worth traveling through on that particular day gave you a lot of encouragement and incentive to communicate with the community in in different ways of you ready to meet anytime cool cousins my members report there 's a goat on Guerrero 's got a little hot potato at the moment without trying to run a light to float the idea running at a road through the town center to rejuvenate the more I think it 's going to be rather cost prohibitive but end of the day the community wants it then we 're happy to support at Maggie I I 've spoken with mr.

    "text": "so I had no feedback this morning regarding the submission so I 'm assuming you 're happy with the submissions also thanks Janie any questions or Jane they 've been the case but I ever suggested move the pink against the cousins second about Castle Park all those in favor please say aye I inst carried item ten Vince 's reserves dogs committee Constitution change rating traffic Thank You Jane against will become rude um so yeah I 'll take the reporters route this came about because of the change to the traffic by law and we 're just tidying up a lot of back end stuff as a highlighter through the bile or we mentioned that we haven 't been very diligent and L making sure that you resolve all our lovely signs and markings out there on the roads so this is as a result of that initially it was going to be that you would your sales would have a standing and agenda item at every council meeting and we agreed that that wasn 't a handy way of proceeding so ever minted the where we were a word of caution I thought we should avoid adair creams in relation to this committee and future because if you have F rted there could be a rather unfortunate in title for the community over in a damn room so we still call this a food committee or every day there 's lobby called the freakin I wasn 't ending a tea in there ok good all right I think you can quite a known mr. chairman of the matter what the freed committees doing we could supersede Council and save a lot of money they give him a smart object to the gym and yeah any other quality comments it right I think you gotta move a place for that thank you can sir Donald signify counseling always a favor please say aye hoist item 11 240 Taylor Street direction on sales process do they come afternoon gross girls yeah okay so the reason why we bought this item through is just am in order to try and give you the opportunity in a bit of lead in time obviously last year we put night and which agreed to make sure that we meet that deadline in terms of those processes and putting it on the market if that 's what the indication is at the moment that 's why we 've kind of brought the item to get your vice direction is to help the feeds through that but we are conscious of the fact that due to the influence of the timing for their sales process that it is part of the long-term plan and in our budgets we 've indicated that it 's part of the next financial years income because if we can you boot the timeframes out it gets into next financial year and but if we make a neat we 're making the deferral that influences we nets likely to settle it may be something as part of the deliberations process for the LTP side of things that you would need to consider during that process so um with that in mind and probably got an amendment to option B for considering your new influence on the property sales targets and maintenance budgets set out via the long term plan deliberations process we you know it does seriously demo gia figures it can to influence what those words into yes thanks come from that bunch of the figure here I don 't end up with anything sorry John as if any movement on the properties next tutorial yes I and as far as we 're weird the two photos I never trust and offers the treaty settlements and no further along and having a decision either way as to what you know what 's going to be hitting with that lean so I love to better put a time frame on us and I 'm unfortunately can 't_''_252.06 of could be cutting within a month I 'm cousin within 10 years and and what that outcome may be it may get it to avatar and they go to someone else we just simply don 't know is it okay and somebody will just make a point of clarification when we 're doing the draft plan we did the first one we 're willing to do the second one and we were given appendix attachment three in total our long-term district strategy and to this attachment there was a three million drop and specific perspective property sales so do those sales still well they will because it 's in the long-term plan so effectively we 're looking at another million as a figure that would come off so we 'll end up with 4.5 rather than 5.5 with it I don 't know the exact numbers of the lines off by heart but next year so the 2015-16 year would be influenced by whatever we could get to a fairytale straight thank you okay counselor cousins what we 've been updating what happened with the injunction that was taken against Council it wasn 't a threat was it yeah so that was a few months ago we went through the last the last annual plan process remember whenever convocation gave the options you decided last June my months ago which is attached to this agenda item get a couple of options seller not sell you decided to sell but to defer up 12 months and so the option before you today is to either I think they did last year was we decided do this in the end if we decide not to cell count and then we were told that we had to put in it because we 're to go through the offer back process in the years time if we didn 't do it what we were told council decided not to sell so didn 't do it no we were in there with all the head to defer because of the we can offer it again to the public yeah well he was a loner sorry perfect yeah so through the cheer for you refer to page 11 by one it shows and the way down the page it shows you the resolution that you resolved in jun 2014 and say it so you resolve to defer the sale for a period of 12 month with pending further investigation and so at that time we gave you some advice which basically said if you decided not to sell you would basically have to go back to square one and a couple of things give farmers around consultation and the seek one rather applause around the alphabet process so this ability to have the flexibility to do what you 're doing there or any point in future considered kruszewski no thank you for worship but just I 'm carrying on from a counselor around cousin sir on 11 bar rate under the note the last sentence it says the not the owner of the site was the party who made the threat of legal action prior to the auction last year my-my question basically is one of courtesy and communication have we communicated with that particular party as to regard to our potential future plans we threw the deliberation sorry not through the through the notification last year we went out to the whole community we didn 't specifically go to that person oh and and as of this point we are to do whatever so I just missed the first part the question was a relation to the person who the who threaten the injunction was it your question well now not as to who buddy I 'm a point basically being is that whether we in fact should be going back to that person and and inform them on the market again and whether some pressure of my memory suits who correct me that that particular person all the accompany actually did submit on the in your plan last year the objection was about their perception that we haven 't how they call king of debate about it so hence one needed when towns for precisely that so we answered the question although our advice was that we don 't correct Lee but because with the council and the right to make sure with braces we went back out to everyone including the party without pre consultation it wasn 't issue regarding car parking as well don 't think so it was this point i think i think if we go back to living bar one with the original resolutions is that we further investigation the opportunity for journing property owners again we haven 't really done that yeah like why don 't we give that my suggestion bleed probably the ferret another six months are today and really go through that process will do know whether they 're actually going to but you know what what 's to happen with that side you know with the taxis are and that sort of thing we have had some discussions with them the nature of those conversations are confidential and this is in the public side right because of the context of what we 're dealing with yeah but um so in in regards to investigation and conversations their hair scream and with it particularly with their side property and and hasn 't because it has an atmosphere week when was the last time you took them so I as I alluded to before I spoke to them last week yeah knew that we had this meeting wanted to give you an update and their update to us was it 's it 's no further along no we can 't believe indication of what what made what the outcome may be okay cancer cousins yeah I suppose there 's more pressing consumer vehicle questioners there 's the counselors have desire to sell that piece of land or not really well I but you know we 're gonna need that for there just after mates yeah no we 're going know their ins for in it and why fools are selling but as council want to sell out those that 's the question el tercer resolver cancel this time by moving you worship the resolution that to a 92 photo street be taken off the property register at this time I would second that my I 'm a medium I mean I 'm just from the discussions we were just mentioning regarding deliberations and the fact that it 's part of that process and if you were looking to do something like that it 's probably appropriate to consider it as part of the LTP consultation in deliberations process rather than through this item so I 'm sorry that we 've put this in front of you and a little bit of it but that takes us back to a year ago where we decided that the council really just like with ourselves looks like we had this sincerity so just put ourselves into a quagmire that wrong complain because I think we can store me with a different resolution to sell property not to sell because I appreciate where back it confuses me somewhat because on one hand you put an agenda item in front of arts expecting us to make a decision but then on the other hand you 're basically saying it 's part and parcel of the long term wheel and consultation process which you 're asking us to Priam so please help me to understand and I was like five minutes ago yes we had we had a moment of actually desperations and we don 't want to print and put you in a position of not making a decision so if you put the same way little more put it on the market now and you 'd be in line with all your previous decisions and you wouldn 't be out of place with anything that you 've done today but if you make something different that has an influence on the ltp plan and danette something that you would need to consider what glue perhaps help here I think it might be prudent to defer this paper at this point in time and not actually go anywhere and then once we 've had can done bring this back to the July council meeting will still have three months of our sleeve exceptional you know I would support neck okay item two food thank you thanks for much I don 't number 1290 night just a couple of changes you wish up so on the fifteenth of April there 's been a request by local government is Eiland for a meeting with council 130 to 330

follow that you don 't make any any other appointments and the 28th before the workshop on the flood has a change there 's a week shopper closed workshop from 9 30 to 11 regarding Iron Men presenting cancel I think you emptier do you know when you might have an indication about the workshops on the Civic and whether it 's a half day full day or what up what a mun tail at the moment we have got nothing cedral for I just had a request from one of the counselors to Wednesday 's a difficult day or two to put the two counselors Wednesday 's quite a difficult day so so we keep that in mind again

Dennis Lewis good afternoon miss Lewis when you wish it they have a report here for the the tender for the upgrade of the much lower wastewater treatment plant and I guess with the contractor for a number of weeks the tender was received in May has taken us a little bit of time to finalize the pricing and the pricing is considerably above what we originally had in the budget I 'll take any questions Thank You mr. loose any questions or queries the mr. Luce answer cousins several um you know so I try to be on a curve moset but I said the US was going to seem that we will ever discharge 500 cubic meters of nitrogen into the lake under the new resource consent correct what are we doing presently because a cap on a reference of that it was the underlying reason as to why we 're doing this the current discharge standard for total nitrogen the 75 percentile is 35 milligrams per liter up to a maximum of 40 milligrams and the proposed and the new discharged consents were for the 90 90th percentile was 35 milligrams and the maximum kilograms per day was four and a half well we actually discharging now operating under the nuke and that we 've been operating under the are we currently meeting there yes we 're currently meeting it yes is it gay joke though what is it what is the difference though I 'm trying to gauge that what what is the sense of urgency to do to do this upgrade it because obviously this is something big we must be getting close to 500 are we all yeah the agency for the upgrade is that yes we are currently meeting up and consent conditions much you open like a number of the lakeshore settlements as subject through seasonal fluctuations during the summer period and during the summer period not this previous summer but the summer before we had some difficulties meeting our consent conditions because of those that summer run flux there 's been some objections made by various parties and we haven 't got the privilege of seeing what those objections were about and we were I feel a little bit unable to make a decision without seen those objections because one of them was a developer Steve Halladay who did the subdivision in the first place though strike even hold him but he 's through the because the the consent application has made to regional council we able to cite those will not even certainly get the information for you yeah I just want make sure communities rejection is some some members rejection I know if you actually had that understanding the wharf and make a decision on things i want to do this about it the objections were largely around landscaping of the plant for trees and odor because the developer still owns 26 section block which is subject to subdivision consent I think which they must be a reasoning why yeah I just like to have a handle on that this from my perspective Thank You Dennis ok kelsey johnson you worship I 'm mr. Lewis just a couple of quick questions from me where we act in the planning or in the prices for connecting the motto for residents to our town supply for potable water there is no current plan to connect anyone any further and residents in mojo better the reason I ask is that one of the conditions of the resource consent for the discharge to landers that connected yet we went through that process and this consent was issued and November 2013 and subsequent to that we would out to the community those down on the lakeshore and ask them whether they wanted to connect or not we went through that process and council made a decision I 'm not unique okay so in terms of the condition then for that resource consent we will have satisfied that requirement with WRC okay just that the last question goes goes back to the cost because there is a I guess what you call a materially significant difference from what you estimated to what 's before us today and can we just get an understanding of what 's driving those costs because there are other to light up to other line items that we 're looking at funding from and I just need to understand why and what the implications are for those other space hi Mary different than the cost as the original cost of 700,000 which was provided by one of our advisors was based on a concept design there was no detail to that concept and that original miss them it was too light and that that 's principally what it essentially they were proposing in the original concept designs were what we 've got seen through into the detailed designs just the estimates were too late so that would have been affected under the resource consent discussions for the o hein no no though does the concept design was done after we 've received the resource consent conditions that way we knew what we were needing to design for and just so just in terms of those other line items that the we are seeking to reallocate to fund us what are the implications these the follower Brewer is a proposed was a monitoring board that was under the original consent for the photo royal wastewater treatment plant the ground conditions the Euro such that water table is estimated to be somewhere in the order of 100 to 150 meters deep and it 's just not practical to put on a monitoring board to monitor groundwater because we can 't reach it and with acacia Bay that was an anticipation of Sudan consent requirements under at the stage we 've got every indication they 're all that will need to be doing at at acacia Bay is some upgrade to the underground so Kitsch fields which would free up them funding sure and I guess that 's partly a function of our growth projections and the demand it 's partly of growth predictions but it 's also negotiations with the Regional Council term to get some good outcomes for Council and the last the last question is around the number of people that put intenders you only had one and there is a comment there that um no one else really seemed interested can you elaborate as to why I 'm just trying to can do with that we did find will speak to a number of contractors they indicated they may or may not be interested it 's um through the stage I think that 's largely attributable to the market motor oppa despite being in a great place is not really central to any process engineering constructors if you like so it is a little bit out of the way and there 's moment Thank You mr. Lewis and through the cheer I can just left work dinner said about the financials this is one of those scenarios we come across when we have to do a budget so far in advance of the financial year we can only take what we 've got at that particular point of time even though it might be work in progress so at that particular point of time where we had was too high level draft on the external parties and you 're talking round about 16 by October last year when we had to come up with the initial figures for the long-term plan draft okay cancer kruszewski yeah thank you and thank you for those questions there two questions so I do overall all up costs will be two point two six four million dollars am I correct in saying it landfill 464 won the constructors would congregate was 1.46 and there 's a all up total cost you say here on six bar for under conclusions it will be 11.4 64 million for deconstruction and then an additional funding for approximately 800,000 which and correctly have 700,000 currently in the budget is seeking 800 additionals that would give us a total of 1.5 million so a lot cost of the project 1.4 1.5 okay and the last question therefore is will we be revising our asset management plan on on those figures because the asset management plan that I would I saw would not have had figures indeed the SF management plan that you saw would have been the 2015 version this is funding that was allocated and the 1415 year so it wouldn 't now appear in the asset management plan thank you sorry Ted one last question of her male counterpart mistake sorry and yes think you 've just Justin and with the conclusion that an additional funding of 800 k physical upgrade works as well as consultants and electrical was associated with and the resource consent conditions it talks about lakeshore monitoring planes that are like those included in the 800 k know that that 's included and the other monitor objects monitoring budgets right okay thank you thank you Joe Johnson my question was very similar to councillor parks do the monitoring that 's required it 's around this new plant okay thank you okie dokie counts for having um I tended to adjust hinder tend to agree with saying that we may need to get some more information about you know just the background of it and perhaps we should look at just gathering some more information and retain during how urgent is this as we face the danger over the coming summer that if we haven 't implemented the upgrade then potentially we don 't comply with their consumers you raise the risk that you retain though that you may or may not got it get any more tenders and you may or may not get a cheaper price Dennis you mentioned the main basis of the objections were around landscaping and mitigation type it was mitigation of landscaping and odor was that address through the regional council process or that was sweeter than Dickensian conditions okay so you 're confident that you 're confident that those those those issues inside of the cost and the upgrade is for odor control yeah it just am with the acacia babe what 's where treatment plant and then these are in the 14-15 my license for a year 1415 I think a kosher by okay isn 't this year 's right so if we if this was to go here in Acacia Bay was de feared it would then be in a minute to our long-term plan no or will then what happens with the Acacia Bay wastewater treatment plant fish as almost signed off ltp in the first financial year what happens to that project because I really just can 't interfere buy pot of money when it 's not actually for the novel under the actual project will still to some extent be implemented as just a matter of wind so it might move from one year to the next type of thing but there 's just a adjustment will then your annual plans it 's not seen living it enough to go out and do a change to your long-term plan I understand it but I 'm just with the way we do want to employees and mixed you we don 't actually have it in this project helped it sort of faithful only duration heaven and your plan it 's just that we don 't have to go out and consult unless it 's of a significant difference to the long-term plan then we have to keep moving lesson until the money serve well and until the resource can seem to signed off by the regional council and the end so their resource consents have taken five or six years to come through sorry the budget has and then had to keep rolling things so it 's one of those unfortunate examples of being able to take for a date great okay thank you okay you have a questions on queries of Dennis dinner one tinder oh you just general coming out I 'd like to pretend oh that 's just not not just was not was saying a little boogie of Dan dinosaur the team has done I just think it 's prudent government to drive through the chair the only issue is probability of reaching resource consent over the summer period because the timing to re-tender and then get the teams are approved done before the summer what they do to us what 's the big occasion we 're attended probably looking at a month for the tender process kicking off say next week site of the the end of August tenders close Tina 's would be considered by counsel and September allowing a couple of weeks to engage and do the preliminary routes that it be the mid to late October when the contract kicked off it 's probably about a three-month contract so it 's got to sort of October through to endure January possibly so my question was ones repercussions from reasonable counsel if we don 't reach our resource can see it what are they going to do to us havin us mr. Quilp refines fifty thousand dollars per bridge with WI out for resource and so very order I 'm whether they would do that and I don 't yeah that 's why I for sure whether that 's the risk that you were trying to point out to anyone that we 've already been warned once which is why we 're in this situation so we 've process of getting the resource consent to correct the issue we 've tended to correct the issue if we ignore that opportunity then we heighten the risk of prosecution for Brett for any future breaches that 's what you 're saying isn 't it yep they 've already been warned can we I don 't know if we can official morning have we been so long been given the official role in the mountain we 've just been told that we have breached sorry but so we have actually discharged more than 50 carries into the later the breach is more relate to odor okay which is probably not gonna stand back by that spray poor Council Planning allowing the sub-divisional right next order of poop on soda speakers there really that that 's historical I still would like to see at the theater to re-tender take thing okay all right we 're going to suggested resolution the FM cancer Cousins has suggested that we defer it is he any support for that or doesn 't do we have the opportunity to go back to this tenderer to see if process over the last couple of months and I 'm tender price has been reduced by about a 100,000 and that 's more about trying to do things smarter than rather than cutting the bottom line so to speak okay all right I 'm through the chair would support counselor cousins on on this side I appreciate and understand the need to meet our resource consents and we have a process and a path that we 're going down to do that it 's just that these difference in what was budgeted and I understand what you 're saying mr. Louis but it is significant it 's eight hundred thousand dollars and I think we just need to since check that and I would be more comfortable if we deferred it to just check Andrey tender please okay thank you all right and suggested resolution that you do I have a movie for that moved by Councillor cruisers Christos key seconded by number do we have a seconder for that resolution okay I appear to be a seconder so um mr. Lewis we will perhaps to him what we do of that resolution lapses an abscess or what you call for a resolution okay so does the wood we have out a new resolution that we were the words around that ree tender yep that this gender is not accepted is not accepted and the staff are instructed to reach under okay the smoked yep thinking about cancer Jones all those in favor please say aye those against resolution is carried thank you all right sorry item number soon receipt of final I 'll okay do not go tell Carter okay fine it blends okay receive a final segment of a team documents from council controlled organizations which you have an attachment hear what you 've got them all on there yes oh and I won 't go through and everything word by word and I 'll take the item as weed and the attached final statement of intent again this is a relatively mechanical item for council to receipt now these final statement of intent and your notes that there has been some changes made to the statements of a tent off the back of council feedback to the to note and less as made some changes and edit in there around the addition of proportion of accumulated profits section and Wendy GRT as you 'll see has made a number of changes and the we 've included the agenda item that DJ LT put up to the above that dome includes to a merger put up to the abroad which outlined the sales changes the changes that council recommended additional changes that have been made changes that whatever have recommended and what they have chosen to do so that you have that context rather than having to you know computer I think we 've had that conversation in the past that actually makes it a lot easier if you have that context of the changes that are made and so take any questions otherwise we can okay thank you clay any questions cancer kruszewski just one thank you and in particular in regards to dld glt i see no know where that i can see where how we treat intellectual property imagine that intellectually OT would be significant yes and and I don 't have the trust deed it 's included in their trusted or the ownership sonogram because I 've just been working on it but I can 't how do we sing solo so I could check through those documents to make sure that regardless it should be included in our contract for service which is with destination electoral because obviously we as the major shareholder our owner of their intellectual property so yep whole note and i 'll let you know about that thank you okay cancer cousins just so just some common treat um we go I just I had a change of guard with with some various big like sleeves here Damien 's here and I want to say that I 'm loving the change from our community 's perspective and I 've really buy into the whole DGL tea and events kind of thing now I know if John body was here be having a holla tech question I 'm here now really impressive so all that I 'm sure that feedback is passed on to the detail to board and obviously there 's some family that will make sure it goes just collapse and Russia some board making its as well also all right okay thanks claim ham thank you for putting authorized to give her an technology i 'm damian and steve down the back there t from those various organizations so and we have a suggested recommend a recommended resolution there that we received the statements of intent if I clever move please cancer cousins thank you seeking to break a slow clean all those in favor please say aye is against Kerry _"

carried boy title number to remove these on own block and any matters are rising from these minutes you had one council cousins to about 22 I here for ice to concerns mean without the patient I 've associate mr. green is entitled I know obviously didn 't make a meal or point fingers reading but I do get worried times out if we question the paper that we have a right to push the paper especially when we feel faster ability and counselors stewarts backing out on that chaplains their papers just want to note that paper wasn 't they have a better day for the mvd just it was a para guards issues the paper was provided to counsel at the community called nemesis made a decision on there were some facts are incorrect others would point so it was razor because both know facts with being wicked incorrectly start with if they would but both counselors human life standby better so that 's excellent in here what about the view of the community boarded the the was the view of the whole committee did that to give text from the day or you need to be be bogus really obviously for a resolution yeah but the end result doesn 't justify the delivery I think what I counselor cousins is referring to as in the paper it said that the garage owner had complied when staff had approached him about where they were parking and that is true he did but only for short time they had to keep going back and I 'm getting to keep comply and I know for a fact that when I Drive past if staff of themI he has come and then he slips back again I think that 's that 's what counselor cousin from German the elder is committed to berate there was the Christian at their command immediate in regards of annual leave etc the minutes indicator that management procedures in place to reduce individual leave balances and just wondering what they are what has actually been done it maybe repeat of what we heard barges can 't remember maybe to see I might be able to UM yeah well as a matter of routine remember to staff leave and we if staff live gets out of control we have a management plan in place with those individual staff members to relieve within acceptable limits okay you can tell us what the penis is that part of the columns are different for each individual surfman by Nikki any other Mills Rosen the case but I 've removed for those limits you receive thanks thank you can see Stuart singing by counsel her clean all those in favor please say aye against Kerry item number three chief executive report so sorry bishop I apologize really type of community board meeting which I attended in during the other day just like to say how be taken to the community board conference this year in regards of the best practice award it 's one of the most perfect professionally put together documents that I 've seen I was sure the turing community would well annette and congratulations to staff for doing it thank you John I know the ad copy be available to anyone that mate I 've got one in the venue and once when in my office okay I don 't feel there are three chief executives report thinking rucha through the chair I 'd like to take version was read this corner for work for those guns with the plenty happening since the Christmas break there 's a lot of goodies in there but so happy to take questions Thank You mr. Loomis council kruszewski yeah I have one I 'm first at the first one really is some big things to you and your staff for actually getting the reports out and two or three days earlier than we used to have in the past and when it when they 're particularly large agendas it 's very very useful to have very much for that and if he can keep that up the would be greatly appreciated and and we are with just a commenting on the first few pages or whatever here and the school to page added we could hurt the other pointed out like the race is was underwater new water treatment plant accounts of a body and myself attended a meeting there on Friday afternoon which was rather heated and passionate of times and as a result of some of the comments made our wonder whether we could entertain the thought of taking the this particular item out of the long-term plan and addressing it on a separate issue and a different timeline through the through the chair I think because of the land by the long-term plan is structured we can do it with the writer hungry issue of a separate timeline as we are dealing with all the water issues on a separate timeline the issue with water honey in the long term planners mayor and the funding do we allow the funding to a known planet recommendation during hearings and then right off your in there but also to inform you and to request your permission to continue with that consultation exercise with the white honey community so that when we reach a particular conclusion we can then make a decision on the funding but it is in the plan if we need it so just for clarification then do we need to make a resolution then extracting that particular part of the long-term plane and no thank you human just on that matter while I was there I had not the intention of going to them meet him because I didn 't know it was on i believe it was to be part of the neighborhood I mean that was on that down i think so many people turned up they went into the hall so if effectively of ivan indiana wooden anna was on but i did sit in on the meeting and them you guys come in for a bit of them but a hammering at times but i think they they ended pretty well the apologies to dsi arrived about five o 'clock and i went to be the Fosters realize what was going to happen i think in hindsight we would have bet you know be near to to back out so Thank You counselors who did that with it I just want to say that his staff had been preparing since the Monday for an event such as that we had been putting information together on the basis that we felt there would be potentially our strength of feeling doma i think that 's a good thing I think it 's wrong it 's very thing that we get nobody turning lips and consultation or no feedback and when we get that we have to embrace it and I think your staff we 've again work this week to develop a plan moving forwards and I think it 's a really positive thing and I 'm sure we 'll come out with a good outcome thank you cancer pack I think you know just just for my information really and we do hit the capital of spinder projects pages like spreadsheets that then when we go to some of the financials and there are projects listed life cycle don 't have their own spreadsheets and such was just wondering why we have a capex project updates for some and not others as far as in the world that was a scary thing visit yes I think we just highlight the top number of projects that are actually of significant scale the rest we just list the projects voice lesson as well as this specific project you want to be thus to let us now and we can put information that we include it that 's the chasms through the tier creek there are the very minor finishing touches to to go on the storyboards at the top of the post in particular there John I understand they 're on traffic the moment our names are they clips another not clubs we 're working with cheering a Tucker on those so there 's been a few changes in there so might that slowed the process up a little bit but we 're still working on we 're on track with us secondly was rebar teen answer Cooper decision to for the senior business meters have been added to the has actually been with me to all the business owners think so Christian cancer cousins alucard I know if I was off the top of my head but it was covered used today and with flats and 5m premier modified and in da club and these numbers I think they 've got something like 30 min tools and I think and there 's been around about 20 interactions but I 'm if you refer back to their sex monthly report that young that will give you the most recent one bee gees cancer Jong Un 's I 'm on sorry I 'm three-bar to under financial performance under league hitting bowel wave spend actual year-to-date an area quite a difference in some of those figures just asking the question are there any schedule or delivery complications here that are I 'm I understand will vanish eligible crystal right now will add more detail that that revolves around resource consenting issues not being able to get the relevant consents for an infrastructure project so if you look at page 3 x 35 you 'll see that the major variances are as water areas and mr. Lewis one of those resources consents has been in the one for how many years now good i use i guess i ask the questions about there any risks for us just when you look at this top line figures quite a variation thank you can students you know a couple of our viewership three bar seven in regards to the motor over wastewater plant it says proposed savings from other existing projects will meet the additional funding requirements what are those other projects that the savings have come from what 's through the cheer refer you back to page three bar 35 where this it is a schedule of wastewater projects and it 's largely within those projects so it 's a combination of the whole lot Crete if they keep terms of those are number 317 and I 'm a will be wrong with us in regards to the seal extension from Marty a road it states the budgets 148,000 a thought in February it said 402 or maybe getting my roads mixed up we retired both know since the 420 was the original period 148 was the budget for the multi a seal extension and they cost where Marty road was completed about receiving that notch at a cost to bargain for a thousand they gave its got here that it 's completed and april of this year that 's so great that was completed two works okay that 's that 's reason arise i couldn 't work out here something is not not complete lake lanier we 've got a final some then available because the report was written out in advance the moutain such a termination the last one did say actually march yeah the report was written before the work had been completed thank you Oh case all right I Castle Williamson yes through the children community engagement and through about 12 just 47 in Hridaya group meeting couple weeks ago this one 's a really nice compliment come on her tiny community engagement team on the work they 're doing with the youth there was the mentoring program of the year twelves from the cultures from the district and rest last week week for group of a setting organized college and it was well received and we 're proposing to do that with the tower College very near future so just so Hellmouth yep thanks council room son five so buddy what funny worship binder conversations Amanda yesterday in regards of my concerns from the last month in regards a full-year budget figures changing on a monthly basis and I was briefed that my publicly to report to today okay the one that council body raised was than the capex where the wastewater activity budget to drop 250,000 reason for that is that the winter waste what a control system project which covers as also those two areas was sitting in that budget and the waste water budget we 've moved it to the investment budget where the normal IT capex comes out of so you will see that the investments fully budget is increased by 250 thousand and the wastewater has dropped by to 50,000 it was just really a Miss classification of an activity and to make it consistent with what the actuals will be we did that particular change to the full-year budget so effectively than capital expenses exchange that we can expect for your budgets to change on a monthly basis no no that was a one-off and all those other fluid budgets because I checked it yesterday and line with the 1415 any plan yet what here yep yep it will examine I the only to chat the only changes was to 250,000 being switched from wastewater to the investment and respect of that control system project which council approved the last council meeting so then tomorrow then that the figures that I 'm looking at now not to my next month that will be the same correct Thank You mr. park okay it 's okay okay good okay thank you mr. Williams officer Sam but I have a move a police chief acceptor here counselor cousins thank you Cena Bokassa Dolan 's those in favor please say aye against Kerry item number for business accountability documents received right _"

    "text": "Oh afternoon counselors and Amir and yet you will see there is a secret index to the agenda item she will have which has yea rather sizable piece of paper um which has the six monthly reports and the statements of antique 45 of our council control organizations the electoral protection trust goes through to that joint committee rather than through to the capsule so this agenda item is to receipt the half yearly reports and and basically from that site and then also to receipt the statement of intent which will then be reviewed and brought back to council meeting next month to be delivered to the CCOs by the first of May is in line with the legislation so any Christians Arlo 's any feedback council officers are currently reviewing the statements of intent I know that DJ LT has run a workshop on that which a number of councillors attended but if you have any further questions please feel free to email them through to me thanks Chloe any questions no sir cousins we just didn 't discussion at lunchtime the counselors will just want to figure just regards to c SI ellos la classes as local government the organizations from employment perspective well I 'm probably not the recommending the designation of public service do they look I 'm not sure from an important point of view but a lot of the legislation and covers council controlled organizations so if you take for example the corner so and cultural control organizations are subject to exactly the same we are from an appoinment perspective you just got the whole diaper the annual leave they leave accrual we just send all the standard practice for local government and then we raised the question was raised they actually local government yeah okay so perhaps us to help dates they are secret organizations so if you take your questions around each nation ground like Tocqueville recently there are separate trust to super bored so in terms of the management of that organization all the governance of it that Nets down to the ball that 's appointed through the council control organization ultimately you can and the case of destination grown-up table you will point the board but in terms of governance board which is the six trustees of destruction grail example if you use that as an example so in theory that could be completely to be separate from their managers a secret trustee I think mr. chairman Sorry Sorry Sorry what I was going to say is is that the shareholder of that CCO you can provide feedback on that six monthly report which gives those employee entitlements to that board and give them a possible that 's one of the risks you run as elected members if you have ccos and you do appoint the board is that your board can go off and do things that you actually don 't want it to do and that 's where these accountability documents do actually pay dividends in terms of keeping on what the board is intended to do and where it 's going and that 's where the scrutiny really needs to be applied and also where you need to take care pointing those board members except that of a little the problem that I have anyways the fact that i think was indicated yesterday that the reason it 's based on what we do for this organization which to me seems counterproductive but we have no control over that ball but it starts out saying this is what you do here this is what we 'll do for our board so my understanding of that is that the air board has chosen to adopt the council 's policies on employment measures so they follow a number of our policies which includes our hourly for diseases and they also now having the same problems as we are in regards of arrears and all the sort of drama it 's getting very messy because it 's a liability on this council or that board and strew a chair unfortunately it 's not completely black and white as far as ccas are concerned it if you look at two other ccos one is the tap of airport and it 's questionable to extend that that 's a CC over some d t or t EG or tea the staff are employed by council and the other CCO that you have to consider here is the local government funding agency which different types of ccos so it 's not a one size fits all okay any other questions of clay councillor kruszewski it 's perhaps more of an observation which I had raised in the past haven 't had the pleasure of reading through this document a number of times now on page 55 under the less and agreement particularly the joint procurement initiatives where we talk about them looking for procurement of that and items such as insurance brokerage and methods of debt such items we don 't go to the Bob less and they do exactly the same sort of thing and I once again raised that question as regards to duplicating items in matters which now I 'm just raising the issue do we actually need to have both organizations do the same sort of thing for us through the chair I actually asked exactly the same question less than a week ago of my senior management team is are we getting the dividends that we need to get from being shareholders in both condors agreed as a management team to look a bit deeper into that although about 12 to 18 months ago was that will happen in the benefits the advantages that we have will be remembered but less or so number shareholder of thoughtless and lasses that we can pick the best of both worlds the difficulty is especially from our time is that I get drawn into different directions for two different company structures which is which is fine providing we still retain the benefits yeah it 's very much of horses for courses that they 'll deal with different things and have different structures in the bay which we can tap into but the same with the Waikato so at any time where I believe that it 's not providing this benefit I 'd certainly bring a report to Council to advise you of that you write any other Krishna play okay suggested resolution there I have a move please for their resolution hey scout somebody second but cancer jolons all those in favor please say aye aye inst carried item number five business controller systems upgrade Georgiana good afternoon right for the two and the

here experiences and dealing with this organization yes absolutely it was one of the reference chicks we did if they were a reference check it was a positive yes it was I 'm also horror from nowhere have dealings with crosman Richards as well so yeah so Christine I think I hinted at that at it last time we spoke and that was as regards to the all up costs these type of projects that tend to be after the the the project has completed you seem to be getting all sorts of different pads on add-ons and whatnot and I would really be quite interested in knowing what the all app finished cost is going to be absolutely so this amateur item is just outlining the work required from crosman richards which is the budget of 600 k and the will be additional IT costs for server the server infrastructure and that we 're just going through at the moment it is budgeted for okay thank you Justin listen to that that the budget that Andrew Jones talking out for the infrastructure we need no matter what no matter what system you have so like a current infrastructure we 've got some server see when they 're actually out of support so without in the system or another one you need any damn those servers which is why its budget another budget agree so cousins just on the page 5 but 5 by 2 in the bottom advantages options options free you go 123456 given seventh one down significant reduction in hacking potential who we want to is going to ask is we 've got 66 advantages in there which to me should have all been just piled into one improve cross organization exhale a bit

move the castle back singer by councillor Williamson thank you resin favor please say aye carried item number seven extension electrical maintenance contract through that you worship again a similar type of thing about a two-year contract for the electrical maintenance for our wastewater water contract again the monitored on a monthly basis for the Equality they 're doing a good job and I will recommend that that extension vehicle Thank You mr. Lewis any questions of us to loose against other cousins no that 's across saskia just one question on seven bar to under considerations financial considerations you say the financial impact of the proposal is estimated be a little bit more clear on that certainly it is a measure of value concrete and some of the work involves being called out and emergencies to deal with pumps that might fail and so what we 're doing is estimating the lot the cost of that based on hourly rates and so that 's why they can be there periods thank you thank you loose okay just just one question than I and seven bar one we we look at the analysis of the options that states here utilize efficiencies in utilizing the efficiencies as that shown up in the contract price I if they 're more efficient carrying out a task it must be a saving to us is that reflected in the cost for that contract as a contractor becomes more familiar with the systems and the pump stations we 're working with them to reduce those costs so that 's reflective and that estimate of what it will cost for an on an annual basis in key thanks to us okay thank you so just resolution there have a move please thank you can select lingual the borough council Suski those in favor please say aye I was against carried item number 8 f linked sculptures proposal mr. read a couple of things I want to just say and so you 'll recall that we had that I presented these in firmly about a month ago prior to ironman this this is opportunity to make a formal decision that I think this is the first sculpture that 's come to this council and but just to give you a bit of background previous councils have tended not to make comment on the art and their services it 's not acceptable because art is in the eye of the beholder I guess and more about agree in their location and I also a draft member and of understanding so any questions so do we end up owning these or not yep so all the data transfers to cancel on ship that starts clearly outlined in mou yeah and the other thing the only thing I was going to question was that we have a existing landscape architect has he been involved in this process yep yeah this is no you mr. Fraser phraseology aphasic not mr. Joyce year so he 's quite everybody 's locations yep yep cool so no choice right can slightly you 're not already applying for money for my autograph yes so so I should have clarify those fit the usual 5050 so the cost of counsel as outline done in the financial section is six thousand dollars I just wonder whether that should be number three or part of the resolution so that we keep the check of the applications that 's coming in and I we are budgeted there is a twenty-five-thousand-dollar in the long-term plan we tend to keep a running total so when if it got to the point where there 's no money probably the through mr. Tim and the short answer has led us with an officer delegation hinz that 's why we haven 't requested their permission it 's been but can I just comment on that I think bearing in mind where we 've been in the past in terms of not having the mountain a resolution linked to a particular budget it might be prudent to actually link it to that budget and have it is an amount and I yeah I 'm thinking of a certain the cycle where we weren 't particularly clear on where that was paid for and therefore the ownership issues were questioned down the track says so it might be suggested route number 38 number three yeah yeah well that 's exactly it it clarifies where the money 's coming from as well yep cool counselor precisely just a couple of points please at the first one is actually under memorandum of understanding i would actually wide like to see the word and conditional ownership in there in the other factor that some of the wording and has led us astray in the that on location number two and have has there been any sort of work being done tests to see whether or not there will in fact be any impedance of vision from both cyclists as well as a motor vehicle so on the first point the mo use been through our lawyer so he 's comfortable with us okay but we were with that last time do we have the opportunity I leaned it today and I flee to another that if you want that way is fine and in terms of impediment yes we 've done with log to that we don 't see any impediment impediment because it 's back from the intersection of the roundabout from huge treat of course yeah we don 't see any issues it will certainly be monitored though counselor because if there are any issues particularly with people crossing as well and not being viewed by vehicles turned in the corner so our traffic team will be keeping a watch and briefed on that thank you okay any other questions steering them just where the odds the memory of understanding them I is the one that we 've got an hour arag into paper I 'm just learning for consistency I noticin the bike one and have a look at the scope of trust won 't_''_1111.48 i can 't funny and specific to do with damage and vandalism but the memorandum we 're talking about at the moment states take always more practical measures to protect how do you actually do that in the real world is that voting as if we don 't put a feed six-foot-high around it it could be channels that we haven 't taken reasonable steps the second one is in regards of the membrane of understanding for the sculpture it 's that states disputes to resolve within five working days the one for the bike was 20 working days do we need to be consistent in our memorandums so the first the first point was around sorry the first point was around all practicable steps i guess in response about the ways being constructed it 's pretty bulletproof and i think if you refer back to the what if you talk about the big giant bike isn 't in the realms of that and that 's the this is a lot i guess that 's a common this is a standard agreement where is the journals a negotiated agreement based on a standard agreement so I think that 's the outcome that we 've seen this is more the standard arrangement for the typical type of scenario that we face and in terms of those practical practical steps this is in an area that a lot more eyes on it than them certainly the giant boa card and we do have CCTV coverage in this space as well so it 's an extra deterrent so effectively the scope to trust mentions five working days as well does it for dispute resolutions the scubs trust one does you okay thank you okay all right Thank You mr. Adamson a new number three been the six thousand dollars to be allocated funding from the public house budget you happier that yes you happy to move or then while moving down absolution with included yes items we just a mean the memorandum is suggested i cancelled ended which is moved by Councillor clean second abroad cancer ostrosky thank yous Malaysian favor please say aye highs against Gary item number nine food act 2014 good afternoon Jane _"

    "text": "rebs resolution mr. Neal war good afternoon counselors this is just the item to follow one I 'm after the adoption of the long-term plan that some allows us now to implement the long-term plan and collect the money to enable us to do that so take it as read this is any questions Thank You mr. Ward any questions or a sword Jim just a point of clarification this resolution is to enable us as a council destroy traits that great correct so that the legal process is that you first must adopt the long-term plan or an animal trainer than an angle plan cycle and the very next thing you must do is to do a rates resolution under the local government rating Act which sits out as this does the various rates and what they are and the two dates for payment and the due dates for penalties for the fever 's not passed we can 't_''_73.409 do the ratings that needs to be fast that is great if you do not pass this you do not pass go live with your in-laws will go home now but here is Reese we have fun as a time defend the castle all right any other questions of mr. mr. Ward okay okay suggested resolution there boo mobile by councillor party scene about counselor buddy all those in favor please say aye that 's against carried thank you item number seven request for an extension of a typo sidewalk and street cleaning contract who 's doing that one mr. Lewis you were asleep early okay this is a continuation of area existing suppliers oh right your worshipness this is for North their 5th year of an extension of a contract for the cleaning of the footpaths and Cuban channels and the CBD another discrete areas like the AC baths and as I said it 's the fifth year extension of a current contract and I 'd take the reporters written take any questions thank you Miss first councilor Dolan 's you worship and mr. Lewis just a question of clarification the contract was assigned to enter group during the contractual period notice understand what what that was don 't agree purchase that companies that originally run the contract okay work thank you Jim the Christian does this company operate in other towns around New Zealand so yes it does this might sound after I will see the guy with the vacuum cleaner picking up the box out of the gutter etc is that is he part of that oh then he 's not part of it it 's what it very filmy way what exactly they 're part of their canteen what streets are they do is I said earlier it 's generally the CBD the curve journal and the footpaths and then other discrete areas like just in front of the office here at by the ANC bars and typically you won 't see them because they usually start about four o 'clock in the morning and a finished by about six or 630 in the morning so they do they do the elevator anyway that pass some of the restaurants would you looking bit grubby I 've ready public streets and so some of an early wait no it depends what you remember in any way they do some of the excess lines and let go if streets and they 'll do the public streets but they don 't do private anyway so the one that goes out Robert streets needs up by the two photo card pack it 's not part of it because I made complaints of area they look at its life Nicki cool straightforward Thank You Dennis so just as resolution they moved by Councillor faxing the broadcaster strip where those in favor please say aye aye inst carried item number eights museum and library delivery supply and delivery of the shop reading materials Louisa afternoon known everyone this report that i take that you 've already read as i 'm seeking Council 's approval to join the Bay of Plenty Regional Library group contract for the selection catalog in processing and supply of collections we have an annual budget of three hundred and ten thousand dollars approved in the LTP over the next three years this cost includes a selection processing and cataloging costs so that the books arrived for shelf reading the council without to timber for supply in april of this year we went out for a three-year contract plus we also in touch as part of a Bay of Plenty library group and contract as well and we that was with Rotorua libraries mr. by plenty attorney and carollo libraries and that was for a period of one year plus one plus one and there was an error in your report I apologize and it 's plus one plus one when you 're 18 the proposals were received the reason we went out for two to make sure that we could get a July for your start date for a noose for a contract and we also wanted to make sure we secured the best price the tenders were evaluated using a way should attribute method and the Bay of Plenty group library tender came on the sorry the type of district councils tinder came in at a higher cost compared to the regional by a plenty library group tender and this was based on average prices quoted in the team to contract we can expect to get more titles for the same price going with a group contract adores will also allow us to try and achieve the peer thousand population yeah any questions yeah any question yes so the actual price I 'm just trying to work out with is there an actual price when I was at the phosphor block 310,000 now Rudy adopted through us a gym and you 've already adopted the budget and the last ones from the long-term plan so this isn 't a life in the more tender where you 're assuring a tinder for a set price he has a per book up to the budget that you were just approved in the long term plan right okay that 's slightly different to the mall okay and so what you 're saying is Andrew our normal teen to process it was 2764 pips a adult fiction but with the regional group your 2683 yes Korea so it 's a bit of a saving than not overly what well that ends up as we as I say in the report and over 700 more titles just in those four categories I yep on average cool it was the German the 300,000 is inflation adjusted in the long-term plan so effectively we just a query is the library manager if is there any difference between the variety of choice that you have with the different suppliers like I know we 've got at a price per book but with Bay of Plenty your choices that won 't be compromised absolutely March um there is the potential for the group to work together on a coordinated basis that we wanted to but we would still continue certainly it to select what we want for our libraries our suppliers with this contract we have multiple suppliers so we retain our specialist supply as well as the MEXT general supply that we need now that 's good to hear because I know price is an important factor but also getting been able to get access to the variety yeah it 's also crucial to get people through those doors particularly our our younger people yep so you see that we 've got six suppliers thank you cool cops are having see the opportunity for the Talpiot districts library to match the Bay of Plenty price while we 're suggesting the bad kind of price here price so they 've both been offered to us by suppliers near the table District Council plus there 's libraries Bhatinda versus the regional and regionals come out cheaper so let 's do that I guess what that also does as enables us to work more regionally episode of us another step along that way regional libraries are looking at things like one membership card across all of the libraries and things like that so the question previously about variety and if you 've got some suit in the bin which doesn 't get a lot of use in one particular area thus enables us to all over access to it so it sort of working smarter I get I think in terms of regional collaboration it 's a positive and we already share a platform with the Pope into libraries for e-books yeah should is waking it and its paste yeah for them alright thanks Lissa I 'm any other questions or queries all right this suggested reservation yeah i just thank you all for the work until you pass on to the team down there again why opportunity about the library and the museum and they sort of things I just appreciate appreciate all the good work you do I could mover fully Thank You castle donington signaling breakups likely will those in favor close eye on it 's against carried item number line afternoon near the moment to the colonel a preserved management planned mobile kiosk just quickly introduce item and we have salmon jolly was a default I stole a kingdom from Peckham Biddle here today Jan solutions cool you may have only proposal so they 've approached us to set up a mobile mountain biking kiosk on the can lock domain we the proposal supported by bike topol and and the location of the proposed mobile kiosk and supports the use of backed opals bike shelter is the hub for mountain biking in can lock and in turn that also help to promote that area as being the hub for mountain biking and locate vehicle traffic to that reserve rather than the lakefront and as the activity isn 't provided for in the reserve management plan the first step is to consult with the public or community feel on the proposal so the recommended resolution there is to undertake public consultation and it just so happens that policy are consulting on some other and measures and canucks that we can do that alongside that process shortly thanks oh and good afternoon Simon mmm good to see you and yeah so looks pretty straightforward to me and any questions of ella no I 'm just sailing yeah I just wonder whether we could have a response from the two promoters you don 't come at accordion food something in the slightest in terms of probably what you expect to

necessities inner tubes tie yes yes ok that 's fine yes yeah ok good I think just the outstanding success of the track area like the movements there are some I think they 'd planned for about three or four thousand the year but how many years a delegate of that track the denied huge yeah 30,000 us to use it yeah yeah so obviously you see an opportunity there were people are asking for these sort of fun services oh yeah yeah cool so good on you thank you for being entrepreneurial about and coming up and you have our questions or crew source ama no hindon no you don 't foresee it with the public consultation process so what what what does it how will I do go in that scenario out flyers on the scotsman rang in excess place reserved yep so i 'll just so i put rating base around the clock here

all the water charges around a different district schemes manga keno in fact has a drop dollar 24 and I think Terry goes up 65 cents I 'm just wondering how they 're going to cover this expenditure

late it was done on a three plus one plus one this is the end of the three years what has been suggested as the extension of that first year and we will then look at the need to maybe get and tender at that particular point of time that stage the handover the ETA would have occurred etc and would have a clearer idea what our require so hard for street lighting as soon as I see correct me if I 'm out of my arithmetic is wrong but in the original first three years the cost per annum was about two hundred thirty four thousand dollars whereas the current extension as proposed at two hundred ninety thousand dollars is that they 're within acceptable industry level yeah it 's acceptable that 's it what you find is the based on the experience of the first three years it helps set the

against Harry title number eleven to putter to paddle road Maori Land Court update Robert worship counselors this is just a brief update and because we had a formal decision on purpose isn 't if you like this is a long history dating back well some ways dating back for 1938 but in terms of the Maryland Court proceedings defense 2009 the court has finally issued a decision following a hearing in the middle of the year the crucial thing from the council 's point of view was that the debate was about whether to power and its adjoining roads and Acacia Bay were still legal roads the court has found that they are however that 's still running I think it ends next week and there are still three applications in front of the court so this is an update once we know what the adjoining owners are

members that was there and so thank you again for supporting me in attending that meeting and i would i would say to all councillors it would be very beneficial even if you 're not a chair of the

    "text": "which is you worship before you wish before my just answer the question from the g night and three of will you answer that means that all right from the team p is that all right to do it now yes sure and so i 'll just raced down grab the Treasury policy on page 22 of the shrew jury policy allows for New Zealand registered on banks makes my limit up to one hundred percent hints the comment we won 't be breaching shifted upwards from eighty percent 200 a new policy so it was difficult to yeah yeah okay yeah long-term plan we 're going to have a copy of it put this on one side yeah slowly it 's really answer for you boys thank you okay life is copy that we 've been going out and there 's always like a new latest copy and but I 'll get to that in the mud I 've first the ones who am Sailor as well done in congratulations and we 're going to review today and the second thing I want to say was that we 've be released to us following the adoption so there 's just a process that it is in place they release the draft and then they release the final signed version once you 've actually adopted the long-term poo but as you can see and if you like the long-term plan is possible it has required tests and able to adopt the following campaign and there is another title bit near vision of a champion today is there are some changes that i want to bring their teaching to that came is a as a result of the bit it will be a minor which you 'll see when we go through them and the first one I 've actually given away that might I get to you guys into one that I 've sorry on our page 47 you 'll see there is some track changes so it would have just asked that I owed the percentages for those three four formats which is the herb from the 2013-14 will serve another 2014-15 responses as well just as the 21 sealed a deep sea in a single 5% shown in 're aware that we 've got our new measures that were introduced by the Department of Interior fears called the loan financial measures one of the struggles that we had with one of them is that we forced a little don 't actually have properties that connect to a slender system which is unusual across the country and we had to just provide a little bit of a further explanation as to why we weren 't going to measure against the motor to go measure so that will be something that only measures are various across New Zealand you 'll see you get the photographer because we we can 't measure them because we don 't do it so order whatever hoping a fitting in with the explanation that we have there the other edition is on page 88 what it just wanted us to make a note fish on all of the financial tables that the shaded column was the 2014 in your plan computer so that and people would understand that the 2014 it was the 2014-15 in your plane and the other change was a change to statement and I 'll don 't have any questions if you 've got anything about that and they 'll also look at limiter to just update the schedule to the phones in the prospective statement of cash flows we also replaced those two financial is well and the other thing that we did was we made some very minor changes to Puebla in names throughout the document so for example there are still a few our drafts hanging around in those or so on some to your plans structure strategy so if we remember too long to implode we 've changed type or without a matte chrome to topi with a matte chrome area so put the coach 9 and further our drinking water standards Oh presumed there 's also some minor changes they 've made to the fluoride Astro box but the messages are still design in terms of little it assumes I 'm so rather than living like the pages with a trek change showing totally with American i just decided to give you a whole new vision joomla this they could just ask one of those work mentioned again sure that 's just an illusion section in it is on page 32 I 'm not sure if anybody amazing other questions or particularly maps the block to make our gas the long-term plan or the responses that are opposed to some models and there 's just one more addition to make for the responses to the museum submissions it was just around adding some notes about the timing of food the development of the museum will be considered as part of the LTP 2011 or if some butchers you pursuits itself part of us thanked 0 ok the moment has come and any other questions or queries a real answer kruszewski this is the upper taught at the time or the opportunity to ask questions as regards to some with the responses yes yeah what 's all part of it I the resolution of you have is that do you want us to adopt a first limb to the response a second or worth what 's best way you 're all were you happy to handle the responses now please yeah uncle ok thanks gotta get a just to start with overall I 'd like to thank area for the responses and I think overall they are quite good but I do wonder whether out of them courtesy and if we wish them to encourage future submitters that all the submitters should be thankful their submissions and not just some of them as we have this document like there 's enough matching previously and we 'll move leashes to the submissions will erase the first thing to do is think them got a very start what foot willing so what we see in here is not the actual final so we 'll select is the way and look at each submission boot we 've had those discussions with you through durations and it appears draft responses and based on the discussion and what will their happens we will go through and callate we love these to give a similar so for example submitter 27 may have submitted a few different database to give Alicia and so that their peer response to each part of your submission right and is realize our introduction to the mission otherwise I some of the changes that may happen when we put those letters to do that is if it when you 're reading through the leader doesn 't sound pop button or just tweaks other words to like it shorts pull out and and appropriate this is it summarized here if you like clip of activities rather than giving it any less but you 'll get golf club when we complained it on page 18 to 31 when we talk about grilling Taupo would it be appropriate to include the fact that we have indeed now or we 're going to have a counselor pointed tude to the gleaming cowper audit steering committee I 'm happy to put it at some point you need to decide who that 's going to be it 'd be nice to include down there will be a point oh just just a comment your worship in here I 'm on page two email that was sent out that 's going to be a press release nothing highlight in the standard poor 's new rating and I just feel that we can to sell ourselves a and I just wondered if I standouts a little bit late in there in the session but somewhere in there should we not be highlighting that and soon they sort of came out sort of grandeur yeah we hadn 't had it confirmed did we when we did that sort of bonus Buy we head but thank the boys you will sir Merrick survey now m and we adopt were sympathetic and the new rating is on our long-term projection of our financial situation so I just right just make a comment is it possible to put that in the at this late stage no I can do to make a change to the this page and any further changes no you make a change to the message to the message okay well Mazel how did the other cancers online give ya can be the first paragraph you like I mean you 've got a section on the oh yeah the finances ok so you happy to leave that to myself and ariel and perhaps Lisa the graphic yep oh cool okay and their cancer treatment I think you had um page once it 's the one or four new one sorry Christy can Mike so yeah but what page 161 offer 161 and so the second lot of bullet points under investigation for upgrading quite like a buddy 's probably supposed to be its own bullet point in the word and it says to Donna in serenity kovetz and no longer called serenity Cove so I 'm just looking new people come into the area won 't know what that is let 's go wipe army farms and right at the last the last sentence it says to ensure its compliance is that right sorry I 've lost we won in the last sentence it 's easy to ensure compliance all right um who was next gasps a bit have you come back in love just yeah I 'm eight and under page 41 year top one and where we say funding for the resi love the velodrome has been included in the parks and reserves as it mentioned plan would be pertinent to put down what year that would be aged 42 submission 169 the middle second of 53 and submission 205 I was present with mccarroll at the White original council long term plan submission and it was my understanding that there was already a plan in place and that we that we were waiting on regional council to implement that but the way it 's reading here is that they 're waiting on us to come up with a plan and for a program so a possibility page 53 and councillor Williamson might actually be able to assist me on that because I think you were on the committee that heard the program the plan program can I respond to that knows the onus is on council this council to deliver the program so what was the program that down that had been presented the way back in two thousand that was a that was a program of works but without what WRC after his detail so we provided a list of high risk of risk assessed areas they 've always been up to detail which begin to work on now so that 's a fully costed program which we weren 't able to provide at to do that thank you passed it h-60 under submission 162 and our response and the last sentence I think there 's some sort of them the sentence needs is we transpose somehow I 'll have a look at them see what we can do and it just a wide needs to yes you can move up someone page 69 on the top response where we 've gone about council will develop a guiding philosophy for this community fund over the next three years as I recall council jonath made a recommendation which was passed by counsel that we will look at it I see this coming year not within the next three years Fiddler 's the capsule is correct but however I believe that that was decision was made after probably these submission replies were put together because when I 've read through them there are things have taken place after the replies and i think that the one with the case you 're talking about at the moment council and i can make the change to her to the twelve within the 12 months and I my recollection that reading ready to hit the discussion that 's right I think we should communicate to the submitters because it was a issue that was raised by suppose and just from my clarification on page 82 when we now talk about the Oxfam music festival is that part of the Oxfam trail thing that is now a lot no longer with us in which case we probably shouldn 't mention that particular one in this and the same response and I think that that applies to a number of responses okay fine it was we so that 'll do thank you thank you for your patience thank you can just asking ok any other various questions Castle willemsen so it 's not really a question this regard kirsty approach 160mg more attention please just a spelling mistake with reckon you 're right and another unit think so he 's fillable Sutil drive nothing here that doesn 't yeah doing breakage Briggs that 's right besides me like a no smoke no that 's wrong Oh check this come on well check that one out don 't cancel him some yes castle princess will have one less emissions carmine it would give me great pleasure to actually move and recommend that the power sound that suggested resolutions thank you very much Castle croissants know the chair I just have a couple of queries myself of my may first thank you um I really hope the intention is that these letters to the recipie ters who will they come from and they 're coming from us as counselors or from the council staff what was your intention there yeah that is a question to ask yourselves um it 's up to you who would write them to come from so you need to change I believe it should come from us over to my fellow councillors is normally opened there 's been a variety of options that have been used and so sometimes they 've kept on me you know the times they 've come from yourself so I Tony with counsel jolons these missions were made to us the reaction by staff they should become feet from us I mean at the end of the day the wheel at the point all the staff here and ourselves that are put this work together but i think the messages back to the community because the submit is submitted to us we need to own this we need to put our names on it and i think i should come from the counselors yep would you be happy for me to sign it on behalf of the counselors or I think because of jaws is a few point will support that is what all of a sign or no navin studies but i think the tone in the direction be that it 's from us as the council acknowledging the work of everyone in this process of course but yeah sure I just had a couple of other points just for clarification the audit New Zealand report notes that we completed the audit on the twenty-third of June is that just a procedural matters to coincide with the fact that we 're going to adopt it at this point that 's right all right and in the last point I just had to make was one of the recommended resolutions is that we view as a counselor I 've noted my descent I guess against the revenue and financing policy and I want to capture capture that but I also recognize the need to approve and pass the LTP is part of a very important procedural matter what 's the best way to address such as that your distinct normal implementing policy was captured when we only policy pass the resolution I 'm not sure who else you would do is that anything yeah I think any other way to deal with it I 'm not sure whether we wish to an honest to go throw it section by section or but how you know you 've to adopt the long jump in its entirety and I guess the living influencing policy through a quick and the lightest changes the local government in the past it 's just wind power the long-term planning now you 've to consult a lot separately which was what we did in an adult lip seal in building in pain so I guess effect that we 've conveyed you to suit to the OC individually allows you to 't it recognizing that okay thank you shall worship can I just have that clarified at this time three years ago whenever it was when the last long term plan was in this chamber there was a division between two parts I think all the counselors were in favor of the long-term plan but there 's one part a number objected to because it wasn 't able to be taken in parts they voted no and therefore they were voting against things that they actually agreed within that long-term plan they voted against a particular policy that the council was one in to be introduced and that 's the dilemma that i have whether i made my descent known at the time of the debate i think i had my right to work six by section because there 's a lot in this long term plan i support in calculate some things that I don 't if I can 't then I 'd have to vote no to its entirety take it thank you thank you any other cancers so just to confirm we need to even need to drop it not part of it right and I think you know the counselors are thinking of you you wanting to vote you know against the plan that retains that current levels of service and across the district and you know reduces our debt 160 a moment poor decision certainly as I I 'm talking I gave a point of order excuse me you know reducing the motor the deep 460 203 mill by 2025 and investments going up 243 mill and that 's up to the individual counselors some to decide on sorry well it 's been the long term papers being moved by cancer kruszewski singing too broad council heckling anyone else want to make any comments for or against okay with that thing okay Castle himself I know this slide is no or this note on give us some sort of simple terms of they will be through civil processors for us because of the long term plan and I 'm you know the democratic process right through its being an authority that 's the way the whole system works and authority and decision will this writer on rehearing to support the document authorities all right okay being moved and seconded so one two one two and three on the suggested resolution there in just passionate thank you so much again to all the staff and all the public some others out there huge submissions we got and also to the counselors that have committed this last 18 months project how many workshops hero 22mm any two workshops and endless meetings so well done to everyone and the order says it all you know they are very happy with it so I 'd like to it 's been moved by kaspersky sings about counseling all those in favor please say aye oh those against Oh No okay so you have a division please so councillor body and councillor jolons against the long-term plan but they recorded thank you very much item number six it was not to be recorded I asked for a division which the names voted either way to be written down this is human so so you don 't want your against being recorded I wanted a vision where the names of those voted either _"

Fox around the UM if you was happy with it yes you use for the moment I happy where that they 're aware of it they 're giving him what you can break yeah thank you okay regards of the souls of broadens rhodine feel under solid wastes in bar six the survey work is going to be undertaking the final design is planned to be completed the last report said it was after Christmas so winds are going to be now I 'm not aware of the exact date I 'm sorry we know is it 's on track at the moment we 'll find out the date for you you 're like okay the opponent seven by nine and that investments zero hana undertaken we are we with us assessments as it was stated in november through the chair there is a major issue with that forest as far as access is concerned we need to give agreement from the surrounding farmland to access the trees to go to harvest and that was still work in progress i believe there 's a on select meeting this week or tomorrow to see whether we can achieve the axis it 's a very difficult for us to actually harvest thank you we still going through the CIA 's report by internal in regards to seven bar 14 where are we actually worth of the bacterial compliances because meant after months that is there water treatment plants don 't comply the torture of gardens you need 12 months worth of results unless the issue that we have with our plants is that we haven 't got 12 months worth of results for the controller gradings to be given we 're in the process of building up the record so that we can provide 12 months worth of records and that 's because then you knew you on 7 x 15 one of the highlights about the new slow speed limit for the 800 meters from the high waves downpour happy road has been great we 've received by the public and it seems to be I 've had it mentioned to me probably about a dozen times the signs are other cool so under a high school gym the water new in water treatment plant to the last report it was to be completed in October 16 now we 've got december twenty 15 is all that funding come through then that is one of the topics for discussion under the consultation to the long-term plan council at some stage depending on the feedback from the residents will need to make a decision as to whether they proceed or not so until with in that position it would seem a shame to say goodbye to a major government subsidy but it 's a decision that councils going to estimate based on feedback from the consultation council Williamson switch your but 75 pt1 regulatory revenues up but with respect to building you see me 116,000 healer plan a role for welcome a moment yes nervous amount of work out of the building sector it 's good positive it is positive yep it 's difficult for the team to cope and but the capital a global evolved with some support from South Waikato in particularly and we sort of throw the brick now but there has been a wealth of building work given the during a wastewater treatment plant 723 and the bottom the key risks in regards of it away with the materials why was that not included in the original planning of the total budget the original budget it seems that we need to consent to do that through the chair will come back to you on that mr. Lewis is not able to join us this afternoon to answer it off off the cuff I believe that things evolved once that the plant was put in place that weren 't playing fallen in the first place and that this is a part of it that will come back to your level thank you well it said its achievement if we move on into 725 the in August no report in September no report in October I think there might have been one in October I notice on page seven 225 that we now have five red crosses I think there were 33 more than in June yes that is correct it one count father the nature of them one is related to the ANC corporate bond which has since been sold and in our draft treasury management policy we have changed the ratios to align with the OG if I funding requirements and as stated in the treaty announcement report we align with those particular ratios these historical ones what we have to measure against until the new treasury management policy has been accepted via the decision bar 26-year you worship or ID on the bottom of page we have another red cross through actual return against budget it 's an explanation for that we are down point oh four of a percent sorry we 're not there sighs to be able to budget to that level we budgeted at five percent it 's come out of four point nine six one eight or four an explanation 7 x 27 regards of bauer one international equities we have a new read cross there just just a clarification counselor all of the crosses the first page of the reporters are some way so all of the crosses on the first page correlate through to to the risk the document so it 's not an edition of the crosses the subsequent pages are where they relate to this is therefore this question is not it to do with that in an additional read cross I want to refer to the gross external debt at the bottom of 727 at 17.5 we were not to exceed fifteen percent and this is it was 17.5 back at the last report that some we 've explained that one previously we took out some pre-funding was the old GF age due to the attractive margins in the market at the moment 25 million dollar pre-funding so we 've invested that 25 million at an arbitrage making money for the right pass so hint sex cause that factor to bridge and the debt-to-equity ratio is not part of the treasury management policy the LTP it 's a parameter that 's acknowledged for the public sector here that 's not really quite appropriate so there won 't be there in the others not there in the policy that you 've um subsequently signed off you worship could are there for a spin 728 it was picked up a report which he did on the theory of sick timber at the bottom of the final page we used to have point for cash management daily bank balances that seems to been removed for the last from the last two reports was there a reason for that because we exceeded the range in February six times March 14 six times may three it 's probably quite important area to still be on that report must be good reason for it not ahead and hate happy to answer that one again this has been previously explained to counsel and we we have put in place now what 's known as a sweep account with the banks so what happens there is that that goes through in a few effectively the current account is swept down to like the savings or Core account so hints the removal of that measure because it 's it 's now actually impossible to overdraw the account because they 're sweet mechanism is in place in pence that some that 's been removed from the report because it 's not relevant anymore so I 'm going to no other questions wind it up near I want some explanations it has probably been done in the past if we go to seven bar 36 regards to the fair wave expenditure update fulwood budget figures at some occasions change there a reason for that I 'm sorry can it be specific you worship if we go to the ninth of December agenda in the bow wave paper their own seven by nine of that occasion states the full-year budget and regards of community facilities it was 34 for the community sceles facilities in the report before say 495 if we go down to water the previous figures with 560 than our 534 and right at the bottom of the page we have pre visioneer bow laid carried forward there 's a difference there and the figure that the differences I don 't know how that 's come about what I 'm getting at is if you have a budget that states something is now the budget that 's we 're gone for the full year through the cheer I have previously advised counselors they have specific questions of this nature can you please raise and prior to this meeting because naturally we do not have that information at hand and to be able to answer questions now if we are asked prior to a meeting we can source the answers and when you ask the same question at the meeting we can have the answers for you thank you after that and the stir your worship no doubt that that information will come forward because I like to share with my fellow councils okay you have a questions of these Rob okay thank you remove the police resolution you think you can solution seen by cancelling all those in favor please say aye hi is against Kerry item number 8 kara we should auto this one because they on bereavement leave this is an plane changes for the virtue industrial fan pages of the district 's pain operative here is a little bit of update from the item that you put in front of that one is big one is it is ruled on both the cost application by one of the appellant CSS properties in the request relating to some minor wording changes in change duty and you have been circulated a copy of that decision but just for clarification the court has dismissed the cost application made by their party and also dispute the request for the slight change to be to the wedding as a result of that the suggested recommendation also this resolution one can be passed nurse entirety including James duty and so that would make that entire suite of plan changes operative it is a procedural step plus one but there 's one that 's required by the legislation to to make that those plan changes operative as you will note this has been a better seven or eight year process starting from the commercial industrial structure plan going through council hearings environmental court hearings in the subsequent the fact that the operative what that essentially does mean that the new rules have one hundred percent weight in hundred percent effect which will give good certainty to the development community and the community at large in terms of what they can and can 't_''_1215.17 do both in the counseling and in the lens around ETA so quite a milestone moment before the district okay dose of any questions of Gareth guess I move the suggestion resolution you 're insecure but you shouldn 't before you do a lot character case in regards of the suggested resolution and because it includes planned change 30 on page eight bar to at the bottom plan change 30 at states until the court makes a ruling on this matter it would be an appropriate for council to make plan change 30 operative if we move that resolution it becomes operative as that decision comes through so yes and those words referred to before that the the decision on both our costs and pain change 30 ml ins have come through and both on councils flavors so there 's nothing standing in your as regards to are we planning add to have a review of the overall process and the reason I ask is that it has been a challenging process I think it would be fair to say and it would be good to know whether there are any items or issues that we can learn from an implement in the future I 'm sure answers are more than happy to do that and provide feedback and we do it an officer level but i 'm happy to gather feedback from you guys elected members the what i would say is that from our RMA sitting generally and particularly in the space in this commercial space i would say that this has been a fury might not seem a bit of very smooth crystal smooth waters and smooth road and there are other councils and Christ you it 's just as just still going through it now they 've been about double the amount of time that we have bigger issues of course so we 've been numb that 's been incredibly well managed if I say so myself in quite smoothly like to take that opportunity and painter you can surge ominous oh no I was just sorry i was smiling and i was thinking what bernhard was saying i mean we do have a district plan review coming up in the next few years such as any learnings can move by Councillor park i think of us here seeking my counsel of langsam i hope sorry ok I think we got all those in favor please say aye I against Eric item 9 _"

in 250 month has 26th of 826 do you all set smoother to this world oh that 's wrong okay so all right 26 the 99 for June in the points of verification typos or I mean there 's arising for those mother 's cancer chris.cesca yeah just a couple of our made the first one on page one I have my name included please unpaid sir the very first page oh i 'm pretty sure i will say i was here that day yeah sorry about that cancer Starsky and number two on one by 13 down at the very bottom of the page page 74 216 two-year 217 do we address this now or later where where it hasn 't actually been implemented that 's number one and number two is one of the points that are raised also has not been included in the minutes and that was a witch related to page 182 of the draft on the third bullet point under conclusions where I asked the question is whether or not that you why cut original council partner whether we should be the only people that should be held what was the first query sorry what the first query was that page 74 of them updated which are the minister 's our stated are not actually implemented in the dock and a final document they didn 't what do you reckon one by what kind of nicer to the point ando 13 and that 's a dainty effort here you are not around yep the last bullet point sorry two minor changes the Empire 74 fury which you devoted with what cutter regional killed in the world important document I can 't hope you catch this epic I can change it and we just need to check with animals got a handle sorry here sorry yeah yeah yeah how does that applies us from my procedural point of view if we had agreed to put it into the document here but it 's not in the document now for a procedural perspective it doesn 't matter so long as we all agree with what the answer is that why Nick didn 't include its we can then just remit it as a matter and under as a message arising Wendy yep yep come forward 20 slide it up now mmm III so go to the long-term plan page 73 so just on refers to that particular question we hear a discussion and myself a neck about whether or not to include the reference to the Waikato Regional Council and there 's civil reasons why we decided at this stage that we wouldn 't the fiefs turn snitch we have been hearing with many discussions with them about that particular document because it 's very unknown eat who how people will be involved in their particular document so we didn 't want to include the regular Regional Council because they may or may not in there may be others who should also be included as well so it was felt much more prone to just I 'm included as it was I 'd start with so know for a fact that walnut and butter regional why chaotic are going to have two representatives on that board you don 't as are we so I don 't_''_365.39 I don 't quite follow that logic and rationale I 'm sorry OS the do all the parties we were going to be sweet and theaters the right approach to just put one there may be others as well it wasn 't with a little wouldn 't I think um I think maybe it was also involved in the negotiations of that maybe their message in his and got through because that has been settled under the and the intentions documents or the crown of it had identified who those people are so often bust this writing all those tombs as the would be appropriate so that we can hear them so say no I 'm Stephanie my friend is one capsule just a second okay you happy of it and then the last our last point I wanted to raise the point it has been left off which is on page 182 of the draft third bullet point I raised the question is as to whether we should be the only ones that ought to be carrying the total cost of that implementation hundred hundred eighty 2082 182 third bullet point down I 'm not sure what will come so easily say it for the total cost of implementation and carrying on the maintenance of that plane because house when you were counseled oh I think I 'm a little bit well I 182 yep the original draft document which is what we have another sorry can I just clarify um the discussion that we had in the decision that we made was to add the word I thought we were going to add council because I don 't think councillors only to start with we want to clarify that it was adjusting the council infrastructure where are we not the rules are lost as to what web page 182 of the document we 've got now when is 180 okay so ensure than the results in what so what did you want either than me sorry well at the time I question whether we should be the only party how to libel forward for the costs Nessa treats at the month both take some advice on this or is it so it doesn 't leave us does it all it looks as though it makes sense to me I don 't know it 's just a statement in relation to what council needs to do so what council needs to do is we need to ensure that we it we do up hold those agreements in terms of what we are responsible for that that 's the way I would reread it in the way we always have to respond to different legislative changes open for caring de que no lo believe so okay thanks casa could just ski and okay so going through the minutes see again and Kim now counsel buddy 11.4 in regards to vine eatery our mating comments in regards of having contact with excess typo representatives my thing has been but I just like an update have we sort of

at least if we could on that chart that was put together if we could seek some clarification on what the priorities were and put some timings behind that I just think at the time I made the comment because I think it 's important that we show what actions will be taken from these um strategic alliances and that 's why I asked for priorities to be put in and that 's not been captured in the minutes whatsoever can I ask that they 're editing yeah same ones not here no closed up here so the limit of humor when I they will find out yep cool ok any other points of clarification and is arising from most minutes if not if I could ask for move all those months be good they kick ass the heckling second to I was against in carriage item number two to receive the nuts following meetings we we could do these on block as well so go the first one southwestern base settlement reserved min champlain committee to ring you tongariro that doesn 't sound right does it really that 's it yep don 't worry yep community board meeting linking about Connie and they fences riding reserves stock committee okay so any we have a sink shany we 've got a slight adjustment on one I think the meeting cancelled own body was at that was at the night the night for a meeting TCC be heading there are joint dates on the original minutes were wrong as well very good yep and daily meetings we changed the North Virginia yep so those first two do things shiny any other minutes Medes arising little clarification of the minutes to burn on the southwestern bezan to bar seven carries panada maybe the staff had answers we had some discussions about some signage that was to go to explain the history of the area it was that sort of taking place yet where a bit of a project on that reserved about how we would investigate some different mechanisms about how to better reflect the cultural homeless and historical values that project will kick off following adoption of the plane we haven 't_''_849.929 at this stage and put up anything to do with the silence because it needs to be some further investigation about the history behind that and so on thank you thanks salary the other pretty good is even a mighty one you wish it suzette is that sorry to buy 27-3 back we 're taking it 10 doing three is well we 're not only you were doing the four lots of minutes need to specifically go through the recommendations and there 's a recommendation there as well see the recommendation to import through the front item and you 'll need to go through them one by one so go through you want the seats of minutes one by one and you can do them on block but there 's a minutes on block so wherever is before before you do that gives it a tour through the web that we love those okay so do you want to do the do that now so here 's on page two so should we receive the minutes now what we need to do with children as the I guess that 's usually that the cheer people of those meetings where appropriate would normally just outline the issues that have been recommended to the council because and I mean and accepting these recommendations all these minutes you 're also accepting these recommendations so you as a council need to be we arrived in accepting of what we had a pact or the resolution then and the recommendations to be adopted could perhaps have the chair of the southwestern base element as if we draw the attention of the other counselors to those recommendations from the terms roading reserves and dog committee items on the three number one number two just recommending that they 'd be approved by this council you wish you okay thank you that 's the two and three of the number two on the resolution about number one southwestern base settlement reserve and I 'm number one are you

    "text": "adoption of the plane okay so item number seven there is just what I quickly take you through this is for the adoption of the draft long term plan including the revenue and financing policy in the associated section 101 three considerations report for audit in terms of the section 10 13 report that 's been before you previously with workshops and tilly as part of that revenue and financing policy workshop I just wanted to draw your attention to the additions that I 've made which was the additions to the community outcomes and we 'd looked at that again in the past we had made reference to them but we 've decided to include them and foliar and we will also add another column to the tables which talks about which community outcome each activity primarily contributes to its the addition to those ones in terms of the draft long-term plan itself is to minor ages but i just wanted to three pages with these changes the first one is on page 11 and I 've got the amended page age 11 and 12 um the first change the wording etch the bottom of the paragraph that talks about looking after the SS we have whilst maintaining levels of service but the sentence used to say that the graph was just about showing the capex I 've actually made it more specific because now it talks about each group of activities and then you 'll note over the page is the graph itself is actually different and now it does rather than just following up all Catholics and renewal program it now shows that people expenditure split into the different groups of activities and then we 've created things that we 've been discussing through the workshop was actually around the volume of water versus this is the financial dollar amount so that waiting now reflects that and there 's some benefits to that and in terms of so for example of some particular year then that 's it other additional change just on that Ariel should we not specify that advisor only for period of three years yes we can edit so you will corn and I can 't remove an excuse my ignorance because i 'm got all these different community group or different service agreements listed here do we not have fun with the total sculpture trust and episode had a bit full off we do we 've got am where we hold a capital budget there 's a camera budget and operational and we have an MoU with the sculpture trust were says you can come into our sem we will consider an application under fifty percent funding of a particular site so we don 't physically at the start of each year give them cash and say go away and deliver so is that an is that ongoing like order that 's something that they may meet as a group to submit on i 'm sure they will all melon urltv that you 've been talking about it does have that moment on grapes think I look great three achieve this is just get wit not nervous 45 those dollars proposal for the golf club to go out I am is mine steam that comes out of the two and if any one person has to come over there so Pierce not like 's probably on budget to the stove rod Pierce let 's irrigate it to be what surge would that be discussed if it 's if it was an option it was discussed at the workshop whether or not you wished it to be in addition to the 231,000 or if you wanted to come out of the 231 out thousand own mind standing was that the consensus was for it to come out of the 2d 231 these 156 thousands of the restoration yeah just this clarifying that too aerial as it 's only if they need it you know obviously if it rains all summer they won 't need any water it 's right let 's bet pad the reason for changing to a volume-based rather than a dollar base I mean we 've hit to include we don 't need that in the F require I don 't_''_278.87 I think it required makes a little bit too I think it will be on a case-by-case basis because we won 't have an understanding of that until it but accuse all right okie dokie council Christos key just a first line we talked about this estimated that tablets usually resident population can increase by a maximum of seventy percent I would feel a little bit more comfortable if we were to delete the word maximum sorry wat patriotic you look h11 second paragraph first line a job what did you want it to say sorry I would feel more comfortable if we shall eat it the word maximum because you 're limiting yourself to what is actually an ax or could happen 215 okay here yes good thank you yes then another point if I may please on page 143 chillin just want to jump into over these pages we 're going to root page by page through this drive long-term plan I hope I think we 're just obviously we read it fine now so we 're just so it 's a 15 ish appear telling me there 's no changes in the script from the original draft plan that we 're given on that Thursday Darrell I responded yeah so what you will have noticed is that the version that came to you included the track changes the twenty-second of January so they are included in there will you there are other changes people that smoke track okay counselor Chris oscar 's got something but just one more page 243 the last paragraph second line we refer to under natural disasters to a volcanic activity but when just an the item bit previous to that on page six power 10 all we do is refer to a falling debris we don 't actually refer to any volcanic activity under natural disasters whatsoever should there be sort of some consistency and reference and alignment or whatever yep okay Nevers from even castle body I 'm gonna I believe this is the draft pain lanius 10 years and I believe you want to do due diligence and go through a page by page because there are figures that have changed and their script that has changed well it 's the job of this council I don 't care how long we 've had a job of this council is to go to the other characters we 've got a lot of page by page I suspect not so give we agree what some limits to do with script some of it is to do with the assumptions that because a certain percentage said they wanted an increase or a decrease particularly guards a destination great lake taupo it 's misleading to be sent out in that form because when you look at the deliberations report you actually find that the bulk of those are submitted that way were in fact tied up with destination or enterprise then if we root root through this page by page once i 'm going to do now you can go to ever cup of tea if you want to some of the wording things like keeping the rapes affordable what 's that actually mean we get back to the evil of the business about rate increases may not exceed the forecast local government cost index I thought we were meeting somewhere between that that 's on page 14 the business in regards to the tell fund I 'm standing with my argument the argument that I 've put up is that the 2.8 or three million we get an interest should be going three they 'll only equate to zero-point-three percent a year in regard to rate saving the figures i 've seen gives us another 5.5 million on that till fund so are we building have 5.5 million more on the telephone or 28 million more off our debt I think what you doing here can suppose you 're making statements as we go forward I walked about all these things just give us your changes have you 've got some changes or see the other counselors agree with them or not we 'll get them in the plan why your prep skin to the x1 gasps oh y 'all go to castor Collins oh yeah sorry John did you miss me oh I 'll just get big one more in John a break and councillor john on this piece a new heads me all right okay am I just had one one key question through the cheer thank you and our rate setting processes relying on two key documents the really on financing policy and our funding statements and we had a full legal review or someone to make sure that thing Thank You counsel honest counsel body in the draft document in regards of water we had the number of treatment plants around the lake this document states 16 the website we have says 18 which is correct sir well there 's a total of 19 if you count type or to learn your monkey no but 16 is the correct number well I mean the website accordingly the treatment of verb biosolids at view road site it could be a liability of 2.1 million for that is that in their draft budget now you 'll recall that we had that conversation about our view road which was that there are several options and we weren 't sure what was going to happen in terms of the current consent in whether or not the current can send holder would continue to hold that consent or whether we would have to look at other options so that information is a new so that when we come to that point in time we have further information we can include that in our annual plan without requiring and exceptions report to on that liability between now and 2020 five it may be depending on what the outcome of is with the current content holders continued desire I put some real concerns and regards of economic development to do with distillation greg lake taupo the figures that they produced show an increase of visitor numbers and three years of 50 something thousand to which we are going to spend over six million to achieve they 've already raised the euro results back in 05 06 we 're at the moment 64 million 69 million dollars behind in point four seven million visitor numbers behind 05 06 the other one to get more complicated mr. chairman because I do that to do with figures to say if it changes please page 86 finance class today the total total finance costs per year I believe a million if financial is always produced in gross see they live a million dropping down to six and a half million 15 when I mention about the changes in configures potential ones you 're appeared to be some changes in the prospective statement of financial position so do you want your page I 'm can I just threw the chair this comment that these this information is two people were deterred during currently and during februari and the final version but that water will be presented at the 25th of twenty four five februari so Victor getting the figures that are quite different from what we had 10 days ago ah not now concern mr. Crawford Jones making balance men also shown in close balance at end of 2025 and we 've since amended it to collect cash is Drew be payout in 2015-16 so accordingly the cash so that 's the statement of financial position that 's been altered there anyone else to pick that up so as I say old it will be siding off these numbers without going much further and mr. chairman I 'm concerned about the figures that we 've been given in regards of our debt repayment the egrets in this document don 't relate to the figure that we 're going to end up at this either this year which was 148 million it seems to be higher than that i 'm just 're just going to leave it to audit again so which pays to your eternity i 'm referring to a document that i received from minister ward in regards of a number of our cost centers and the repayments for this year starting with 165 million and ending up with 148 and when we went to him with the two lots of papers i had that were changed the comments were as a heads up the 17 million budgeted for deputy payments 1450 and include a one-off additional 10 million debt repayment now he did state that he would be sending me further information on that what I 'm doing is I 'm questioning we were going to be at the end of the shear versus in 10 years time at our 24 450 council meeting there will be a set of accounts for the six months ended june i say six million at december 2014 and a full cast for the remainder of the financial year so you 'll be able to then look at what our forecasted position is this what the original budget to position was so debt stated here is 16 1,000,000 either figures mr. Ward have given me a 148 it 's a large difference I 'm understanding is that it was the in your way yeah so it was yeah so that 's once again you will get to see what the forecast position is Lucy annual plan position and what we have to have and here is there are 14 15 annual plan numbers we cannot have our forecast 14 15 numbers so mr. chairman and it 's that you wish up this document is going out as a draft document with additional or new figures that again be given to us at the end of this month know that the numbers in there for 1415 are as peers of 14 15 and your plan the other thing mr. chairman is when I look at the information we have received in regards to our rate increases per year I have argued consistently that when we say our rates are going to be X we haven 't_''_1101.11 included in some cases the target of rates and it 's interesting that when you go and general rates going at 3.5 the sewer rate 23.4 and i believe the water skiing 5.3 I get nervous when we go to our ratepayers and tell them that this is what it 's going to be when I even film one property that will have exactly that it just might be me and now financials we show what our total rates requirement is for the year we show what percentage increase of that total rates requirement of versa previous year and then based on growth and rateable properties we then show what the percentage increase is on average residential oh sorry pure vapor across the district at council level that 's what your we can do is a number of sectors within the rating model whether it be dustrial commercial residential utility is a lot and to pick out an individual property years it will differ from what the averages but for a financial cooling purposes that 's what we 're required to do just a finish up mr. chairman and your worship we 've been told consistently that we cannot have differentials with the generators is that correct legal position and I 'm not prepared to add further comment to it what do you wish I buy in because I 've reported this council before what central otago does and I 'll brief you again be a general rate for several times prior acts as a catalyst want to hear what I what I want to establish from this council can we or can we not but differentials on generators yes or no the use of differentials is allowed under the right and policy it was extensively workshopped area would know the date so I am sure everybody knows the answer to that question it 's not the use of differentials that is the issue I believe cancer such the scale and the size of that differential that causes the legal issues that we have referred to you so therefore we can do it as long as the differentials are fair and reasonable we can do it absolutely and this council uses differentials to that effect not on the generators justice really cheered Mike just on that my concern just not the expert enter into the agreement with in a lil because you cannot treat 1 c1 c2 more flavor to another and that under the current their cable TV cable rating system there 's more that 's the way I see it procedural cat ate a guy do it jewelry very well during the workshop you were demonstrated that if you do change the differential by certain figure it will impact to certain sectors in different ways and you work your way through those those sums during that workshop process okay thank you finally mr. chairman on page 185 and I could be rolling this solid wastes I believe I i believe that the last graph and got and regards were clean thought that painful was a was eleven eleven dollars the new one stating 20 that wasn 't in the last draft the concrete okay finally I think there 's a spelling mistake of the bed with a chocolate privation adjustment yep 208 teen inflation adjustment leads an extra even be okay thanks buddy um erupted Oh case we made any changes out after there 's no changes here I think I suggested resolution there in and the adopted draft long-term plan thousand fifteen by the lamb please do by council Williamson seeking the broadcaster kruszewski thank you tumor notice then that the word fairness be removed out of the front page long term district strategy it 's takes about a new funding model to improve fairness there 's nothing fear in the new funding model it would shouldn 't be the whelp AG on page five so that 's it you 're here that 's your opinion there 's a pen my opinion I 'll stick to okay thank you has been moved and seconded well those in favor say aye aye those against carried item number eights draft long campaign consultation document for audit ill okay so this was a good fit was this is that we 're we talk about what does our community is going to be reading when there were out the constellation and so we talked through that with you at the workshop on the 26 20 second of January and we also get the revised version sorry for the trek changes vision coming it was about me see so accepted and there 's only two changes that I wanted to make to that version that got sent to you in those reflect the changes that we just talked about in the draft long-term and I 've got hey just here essentially look the same but i just wanted to provide them to you for completeness because it 's again changing that graph will cap it and also changing the wording for the gob club so that 's just for completeness that you need to get some copies of those funds other than that sorry okay other than that it would be great to get your thoughts and feedback and just make sure that everybody is happy with with what it 's saying and also just go through an e christian cydia but he has about the actual consultation process which again will be coming back here on the twenty four seven three worth the actual add item item agenda item to adopt or constipation so this is this is just adopting this document okay i think cereal um c 1 gummy bears on the layout and etc the other your photo no notice big medicine is level with Mark and I thought yeah well sure use it and Bradley Cooper 's not here this is true looking very smart all right has anyone got the questions or queries if you 're going to Christian regards of 817 I raised it before in regards of percentages being used in response to the options debate when no submitting will affect involved with the organizations and I don 't believe that the senator should be presented in this report was soaked aspect yeah what what was the ferry sorry you don 't what I 'm saying it is very misleading to use percentage figures of submissions that are made the nose making the submissions have an interest and listen what by submitting on ie if the chairman of enterprise great lake taupo makes a submission of favor of an increase he has or whatever the word is it 's very bad it 's like having enterprise great lakes in this nation great like tap i present to us that they want more manual for it to say the same and yet they can we go the public and say seventy percent or twenty percent decided on something when they actually have a vested interest or an interest it 's a responses which one that responses are the actual fact of the responses that 's how many more responses we got in so sorry that sort of get by you know so far I just gave Victor and that the third page so I 'm me and we 've got our one two three sort of five key things but and maintain the quality infrastructure that we have this repeated twice I think you okay and he was next cancer cousins through the cheer I just remember though we failed as last time on the when it comes to managing our net debt position I asked Lee rue the relative word and the some word for counsel and we agreed I thought but it still there so under merging on it Nick get position no taking notes I was thinking nice I did I did take notes but I also noted that it wasn 't generally supported so am i I didn 't make that tearaway page because it 's all about I was thankful there was them there but relative would mean were a little bit high and some would mean there are lots of other councils that are in debt we 're actually the Tama the wrong we are the second most in bit council in the country the last report I read it with the UM report emotional soon as night that we were released emergencies interest in the bay that we are but we 're up there though we offer her statement that they did I know I 'm just keeping it honest whoa engines adapter lowest i do yeah yeah okay um yeah those in thank you i 'm afraid the chair i just had a couple of points someone to make um first of all i 'm really pleased to see the grass it does capital expenditure fire activity that 's great I just wanted to take up on counselor bodies comment regarding the percentages because we sort of moved on from that I would have to agree with him that we need to note that these the reading it on the top face of it sounds like seventy two percent of everybody what 's this or want that that 's not actually the case that seventy two percent of those that responded I reading in the original and I would really I would really encourage it to go back please if we can on 85 22 I see that we 've taken out the treatment of the biosolids and I know we 've already had a conversation about that but I thought a key part of the consultation document was to highlight things of significance do we not think that if we have to spend 2.1 we need to signal that in the consultation document or if I got that wrong so we can put it back in this one I just think we have an obligation to to cite what might be significant and we seem to I 've got blue lines like it 's been taken sorry no it 's got 26 it sits and a dozen sorry and my 1 i 've got it out so it isn 't nothing yeah i would um and just in terms of the key pillars that we talked about I mean the acid test that i put through them when i reviewed whether they should be there or not as what are we doing why are we doing it and how we 're going to do that and I just get a little bit confused I mean we explain it further on the document but I 'm the first point maintaining the quality infrastructure that we have in terms of answering that what why and how it 's just a bit cumbersome because it is we 've got good quality infrastructure but we 're only going to renew it I just think I need some wordsmithing because does it make sense oh and the top one we talked about ensuring the top i district remains a great place to live why are we doing that we don 't_''_1906.559 I mean it 's just semantics but I just think we need to be really clear why we 've got that as a key focus why are we doing that help um I think that was that one want their take it out you do want are you suggesting i know i 'm not suggesting i 'm taking it out and what we need to what we need to say as our colors is what we 're doing why we 're doing it and how we 're doing it and we don 't actually address that acid test on that point do we and so you you wanted to annette first well this is my understanding was in that first paragraph we talked about total disturbs the great place love and why that 's important council wants to keep it where you want to add some more weirding around yeah why here otherwise it 's just a piece of dressing you know we all agree we want it to be a great place to live but if we 're following that form in of white okay thank you very much all right so just a resolution there oh just one other point swivel chair so um are we required by legislation to say tell people what our preferred option is yes yeah yeah that 's why I 'm well I know I don 't believe in have I just want to achieve this we have a legal requirement to state whatever the poodle okay thank you right I 've removed for that resolution think you can select rosovsky secondly counselor good back I think we 're as in favor please say aye I was against Kerry item number nine as in it standing orders amendment Oh Jane thank you very much right so this reporters read any pushing some changes through the chair just one question James for clarification if I entered this council meeting via video so I constitute powder before no one has to be present okay look at the other job eh all right yeah constant I oh so I 'm me and number one is and we do we have no money allocated in the next 10 years for any sort of upgrades whatsoever and secondly as being a part of the former trainee and we had a member that spent some time in Christchurch and did try to come in via and sort of conference like who whatever sort of link it was blocked off half the public and it was um it was some sort of sound delay there was something happening which caused a lot of disruption to me so I 'd therefore and will be voting against this resolution and I 'll just i was here at that meeting and i was sitting in the audience and there 's also confusion about who was actually talking because rob williams was away at the same time and so people thought it was robbed talking and not the other were talking and and where you could hear was his child playing in the background and it distorted the whole thing and i cannot agree with okay we 'll just add this is just changing Standing Orders we quite categorically state in the paper that we don 't think new technology is there were to actually do this so so Jane just to make one other point I believe if you want to stand for council and you want to put your best foot forward for the community venue tune up in your g the job person and don 't take the shortcut the safety of your own home can I ask one more question if you 're doing it that way and you 're not part of the Quorum dare get a vote no cuz i am you you have to be present to you I present you here this is this basically government direction that needs to go into standing orders is beyond the area where will we do it or not so this is just basically trying to keep with the times so yeah we quite categorically realize that our technology one doesn 't help the setup of this room doesn 't help and but this isn 't to stop you even going down into the Talpiot room and having a little teleconference but again you 're not allowed to do it for hearings so anything very important you are still not allowed to use I 'm the technology could be quite handy in the odd committee meeting or something like that so yeah it 's just so i just want to point you wish it and 2.20 of the recommended resolution i think there 's a slight typo its look I think my periods feeling let 's come from the agency bellisario Santa blush uh mr. Jones I mean this is just a really a piece of housekeeping it 's not about muscle diving off over the country to remotely Lincoln in a if we 're part of a corner when you need to vote then you 'll be present and in the year and a half I 've been here we 've had pretty much full attendance at all these council meetings of all these counselors so I think it 's a red herring to say that but it 's just as just a piece of housekeeping is nothing yes acknowledging that our technology is not up to scratch we have a renewed oh yeah okay what dates it 's right yeah 22 ok shiny you want yeah and that 's 20 sympathy buried amid some totem is anyone available to go to that comes back Vicki so we 're there to the resolution jimin 's there is no meeting this Thursday at ten o 'clock don 't do with communities Thursday okay I 've got a calendar got something I Camp David number two on februari to twentieth nineteen it what that wasn 't this when you talking about night council would eat cancer on the first is it I mean Thursday 's the fifth year here knows nothing nothing here I 've got um I do and support a council body up at our neighborhood review it was one partners reviews 10 sorry don 't you like it yeah oh ok sorry I wasn 't clear only one sorry all right thank you and so the suggested resolution near 12 and a new three that counselor pack attend design to meeting take your counsel back door it into that and like the move for that resolution please cancer cousin singing about cancer strewth thank you very much Rosenthal EP so I hide against Kerry item the 12 members reports and yeah so they 'll just be handed them these two _"

Louis just a point of clarification on for bar 12 under policy implications audit New Zealand reviewed aspects the am pleased with a particular focus on us in wastewater was there any particular reason or comments while the focus was on those two key areas yes that is ben harper and for government and whoever most water looks were those two were chosen are there any comment I mean other any comments that you need to bring this there was no significant comments received an order of the apps thank you bracelet my I have a number of queries and somebody hadn 't slowed us on on full bar for it states at the Talpiot Township where he has 10,000 856 residentials or writable property sorry under under our water on for about twenty one that has 10,000 423 I assume that persons that except some of course would have the second tanks that 's not the reason of the correct okay Nikki you have a queries a few coming up okay yessums chillin on for about 19 when we look at our proposed budget for the transport and I assume that this document is going forward from now fessor july to 24 25 you have the poha p road widening and the seal extensions as i was at 1.57 and 3.35 or 3.75 let me go to page 43 of our long-term plan it actually has a higher figure it actually has the ceiling that over road widening 1.7 and I 'm sorry probably wrote writing one of them 3.8 and the other the ceiling is some 1.7 it shows in the 1415 year mine or safety works is 174 the document on page 4 119 shows minor works 169 earth and your average but that 's not shown in the long-term plan the valve is that over asset management plan around and floated the funniest in the long term plan our inflated okay so that 's the reason for those two differents at the moment would not have the inflation figures the asset management plane do some fellow members and say that when you looking back you 're looking at the actual costs rather than the inflated number and we build the inflation inflated numbers you into the long-term plan yes all of them sent sorry you know in a way to be here like there 's more district this probably far beyond annoyed system the you know Claire for cash with regarding and the expense degress the executive summaries on paid for by taxes depreciation is included in the operational expense or costs on page 44 flee enormous and the wood for the property property asserts that doesn 't creep does include depreciation 449 I don 't the check their way so buddy to the lab for bath 49 and I my fellow councillors will help you out for about forty nine about the Turing service delivery relocation of the Turing offices in Turing eyesight I can 't remember talking about the relocation of the officers down at one stage we 're looking to expand so what 's the reason for it 's cream so I don 't have a blue tarp knowledge of the building here it 's there is there a story a project and your long-term plan to look at the different buildings down there so that 's this that 's a new long-term plan which is where this will have come from so somewhere in a long-term plan someone give me the page we should be if we allocated funding for that well no do you have an assister project number of years the restroom yeah on none for bar 55 its state some and the bottom of the page on point 176 the installation of an irrigation system tongariro north to Maine 100,000 next year and a hundred thousand the year after and your page 51 of our one of our long-term plan States 15 16 20 grand and sixteen seventeen eighty twenty thousand and a t-1000 following year there 's a reason for those because of the go to floor bar 56 there 's a difference between the minguk enter public conveniences 141008 the long-term plans stating 144,000 I think I can answer the question and the state hundred and forty-four thousand so that 's 141 for the lakefront toilet renewal replacement and it and 3,000 for rats and mice if you like for repainting and minor works in a minor key no area we would have been in that document which should be extra 3000 looking at eight generations for I didn 't pick it up in the LTP it may well be there i reversed 144,000 you 're looking at on paid for by 56 of a pro gender 441 yep and in the LTP document new toilets mega Kenai 144 for the next year stamina quick look at the Knights Templar so 3 30 second thrilling nettlesome sign as though yeah so he 's wrapped up in something else the three thousand three news yes yeah that 's when you should be under in your smoke so they the additional 3000 will be for other projects in their area for in your projects so it 's actually shown as part of the figures that we have in front of us at the moment it 's included in 144,000 good question sure yes 3 is under works I guess what is trying to do is for the k1 perhaps when you three thousand dollars three cousins all 's well yeah I think listen is castle expediency just done can we come with them if you want particular query can we get a gyro perhaps a typical answer of me instead of just you know earlier probably just to love you another question jump well just a new job sorry with the irrigation one work shown 100 grand for two years yet shown in the long term clean 20 and a t-1000 on page 4 x 57 the talks about renewals from the irrigation and yet we 're putting in a new system on 4 x 55 that 's a an era that 's not what was in the executive summary and it wasn 't_''_968.27 in the last draft either yes this what what 's happened is that that project has been pushed back a year from the 15 16 year to the 16 17 year in order to provide some additional funding for the projects that were brought forward so that should be 1617 that project well it does but it makes the figures 4 15 16 hour per 100 grand without any other your are a few other might and minor ones where one was 35 is shown in the document on to pianist 36 so fit to be those figures and not the long-term plan figures will be i think the long-term plan figures are inflated and others are not information well the long-term the discrepancy it at may be explained by inflation the long-term plan is showing 20 thousand fifteen sixteen 81,000 which gives you your total 100 but we still have stairs and out somewhere just just one room with the long-term clean up in the end of the bar of those figures are correct not an issue but if we really miss that 's in conjunction with the long-term plan or the fittest man 3 my query is never threw it sure that the long-term plane is the actual numbers this so the long-term plan is survived it 's a lot depends what 's going to happen the amp is what we as staff so you should be the off the long-term plan doesn 't exactly reflect our recommendations in so be it I get a little bit confused because at least two drafts ago they 'd mentioned 100 it 's only two second to last draft and in the long-term plan that 's now broken it up into the two years so I 'm just I just struggle with figures that change and I 'm not quite sure why they do the only reason it 's it 's not over two years it should have been shifted from one year to the other that hasn 't been accurately reflected and this was under green yet shouldn 't have been split up over two years I mean through the chair I can see that an era has just been made in transcribing I guess it 's just getting the level of confidence so it 's been captured correctly in the LTP numbers would that be correct okay this poem is mr. chairman assist this is to do with the wording if we go to for by 59 total expenditure across all categories since the headline of the graphs categories so that 's still supposed to be there or not all right the one on page 4 66 on I 'm wondering whether the words are saying the same thing once his total expenditure across all categories the other she has time to predict that expenditure spend illusions that that whole sections been struck out I would have been helpful that had a blue line through all the right items okay thank you all right okay any other questions got somebody but right okay thank you very much and have a questions or queries of mr. Lewis Thank You Allison okay suggested down reservation there now the estate management plans for a word of transport wastewater solid life stormwater properties and facilities and packs and reserves be adopted way about Castle William since even about counselor body all those in favor say aye and it goes against carried _"

    "text": "okay i will go to cancer number 10 item number teen council body with notice of emotion here that 's the body the opportunity to then mr. chairman for some considerable time they I 've argued in this chamber that I do not believe that our treasury management should be involved with investing rate payers money which we in fact the trustees often in the in the share market no one has accepted my arguments I decided to actually register my concerns by bringing this motion before council I believe that we should seriously consider the roots of investing in that market through the treasury management document which we 're going to adopt I think this was like prudent investments and words along those lines if we 're going to prudently invest I believe it should be outside the shear market because of the risks associated is my resolution actually has saved my wording to it I 've accepted that we have had some very good returns in that market I 'm not disputing that but I don 't believe as trustees of ratepayers money we should can continue investing it we have a seconder it 'll see local councillor cousin it 's okay anyone else want to speak speak for the motion can I ask what what is an alternative I believe if you read the report that we have received there are a number of investments that we have this relates specifically to the tell fund investments which are in the share market thing called a bank okay subsequent to receiving a notice of motion I sort illegal devices to possession of counsel and I read your cuppa paragraphs from that legal advice first unless there was a compelling reason for acting contrary to such a compulsory policy which is what the treasury management policy is under local government act we are required to have a policy of us nature the council will almost inevitably lose any judicial review challenge to a decision or one was bored and that is because you cannot make a decision of this magnitude without going out for a public consultation and all the facts to being considered the second real risk is that of the personal liability for the councillors themselves what be more likely to be found at a council acted contrary to its own adopted policies and then suffered a loss from selecting this particular point of time the because of the downturn in the mining industry the world the change to the Greek government affecting the Euro market etc the I 'm new eyes lost and oh so time realized is about nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars so what this legal advice is saying is that should counsel make a decision today to leave away equity investment I either they were sold there is a very strong chance that the counselors will be personally liable to reinvest at nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars through the chair i would i would say it to me it 's been here that 's rather scare tactic because well i don 't think we 're suggesting that we dump them on the market today we have to be a planned exit to get the best return I don 't that 's rather alarmist well sorry but that 's what the motion on the table is that council removes its investments and _''_261.26 and I suppose a citizen to before that it 's not about faith or anyone 's ability at all in this process as it core as it good for councils we invest in the stock market I 've serious a lot online and see what other councils are doing and these argue a lot of arguments for there 's a lot of arguments against and I think we 've managed with a managed exit strategy no one 's going to the court in question is you have a treasury management policy which has an investment strategy to move away from that investment strategy you need to go out and do a full public consultation as far as your Treasury Minister policy is concerned which involves a new investment strategy quite a complicated process that 's behind it currently the treasury management policy has been reviewed by PricewaterhouseCoopers as we 've previously advised to and it 's not when you 've got such an important policy and there 's a range of them you cannot under that the local government act just go and act against your policy there is a that we haven 't got process to be able to do you cannot thank you cannot just um go against your treasury management policy it and one okay one other point too is that you have to also consider what the that you actually removing the delegated authorities that exist within that treasury management policy as well what I would ask so you are stating that there is no exit strategy for us from that there is an exit strategy and respect of all our equity investments when we invest that nurses process not policy we have an exit strategy and you 've seen that operating as per that to love previous equity investments of giving you I think the extreme situation as to the investment of the National straily at bank which will s you hear it for seven days because within seven days the share price rose to the level that our exit strategy identified when we originally took those shears out as far as our current shareholdings are concerned there is a exit strategy yes on each of those investments but we will be reinvesting into the million in the to your phone dear it 's 5.7 million invested inequities I do not prescribe that as being a high-risk scenario y que el dia point yep would be can we when we 've made a profit on certain city shares sell them up and not reinvest that money back English your market compromising 33 there have been times used when we 've had no equity investment but is the market there 's attractive enough to potentially get some gain out of an investment of that nature then we will go back into that market but it 's not strategy to say we want to have ten percent or twenty percent or thirty percent of the fund that listed on that market so as I say at times like when the global financial crisis hurt we had no equities at all because of the market was just not setting the right signals okay hey Scott 's no thank you just maybe I thought I give my legal opinion so we know where we stand council John 's i think was next um I guess for me in many egg I think we need to go back and and we 've got the treasury management policy we need to discuss I 've got some points I want to bring up when that comes up as an agenda item whether that 's in a draft or whether we 're adopting it because we have not cited the price waterhouse cooper will change it I personally don 't have an issue with worth having some of our TL fund and shares but I think we need to have an opportunity to discuss our treasury management policy and its performance without feeling like we 've been closed down or all the risk of liability church and us as counselors that is to me bit of a ski tech tonight not sure that that 's appropriate in the system can surpass us key ug sorry did you head no no no no exact against I have any of you like sorry ok we 'll hear cancer Abby I just wanted to ask is there a certain level that we invest of thumbs and end please '_''_579.47 like you mentioned about five million or us to and this is being the case before I arrived that you can have up to fifty to sixty percent of your investments and equities so you couldn 't take test 30 million currently apologies for the insects to be about 5 or 0 depends on as a weird being as low as zero when I came on board there was some way around fifty percent of the t.o fund inequities because the market was Peter because it was outsourced than the external managers saw that is the right strategy we 're taking a far more conservative approach since we pulled it in-house counsel it back I think you your worship I 'm not taking away from you Alice rule I 'd really value your opinion in your expertise but Rob is the council 's chief executive the policy states you have overall responsibility for their councils operation are you comfortable with the current policy it that okay I 'm in a clarification before I wind up Mr Man Hamlet 's mentioned legal advice etc etc etc I got the impression from what he stated that if we wanted have to go to consultations that correct that 's correct if that is the case why then has this along with a couple of other issues not been on the agenda to be discussed for the draft long-term plan Oh a few times and also if the changes that you 've got in front of you of the Treasury membership policy are quite insignificant changes this is a significant change that you are proposing to the whole treasury management policy in the investment strategy for this council and this investment strategy has been in place probably for the last 15 years so you are proposing a significant change which would require the full consultation process as far as the community is concerned you just wanted to confirm we have discussed this several times before do yep could you refer to win those specific discussions took place please in our workshops hero and did it and did at that time do we debate this issue or did counselor just make comment on it remembering there was no boating taken because of any straw votes and if they were exes before council explained how it worked and where you 've mentioned it before yourself that you 're not no support table their particular time so it definitely traversed the subject before ok well there 's a motion on the table John council room suite really so your employee thanks really I do support the well we are printing the next item on the agenda with the children poor so I Prince wad ye support the young call sears at the strategy the OS ESO sustains I was so very respected council body I can 't_''_809.29 agree with VI using the word Paddington in the risk a little it 's not being present because I know these mention the Treasury policy has diminished mister mister measured mantra manager and if responsible way and give touching and counsel Pikes and I think the strategy being adopted and the CEOs the employer and use the instant the employees comes an operational manager and Americo with invade things don 't go well rule will roll its own vote but I believe I 've just northeast of you off complete confidence another Paul CSS dance Thank You McKay it 's been very by Councillor body singer by Councillor cousins I could I have a show of hands the motion please those against the motion nation has lost the call for a division please council body against cousins for balance against names have to be recorded yeah hello voted wasn 't item number 65 sorry 35 we offer here time 19 okay hero adoption of the trio jury management on the seat thank you I just wanted to clarify and a point because you will have noted reading through reading through this item in terms of the treasury management policy mr. me here is correct when it comes to significant changes you must consider those in the context or through engagement in consultation with our community and the proposal are the proposed to changes that are sitting within this policy as it stands our very modern nature and the Act allows you to adopt those minor changes without without consultation so it is around significance and you 'll know that that 's contained in our significance and engagement policy you 'll also feel the note of it that includes the options around the TL fund because that 's moving away from what we 've traditionally done and looking to have a change okay thanks hero and we 'll have any questions or queries from material cancel Johnson I 'm through the q thank you um area I that was one thing I needed to clarify whether you are asking us to formally adopt the TMP or whether you 're asking adopted as a graph to go out against consultation as part of the auto protein I I just wanted to draw our attention to a couple of key points and firstly we say that our TMP needs to be consistent with our LTP and our objectives and i do question whether it 's correct process to have formally adopt this right now when part of changes teknion regard to the te l fund going out for consultation I don 't believe that we should be adopting a policy that we are actually going out for consultation on I note that you say that the changes are insignificant I 'm sorry I were as a ever elected member would 're dealing with in Te elfin and what we want to strategically do with that moving forward so I believe that a significant now the second point I want to make and when the truck not troubles me but we have yet to receive your price waterhouse cooper report which is an order of the performance of the TMP policy as well as various other things and how we dealt with you don 't measure in the past I don 't believe from the government government sponsorship prudent for us to approve a TMP policy until we 've had the chance to review that ourselves as elected officials I note that mr. Fox is here there is nothing of significance to come out of that price waterhouse cooper report but i cannot approve anything that i have not had a chance to review yet or talk to Price Waterhouse Cooper about I think we 've got our process of and roll on this one your comments various questions cereal do you want to answer in your later on sorry you 're talking to another fight and they 're at a guess one of the things we need to think about in terms of the treasury management policy is that at all times you must have a treasury management policy in place you don 't you can amend that Treasury monetary policy at any time so for example if we adopted it today and the price waterhouse cooper a review comes back you review that and you want to make further changes to your policy then you can do so if you so wish and that 's why we had put the paper forward as adopting the treasury management policy is it as it stands again you would also be able to change that following your choices for the final long-term plan we 've got other policies in front of us that where I 'm passing as drafts but we 're not fully adopting I don 't see why we can 't but you can change it anytime yeah so text by that yes down what is the matter part of the order and Russell committee what sort of cheer on the basis that most of these changes are implementing the are the intention is that it really kicks off from the first of July I don 't have an issue in the fearing the adoption of it until um we get those boxes ticked just to clarify I don 't we 've already got there is an adopted policy at the moment you will go to karin-sama so now I 'm obviously at the moment I say the only changes in this is the local government well usually they changed the wordings around the borrowing limits and the the measurements that we currently use as you would see by our current treasury management policy the we showed both the local government funding agency requirements and our existing truly measurement ones we are adhering to the local government funding agency ones and we temporary breach one or two with our existing so this is really updating those particular aspects of our treasury management policy if it 's deferred it makes no difference to our ability to do our job because we do have a current treasury management policy but what we 're doing is really bring it up to speed with you saying you want to change the writ meter resolution to defer table it what are the other cancers feel I would support cancer jolin suggestion I just desert effective CEO doesn 't affect our timelines but we just want to raise the issue that so one of the things that what it does is they look when they look at our consultation document is look at the underlying information used to prepare that and the treasury management policy is one of those so my preference would be that we still adopted it today but we adopted and draft that way it gives it the ability to look at there because it wrap it up as in it and then you can make any further changes along the way understanding of the processes that we adopt it as a draft the in order will look at it as part of the conservation okay I me now so Jones be happy to move that as a draft yep cool Thank You cancer cousins disorder before the vote gets put just one one thing I noticed on page five bar six which corporates lined out that 's just an update of titles what I thought it might be scented with a pay increase but no thats it paid reduction on a year when are you snap an extra word and here in earliest pay because i 'm virtually further on corporate sleep than that it 's not not consistent oh you mentioned about nothing of significance I 've got the last long term plan borrowing limits 3.9 which is only a few sentences 3.9 in the new one before it is quite quite large and I still haven 't got my head around what the significant changes are and the borrowing limits the major change there is aligning our policy with practice and respective borrowing from the local government funding agency and other forms of borrowing and really giving a definition of net D Fisk roast it well yes we talk next external debt as a new compared with the old one we didn 't refer to net debt on the alibi this one right as you 're seeing a consultation document is this references to net debt and things of that speed with where we are a circle council given one of the things of the report states is reporting reporting to can 't see monthly Treasury reports we haven 't had the monthly we did purchase a mophie treasury report and of course following the end of the financial year this was a gay but from mainly our December council meeting we tabled a monthly and you will have a monthly till the for the first six months the year tabled at the fiddly twenty-first of every meeting ended yeah okay it does further before we do anything whether can I ask Ben Hannant we had the 20 million of 25 million with that bbb+ rating which was another resolution I brought before this council that proceed with it because apparently that no longer exists and create you were you passed a notice of motion and regards to that which is not on the agenda solely because two weeks before you pass seen that and we actually sold the NZ corporate bond maybe it 's a breakdown of lines of communication but yes we got rid of that and we registered banks at different maturity dates where we decide what the long-term investment will be for that 20 million in their ratings on those are the relays that aids or a la plus they 're they 're registered banks the issue we have is because of the lack of corporate paper that 's available in the market that we are getting up near the limits of our investments and to individual banks well if we 're going to further discuss our policy the previous council by resolution changed the rating of investments to that BBB+ as that resolution still stand as part of our policy they made that change in respect that one investment that they approved the retention of that investment subsequent to its drop and grading it was nothing apart from that one investment and as I say we do not hold an investment now thank you thank you again sir john 's some move the amended resolution secretive by Councillor cousins I 've ever discussion cancel Chris us ki just a couple of questions first of all that the resolution resolution wouldn 't need to be amended a second thing is that and within the policy within the draft policy refers to a couple of times to an annual plan on the process of procedural basis are we expecting to go through annual plans so watch the action l requires you still have to produce an annual plan it just depends on if their changes are so significant or and require through the consultation that you 'd have to then go out and consult on those still have to me I 'm sure enough against oh those are both the council can have an independent trustee do we have one for the beans your benefit alright don 't have an outside we don 't okay all those in favor please say aye is against carried item number six draft rates remissions and postponement policies you these will be aware so these are just a game part of it sweep of Reclamation and we held workshops on the Russians policies and we took you through the existing ones and including the discontinuation of the transitional returns policy which was fast fires it jun 2015 in the addition of disasters brights remission that 's good cuz I was just going to and just physically comment there yeah absolutely delighted that national disasters that are going to be read and recognised in these policies it 's the emergency news which here in don 't like to move the suggested resolution thank you cancel but I 'm in deep resolution you can sir cousins so I just want to go home sixth power 9 what this is Marty freehold mean multi ownership what is the determination of multi ownership how many I 'm not the expert on their particular area of remission but I my understanding would be that would be two or more but I don 't not have to clarify that was tiny and get back to you sorry good tonight what you understand it needs me to do with us to find under in terms of the title ok cancel just tusky to hit thank you your worship just a couple of things and under six power one under the discussion points we refer to a transitional remissions policy but in fact there is no reference within the a transitional remissions policy so should there be any reference whatsoever of there in the policies themselves ya know because that one 's been removed so should that not state that no I wouldn 't have thought so because what we 're saying is that here are our new policies when you look at the consultation document your notes that it talks about that change which is when we go to consult we 'll talk about it with the community but your policy your policies should state what your actual policies are going to be but if you currently have a policy and you 're going to delete it or get rid of it should you not state that we have started yeah through the chair so I think that policy lapses in July so we 're not deleting it we 're just letting it lacks is that clear is that correct for this rides and have a relation to clarify builder but the resolution will unit lacks but when it 's filtered by the consultation document I was just going to clarify that in the last rhenium we did level that it was not at right to extend it so it is it has infect it does not it 's us to thank you what then moved by Councillor back I have a second the police Thank You cancers to it _"

for that thanks counselor pack seemed to buy counselor Declan all those in favor say aye ministerie very building I will go quickly back to number thirteen they 're really had a clear regarding the resolution section 4 of the resolution there 's no issue and removing those words it 's a real belt and braces Clause just covering everything and we 've just checked through in there 's no issues of the words that will rely on elected members general knowledge and understanding of and governor code to the vets removed it 's not mushy so those councils that we prepared to argue against a decision but Simpson Greece and again a reconsider sometimes Grayson have said that it 's not going to undermine the rest of the resolutions of effect particular senators remain it was here and right because I think it changes engineers common with many views maybe just take the Wiz preferences there but we 'll need any problem communities because obviously we have to listen anyways I mean say after brilliantly decisions for you tune but if this does go on with the okay well castle body suggested the amendment of the resolution and you moved that 2g that 's great that you have drivers singing that all right against the Justice keep all those in favor please say aye I is against Kerry no just opened another theory yeah yeah yeah okay number three item number sixteen members reports they can be full version and modem to the front maybe Maggie and that 's for sure I just like to say that um I think to the local government Christopher Lee from the community board when in the woods was amazing family we won the Leadership Award with it well that 's just so great but then we got the supreme award which was just like as first time the birds put in for the ward into when both was amazing and unless say that the staff did an amazing job throughout the whole of the projects that we put together and without them it would have been a possible task because they their input was really valuable and it helped us immensely to achieve what we achieved and the rest of the workshop I went to one of the workshops i went to i was very disappointed and it was building strong relationships with community boards and Mellie and I really with high hopes because we are strengthening our relationships and working with eerie end happen and it was the rest of my time person and i have put reflective that in my feedback to them we all went to another I didn 't go to the lucky one because we had such a what did you go coromandel yes commander I thought I really wanted to go to that workshop instead and I got some really really good theory out of it for the community board we 're working really well with our community to get our the community using and input into the community and I feel that we actually need and I think with counselors that have been to the board meetings but i feel that i 'd like to see the opening of the board and councils link and I have some ideas of how we can look at doing things like that and I will take that with the to the board at their mating and bring that forward through through the board level and looking forward to the price we won because we run a local government and one of their workshops they know how workshops a free workshop and for up to 20 people so we 'll be having discussions about what we 're going to do with it as well and it was just really worth going I thoroughly enjoyed it and thank you for the opportunity I don 't 20 people yes so I 'm wondering whether the board would consider inviting the wider council remote thank you for that can sister any other I got Sir John 's just a question for Maggie hope so actually wrote the report Maggie because that 's a real talent in itself to write those and it was put together day Oh Cornelia wasn 't at camellia dancing and she 'd she did learn amazing journey because that that 's half though yeah it was here I did a copy along with me in case anyone hadn 't seen it i 'll leave it here for you and she was so did her because i got a call from lick the chair of the the chair of the Energy Board exact whatever there and he asked if we could take a something along to put up to show the others and what we were doing without the women back at that stage wouldn 't know if we burn anything or not because the others were sold as well and Cornelia was just there it was done it was the size i could amazing one woman and I when you take my head off to her great thanks Maggie all right any other oh and thank you tema yes I haven 't_''_488.72 you know I just mention something and I 'm on the board was of the rips of the citizen base Bureau yeah and obviously it 's run by volunteers and they run it almost like a business they go in and out and they spend a lot of their personal time they get a grant from the council but almost all of that has taken up in the event that they pay is there anything that can be done that has changes that or is that just the way it is is that they stuck with that that I 've learned meeting with them boy get business after five and two long you last night we can income they provide part of their community link rooms for citizens advice and various groups for nothing to do their part of why or a house you see and they pay rent to all right so it seems a bit strange to me that they can apply to and they would just need to do you don 't go through the process as we we obviously given to granting can use that for administration things like that so they do well they use that towards administration by the sound of it yeah the grant we give them is it right yeah leader from the ground to set with Bill Graham that they apply to a FireWire house I am but is a very pretty of other opportunities for from other grants to be able to and support them if they wanted to do that and certainly and my team could help them with those applications may use an expert on this term I was cheered them too many citizens must be or four years and there are other funding strains that you can go through to get funding there 's bay trust these cogs is fluttering it 's under and through them a lot obviously because I we might survive but what some other funding we looking at mosi for or just for them you know they obviously do apply to other funding areas get it on one hand but they have to give it back the others what they say mm-hmm so it 's just the nature like a lot of those organization they will see everyone does it coming lower house is a hub concept for social services it 's the the rinks and tip that the tenants pay that keep that building functioning it doesn 't make money it 's about being able to provide and service so then if they want to be part of that they have to take part in paying the other and they do in a community with a service opportunity you said all the other groups that are in there but yeah there 's any specific requests they want you know we 'll try and help the money right Devon is to go panic well suit cancer body up so have you bringin soliciting funds you at the moment take the might be of some other ideas yeah all got different organizations we know about okay what thank you and suggested resolution there thank you can sir john 's singer by castle back all those a resolution to yep I 'm gonna break good idea we 'll move into confidence near with the items coming up how could I even move the police for the reasons outlined thank you can 't add me by council bodies signify council of Jones all those are faithfully so I against ok ok father away

policy 2015 hero today I just want to talk to you before we get into this package of agenda items which are all related the long-term plan adjust I guess put a bit of a a bit of where we are on the journey around it and so today as a milestone in our ten-year journey we 're up to the food a theory which has been a day on the calendar for me personally for a long time because it 's about getting things to audit and that 's always a great a great step in our in moving the 2013 running throughout 2014 and it 's start of 2015 we 've developed the draft long-term plan and we 've developed a consultation document we 've repaired all the underlying information including the development contributions policy the asset management plans the treasury management policy the river in financing policy the rates remissions and postponement policies in the significance and engagement policy we held the options debate and September which provided an opportunity for our community to let us know I thought about a range of issues from water housing for the elderly economic development and whether or not to charge for library books over a thousand people provided feedback on it which gave us a strong steer about the Preferences of our community and have helped you shape the draft long-term plan in the consultation document you 've made a number of choices in decisions which have created this draft planning consultation document we 're forecasting low rates increases between two point two one and two point seven three percent over the life of the ten-year plan we 're reducing debt and we are maintaining levels of that we 've used to repeat a consultation document what it assesses that underlying information is part of the audit of the consultation document and the order focus is ensuring that the purpose of the consultation document has been meet which is to provide an effective basis for public participation and local authority decision-making processes relating to the content of a long-term plan part of that process is assessing the quality of the information the assumptions that we have used on completion of that order as you know and we will be making any amendments that are required will include those in the documentation that comes to you on the twenty-fourth of februari on that date we will also adopt the development contributions policy the revenue and financing policy the rates for missions in postponement policies and the consultation document for consultation and that consultation period runs from a secret of march to the sea month of april there are a few minor changes that I 'll take you through some of the documents and when we get to them and but now I 'll hand over to as Jane contributions policy and then I 'll come back for the other ones what would this be the amendment to attachment to what we measure to and these amendments to item number be very minor I don 't know what I 'm saying what document are we going to be looking at is we have a number it 'll be a development contributions policy now which is number three leah yes i 'll pay off okay happening less hi I 'll take the report is read the only things I will kind of note is you will have noticed a change in style to the policy so this is the new Waikato collaborative policy that we were basically putting all of our policies into and as part of the new policy and it 's not really a new policy has just been changed the font instant and is the new maps from the elbow and recharges are also included is pure our workshop that we held couple of weeks ago okay that 's what did you wanna say no you 're right any questions or queries on that okay circus asking type of town wastewater service catchment I 'm notice that the new for a walker subdivision is not included in that is that a mistake or ok so that tape indicates one yeah okay right thank you yeah it 's just because you 've got that on the on the previous map you 've got it included we 're probably looking at the airport not throw water okay the answer cancer cousins cheers just that I never actually got to read the growth model review which is the outsider you will escape but I noticed one is 3.32 they talk about we obviously we base our decision making of the information contained in this document it 's got the southeastern growth theory of multiple i would order to watch took wanted a heater and hot chick me see that large largely residential with a significant portion of holiday homes that 's actually in Reverse at sibley percent holiday homes and thirty percent payment residential I think Larry does impact on after you should it and that type of late so I 'm sure council has true or figures but that can scroll to my page number on it that 's up and the growth model with you the abbot 132 this paragraph we talked about water water service in in the future and the costs and having gone through the multiple one recently the biggest resistance was from holiday home owners so it 's really crucial we have our facts right we come to regard ownership of properties because holiday home owners won 't want to be paying for infrastructure I think through the cheer that sentence if I reader says these years are predominately residential with a significant proportion of holiday home yes but I we just as a are we there has been that desperate residential living and it 's not for their means is that predominantly its houses in most of those houses are residential okay we can we can clean them only one service of them if we 're basing our decision-making on that let 's talk to me that 's the way it read was that they 're living as the proportion of the house where it is mostly holiday homes sorry I asked but clarified a little bit just in terms of the growth model in the DC policy which all unconnected is a separation between what what is residential in terms of code of practice levels what 's wrong what 's commercial was industrial next we it 's coming from I was mostly on further for me in down the road trip was that the Holy homeowners they will become a self-extracting payments and we know from which were they are most resistance has been have some impact of us so I 'd be pedantic and also i will say is that I 'm take on the growth model and what of consider the tombs those those percentages and where those flows come from and where the growth comes from in those year as well so yeah it 's all interconnected okay this any other questions let 's get our on the grocer body on the growth model it 's quite fascinating reading unfortunateiy it up numbered but if we go to economic overview one to third pagan it mentions about low unemployment as well as the wealth of the veiny baby boomers we read the next page over that she states the trend to standard work fears for longer is becoming more apparent as baby boomers call back the losses in the financial markets this loss of world has had a negative impact on demand of residential properties contradicting the page before that there 's a lot of assumptions in here that I believe should be removed their assumptions only yummy a keeper a pair of your growth model and Tommy economic model as you have to you do after a law on assumptions you 're looking we 're forward-looking not backwards looking and I think one of the issues we 've had in the past as we 've looked too much backwards pr4 Reviver astute we 've made assumptions on our growth going forward that we 're agreed you do need to make a substance and I would hope that you when you read through that you could understand the assumptions of made and your kids see the figures that we 've come to at the end of it there has to be assumptions made with directional going forward achieving it how do that as buildings people leaving existing buildings and moving to new premises there 's a mexican is expected in yeah oh that 's from it might find billions of people shut then far that 's from new growth permits from new businesses coming to town needs to be the whole mix out here okay there any other questions I mean comment that i found the growth model review very interesting and very informative and very useful thank you so kruszewski i might have missed something but as regards to may we look at the overall growth model minka kino doesn 't seem to be featuring i know it 's not a growth mode that should we not be at least acknowledging it so this is difference between growth a difference between development so making there 's a lot of bacon sections making lot of existing capacity into it so we when we look at the growth model there 's a couple of different factors are looking at one is the financial implications so we don 't get new rate payers by some of the building on the new get more flour and water or wastewater that hasn 't already been provided for so you 've got a separate waters new growth and what is just development that 's happening okay thank you for that the DC can only be related to the growth component of anything so okay thanks watching to didn 't a PO East which area is that that highway five on your part tapping oh we don 't have a tap of a story well it 's on top ourself with the highest population and then also on the page average pink population weld if he had some page numbers I think that might be able souvenir I 'm sorry catchment perspective we don 't have a select a base that 'll be there 's probably more from the their census data yeah okay just to finish off with another little bit of a dig about the baby boomer will one would expect with a reduction wealth in an aging population the demand for holiday homes will taper over time so what its age was saying we reach the other side it will taper it all right thank you for then yes are we are we are we talking about the development contribution charges that loans were not we went through the workshop couple weeks cover the charges can I just ask a question talking and the charges that we had given here what are what are they relate to is it per application like this I 'm just not clear yes that 's based on a house or equivalent unit so it 's based on your standard residential development from a commercial perspective that goes through is to two methods we use either the household equivalent units and it goes through a conversion factor to work at a square meterage basis of demand or we can actually use specific demand figures so how much water how much waste what are they going to use so as figures there who single household presidential you know i miss the workshop so pardon me sorry so the francis have gone from 463 the water for instance to three and a half thousand approximately yes so to give you an application of unpack from a residential perspective which tackle was very very small historically we 've obviously built a pretty major SEO down the front near which has driven the increase charge therefore water as part of that we were we were very aware of what the total cost would be to developers for example and how that would impact on developing the dam and so the overall cost to say greenfield developments as actually come down slightly from what it was because the reserves judges and fit and feel so our m.phil developments gone up slightly just because their water charge we 're looking at about a live and a half thousand dollars for a little subdivision so this is pierre application lawful new dwelling 10 lakhs doubled again come up the charge has gone up slightly over but you 've gotta look at the full package not just individual costs and because we 're here then she bought the reserve lee in charge down significantly that 's actually had minimal impact on kanakam we can definitely send you a copy of the presentation I think it 's believed canceling our we obviously each other business would paper was it 's basically tracking download and some Kenya in some cases it 's gone down and most guys subscribe slide because they would a judge yeah what 's driven up right roger has commented i present behalf of consultation yet this process which is yet was open for you to reconsider this person right there are any okay all right okay I think we 've covered that one before they suggested recommended resolution there I could have a Boomer for that reservation please thanks can for a pack signaled by Councillor jolons for the adoption of the contributions and bloke model all those in favor say aye is against Kerry _"

Chairman asked for an itinerary you mentioned at the time that you with the north of April email to us that you may have explained for 4,000 or 5,000 dollars to be internal to going to another sister city which you sir would come from mural fund I be responded to you to ask me what does the mirror fun cover you then came back and said no will come from the sister city fund now we 've got to the date today announcement no nothing and a report quite frankly the tools as nothing right or we can do up have a report if you want of what we actually did on those days and what we talked about we certainly got that I 've got the nights of those of people with cancers one that I think we fear the report that she does cover what we did because if you go Tigers foot in about 3 14 x 14 bar for all of these things in a lock and list of the bullet points you can count them and that 's what we discussed you want more detail on those know what I 'm saying is the only when you go away on a trip like that you come back with an itemized report based on what you did we we did it a note stays here some of the people that you have met but what were the outcomes I can read as has just been stated that whole list that goes for a couple of pages it doesn 't actually give me any real information so none of 't give you any information so effectively if we look down on page 14 bar for you have it acquit ensure that the members and staff a trained in resources appropriate example Chinese business card to June would you discuss that with while you and China through the churro answer that one and became pretty apparent and we had this without tryna training part to departure that come with a vessel and our delegations as well it 's really important here torian 's business cards and actually a lot of Chinese people that we meet with commented on how professional awards obviously not that common for other people to do so so that 's simply a listen fundo other struck that in future and the hosting and boundary and the legations it 's one of those simple things that we can do but a peaceful food in my previous statements Oh any other questions or cancer cousins for the chair just a couple of things it was at night what what is there what are their key investment drives what they keen to do business business point of view you I 'm so couple of things so I 'm obviously with which to a song it 's really anchored around the investment that I 've got here so that 's a four and a half long dollar block of land above water lots o from the discussion of behavior with both municipal government and the shuffling association was around that and that 's really good to have actually a project and the district with chicken Inca I 'm what a general discussion as you see on both 13 bathroom fitting bath wall around things like tourism so if it was like digital screens they talked about putting together tourism packages educational exchanges it 's rehearing to avatar was it was a huge help so we 've got and so Joe actually coming out and sub 10 by bringing a cultural delegation to our Museum so I 'm y 'all_._317.95 so put it into those surface six categories around diplomatic economic cultural education and broke me into on social but as you can see a lot of it is more economic you have much to do with the as it 's about that at all or prevented a yes you Joe and he can on the other side well what a key industry that I train out of there my mom I 've gotten inside which is so Joe industrial park because I 've got a joint nas 's a 20 years old now 25 i think the singapore that 's probably high cheek watching industry so obviously Singapore 's the size of Lake total that are emulating and you then go up to assuage a new town which used to be farmland or existed it was actually on and business land as well and they 've done a huge cleanup project so they really try to balance how they move toward muldraugh high-tech economy on the flip side how do you deal with environmental environmental challenges so some of the discussions are here for them would around things like and the lake double protection trust so you and you just gotta see there the color with a water ways to know why they 'll be interested in it and feel ocular late through here what darling today speak um it the shell sing and switch it was slightly different yeah didn 't need ask the Christian generally will take retract some of my earlier statements from what I 've just heard it 's a pity that that wasn 't included in this report which would it give me a better understanding of what you actually we saw and talked about the resolutions not long enough so there will be a press release understand the pointing out the fact that you went on this trip this is what you achieved and this is the hopeful outcome let me quit rather than the resolution sees just received a report I 'll repeat it before 30 pages of stuff downloadable them fed I 'm not too sure really you could just have a link and save yourself a couple trees forest managers would have to trim for us yeah I guess that the point of the discussion is if we 're going to continue to support this relationship we just need round the table to understand what the priorities are and what the challenges are and to be honest I don 't get the points but there 's no timings or no key focuses or key learnings and often it 's that you know that personal report that gets written on how you experience doesn 't like I 've just learnt more now listening to you speak then I did reading this entire report so just if you can find a way to wrap that up so as we move forward with this relationship we understand collectively what it is we need to do yep certainly and so from my perspective to just ask if you 've got questions you 've got my number and secondly these things that I wouldn 't put in this report that I and you know because we 've gone in and and you know going offshore around some of our chances that China props i just don 't think somebody think it 's appropriate to have it you know in a public report basically i guess is chaos to em we need to be aware that we 've got real investment happening in China Shanghai pentwyn you know that procured property albeit and one still subject to from New Zealand or product of New Zealand they 're going to be right here on our doorstep so we need to understand them and know their customs you 've got rainbow holdings who purchased geothermal land you got the old J group of puts purchase the large property at can lock they 've actually made physical investments and it 's happening that 's actually happening so it 's not like a lot of our sister city arrangement or might do or might this and that might happen and daddy data this is actually happening so we need to get ourselves up to speed with what 's happening over there whatever your political views are ya they are your views saw the rate of investment by China into New Zealand that 's going to be something 's going to happen shortly national liver but yeah these guys are operating and we 're getting calls every day cruise every day about the Chinese investment whether it be the crater farms Lochinvar station or whatever I say you know it 's a huge it is a big deal so so we need to why this invitation was received and March yet we weren 't told about it to the night of 9th of April because there isn 't there a clause in the Standing Orders in regards of action is taken without the sanction of council I 'm not too sure the first date we couldn 't attend because we had LTP is that right clothes so they rescheduled the date the original invitation I think it was the 20th was the request for the great you more Celine celebration unfortunate because of LTP discussions we couldn 't see in a delegation at that stage and so it was basically we went to and fro with the front of his office with I 'm sheltering to look at Teatro dates from there which was when we came to the date that we did as you can see it 's a very short time frame in terms of the turnaround this is very common when we 're dealing with China that we get requests for something to happen and within the and it happens when we have delegations come down here as well 've got here is the 28th the VAP rule correct ok so the original invitation came in and march and the invitation that i saw on the information I received after the month of April talked about that 4,000 year celebration of the guy that developed up whatever okay so the point I 'm making even if that taking that into account and remember that the delegation was away during our last council meeting wise counselors were we not informed prior to the night of April he was the first invitations and you see where we can make it or they change quickly we were not asked what we thought now for instance the more fun it transpires about information on here that it was only three thousand dollars for accommodation visas gifts etc so does that mean we 're two thousand dollars under because originally announced we got as counsel said it would be for the visit to the second sister city while in china but my main concerns are as a council we weren 't it was important we could have called an extraordinary meeting for an hour my boner contention why weren 't we told and why wasn 't it made public so I 'm not when I 'm looking to see I 'm not looking at you necessary I 'm happy to answer in terms of a memo that was sent through to David and Rob in terms of the the groups and see if i do not know off the top of my head what date that 's done apologies but Rob you might want to before would ever do not entirely sure what we just responded when we got the the invite and a 3k 45 you know people delegation I think was very very good value for money buried unwind most of these trips you got to pay for you you know you gotta pay for st. Ann can I just add the two credit are representations were outstanding and I think Bernhard will you pick me up on this they were just that was absolutely a masterstroke having those two people for two feet are really gave it some some grunt as well as well specifics of the dates and the times found out sorry but but the original date wasn 't we could not attend say they came back with a navigate mr. Phil into the diary now if the earth Sunday night and Friday night so effectively when you first got that invitation data around the 20th or 21st of March was it changed after that yeah it will change that okay but you had that invitation Lynn but we didn 't hear about to the night forgive me i 'm actually going to go things would change we weren 't advised as counsel because we sit down at that stage and i 'm getting you missing my point mr. chairman if it came in and march why were we told in april with you eat even in june from so that wouldn 't matter we we told ya i I can 't answer we did the time we have the timing is as we as things we 're particularly confirmed through the chief I just don 't understand the summers prescription around the whole point of thing there 's no opportunity over China economic benefits it was the time discussed in the town council training given us a time frame you get what Khloe 's saying about historically what does happen with his arrangements sure to go some flexibility they can 't when it come to these sort of arrangements with you know fraternity look at developing the local economy you can 't sit on their hands and wait you have another meeting disgusted learn a thing thank you for the report okay okay thank you mmm you ever so inquiries like as I suggested resolution the earth at the important and and please if anyone 's got any more questions or anything like that all available as he said and also Bernhard like to thank the another self bubbly for your support and could I have a move for the resolution things Thank You counsel imps and seconded by Councillor Stewart all those in favor please say aye aye inst area ok item number 15 Tina don 't have _"

    "text": "afternoon John good afternoon counselors yeah I 'm sure you 've all read the agenda item and basically with museum forest managers have been our forestry management company since December 2004 and they did a good job for the first five years and were reappointed in 2005 for another five-year extension which ran from one july two thousand and five through to 33rd jun 2015 say 2010 normally we would go out to tender and look for basically put the contract at patina and they would reboot in order to reapply to win the tender and that we go through abnormal for procurement process but as noted in the item we 're currently in the middle of three quite significant projects within our forestry investment and as you would have seen what one isn 't the young pinus radiata crop added rangatahi which was planted in 2005 currently in the middle of a pruning regime and for the next two years there 's a second waste then work which needs to go on which is part of normal maintenance secondly the Ranga taki douglasville which was harvested in 2013 we of our of the first release editing atoki so that works set to commence very soon in last but not least is the to honor forest block up in the tire on the first instant forest rangers have put in a significant time over the last two years sort of scoping out the whole forest block is spoken under for quite difficult quite challenging separate blocks that are different age and different maturities and excesses proven quite challenging and so there 's been quite a lot a negotiation with the local landowners and adjacent farmers and that kind of thing too sort of obtained access across their lending and cover that the best possible harvesting plan which is still ongoing so yeah I do behind the item is that for me to go out for tinder and we were to appoint another forest ninja all that work would sort of come to a bit of a halt in to be potentially some significant disruption to those projects so yeah so that basically what we looked at was the idea that we could look at extending the existing contract for further which is the premium and the real planting ends and hopefully also will be lot further down the track in terms of knowing where we are and with the Torah harvest say thank strike right so any Christians are welcome any questions of John 's very quickly John is some the two years enough to fulfill the contract well if it 's not this will revealed at that point and if a further total extinction is appropriate at that time that would be lovely the resolution here mr. Chipper Jones thank you um you wish it 's just a quick question for me in terms of our procurement policy this extinction is not as per our usual practice raising a legal issues I 'm through each year no and we 've been very conservative on this if you look at page 12 bar too you 'll see the management and maintenance fees any total 122,000 over the two years which actually suits with an CEOs delegated authority what we do in practice is that forest managers arranged with the subcontractors for the pruning and replanting etc so we actually pay so to be open and transparent we 've brought this to council because a total cost and theory being paid to forest managers of sin hundred or thousand over the two years so use of fits within our procurement policy but we 've actually taken it extra considered a step to make sure they come through counsel to be seen to be kosher even though the contract with first managers as only four hundred twenty two thousand for the management and maintenance you cancel kruszewski thank you for clarity then the recommended resolution should be for what amount 702 or some more than 7,000 as the amount of the two years Alan say you see because you 're saying that the contract for the management is for early 100 in using horsemanship contractor subcontractor surgeon a lot of the work and so they will invoice us for 770,000 but they will be on charging the work than were subcontractors so so yes really cheers so what we 're doing is being very careful make sure to our backs are covered and should you like a figure of sin hundred seven so okay okay any other questions of John suggested resolution Aaliyah sends the contract that calzone for expenditures just in contract by 32 years favor for similar incident as nurses as an additional cost am here civilization yep John sorry Roy opzioni are you we should amazing oh you know that yeah it 's no second thank you very much madam time you can see you wish but don 't worry been very back and somebody seconded by Councillor thank you so I is against Gary what here we go Hey stand aside sorry yeah nothing sorry to spoil you and regards to the antidote virus once it 's cleared will it be replanted yes at this stage we are still working on the axis if we also when we get the access issue resolved we will then decide what is the best future direction and it might be that it 's more beneficial to us to still the whole forest land and trees but their implications under the day emissions trading scheme before we will not to replant the item number 13 thanks John thank you very much good deeds to and agreements to comply the Financial Mail its conduct fund out the actor 2013 an interest of time I won 't go through this page by page especially what this put a link in there no no you mean actually have them more please so that you got this sign you got this you got the zipper so our table is ready it 's really a process because we are the greater amendments or we don 't if we don 't agree then we can 't use the local government funding agency there 's a vending machine for council okay thanks alan kelso krasovsky and i just ask a couple questions for clarification please on page two of the actual document fourth the last paragraph under us under Section 13 when I talk about going up from 500,000 to 750 salaries but yet in practice it 's up to a million dollars I don 't quite understand the rationale behind it if in practice their loans are a million dollars while would you only bring it up to 750 pound sorry I can 't answer that one and down to you previously his wife 's to us we know what it round bounty has has been well this is a guarantee by each of the shareholders shelves you okay and just lastly on page 73 you 've got Bank New Zealand limited and then bank of new zealand I preserve a mistake or I don 't_''_568.329 these two separate banks that are not aware and the reference bangs reference plane Scott ANZ Bank New Zealand limited so there is the ANC bank yeah because he used to be a zit national and they rebranded it the end ANZ Bank New Zealand asset and then there 's a bank New Zealand super thing must present a novel to read any spelling mistakes I 'm going to cheer him a couple of questions thank you for mr. mean he know I 'm on the front kind of the item had mentioned that there are several change has been made to deeds and agreements to reflect what 's happening in current practice what activities or current practices that we got that are out of line at the moment that we need the facility that that one of those is the actual operation of the LG fa had to be refined and that is so it meets the security act requirement there 's a wholesale Linda so any procedural changes actually will within the LG FA I think there was some reference to that on here yeah just just one other question in Thank You Eleanor who drafted these resolutions because it very specifically linked back so elected officials knowingly understanding what it is what they 're doing basically and have the ant interests of the community who drafted these resolutions they 're quite detailed Simpson Grierson and that 's why we have included in these attachments comments from simpson Grierson and they in conjunction with the LG fa came up with the amendments and that 's table display so standard for every shareholder council so we 're all passing exactly the same resolutions um yeah because I guess the question is when you 're dealing in the wholesale market your our actually classified or as a knowledgeable buyer which means that there are this disclosures needed to be made so is officials do not to be those knowledgeable buyers I 'm just seeking know our mission the OGF a in conjunction with the management office of central government go to the wholesale market worldwide and raise the funds we then get offered if we request a particular Dalai lion a right which is so many basis points above the cash rate or so the young the bond rate so we 're not involved in the actual funding of the OT fa and so as the council do we deal in the wholesale market or the retail market um we do in the site from this okay window up and raise our own debentures in the new zealand marketplace which is wholesale we don 't go offshore we only stay with the new zealand so yes we are dealing in the wholesale market we 're not dealing in the retail market and I guess we would temper that without our provisions and our P&L risk correct and we normally use a bank or something of this nature as our intermediary thank you guess I 'll just fell on from councillor cousins are section 78 of local government act actually see is I can quote that before you throw the chair if you like I have an Iranian I rented it out said I had to read it there is no razor term mr. chairman is if we look at the resolution part for its takes two tuners that includes with its discretion under section 79 to the LGA the council will not undertake specific consultation or other engagement on this matter but this then concerns me but will rely on elected members general knowledge and understanding of the community 's views and preferences to satisfy the seed section 78 so I want to move an amendment that in Section 4 from the word but so it reads other engagement on this matter from the word but to the end of LGA Oh to be removed so that section will read determines in accordance with its directions under section 79 blah blah will not undertake specific consultation or engagement on this matter and that this is consistent with the council significant and engagement policy I 'm not prepared to risk myself and my to rely on elgin or knowledge on this matter so I 'd for me move that amendment Thank You counsel body and any commentary on there is ever I don 't have an issue of that myself but she will choice it was the other councillors Casa Cristo scheme for clarification counselor body the way I interpret that is that that we expected to know what the community 's views and preferences are not necessarily that we understand the knowledge and understanding of the we 're supposed to understand the knowledge for read it again knowledge and understanding of the community 's views and preference that 's the wording that worries me because I sometimes struggle with 78 read 79 as well and it will also go to up to 14 so I 'd rather that was the out of that resolution and then where 'd some later stage would not be liable if we have we 've just gone through this morning with that drama over what we can say and I 'm billion if I 'm going to get in trouble on this one guess I think your are we getting up mean they are our consultants on legal issues well through the sheriff if if we make resolutions country to some somewhere some recommendations that I always get very nervous so my thoughts on that is that you have the ability to pass one of the resolutions in wish but we may end up having to bring an item back to you at the future meeting to real clarify why some serious and have recommended the word murdering the way they have but that 's the risk you run is that you may have to redo an item or read about this item down the track but I certainly am good mad Sophie now I could get my goals were to provide advice but I think it 's probably Farland oh yeah you 're up to come and think on the fly like that as well when you worship that section 78 c is the local authority is not required by the six line to undertake any consultation process or procedure and yet it saying that the means general knowledge of and I find that rather I Simpson grierson or someone else that doesn 't matter well you wish it doesn 't matter to me because it looks as though you no I 've got to sign the supreme on and I want to make sure whatever i 'm going to sign is correct and i would prefer to text sense in Greece bresson 's recommendation and councillor bodies thank you for the vote of confidence I 'm not knocking I 'm not mocking Simpson grace and what I 'm saying is don 't sing bass and words allowing me by the printer now asking that amendment yes I guess you applied almond think the role here if you can understand the resolution that 's line if you find it confusing you should ask us some more advice of Americans review what 's the implications are packing this one at the moment it needs to be signed up for the first of June okay all right um so what did one of the counselors feel they should go to the Susan Forester possibly also just yeah the person who asked the regulation love to have a look meeting will take some deliberation turnover in you able to fear that item number 13 I know final visit to fairs _"

reason why we 're discussing it now another six months ago we made that period of time to go through the tendering process so we chose the other course I just wanted to clarify yeah yeah you have sir john 's you 've got different got your speaker he said oh yeah okay yeah that 's good okay think he casts Oh peg leg yes thank you your worship I 'm done is what was it expected that like this contract would almost double its its estimate yes yeah so it 's been allocated in the in the perfect elements within the budget set up email account it yes okay thank you thank you okay it 's been moved by Councillor body of a second to please think he canceled back suggested resolution there we 'll recommended resolution all those in favor please say aye mine was against it Gary thank you item number five pullip erode seeking your worship this is a proposal to reduce the speed on prepaid from valet key drive for about 800 metres from 100k down to 80 k the key stakeholders the police NZTA automobile association in generally the residents of rule and agreement with that ATK speeds I by the reduction of the speed is likely to be a reduction and a number of pressures and also the severity of crucial if you anybody study need technical questions then I 'll hand over to clear your answer text us many Christians are clear general I I support it on the reason on one of the pages here I think it 's five by ten there 's an incidents that nearly help you guys to work we 're traveling from the West on paper road we now don 't turn down wat and Elaine we go and turn into a case of a road because it 's safer it surprised me how fast they take that corner so I 'm fully supportive if you have a Christmas was just a question of clear the team injury accident or an hour we on the corner of the intersection will bei up the 800 meters and there 's a diagram on page spot pages of our seven and it 's basically their whole section between where Tammy lane ends okay so Sexton successor and its really that 's really where that pressures are actually occurring what we end up okay where they swing onto we yeah basically I can 't cancel open so Dennis if we approve this resolution when when are you able to actually action this week I 'm just concerned it says to be in corporate incorporated into the speed limit by law review so can you feel the signs up before you do the review or we would implement it straight away remember it would be corporated until review body review the medicos next year so if somebody is picked up to speed in at a PK and it 's not in our bylaws is a problem or no under the current bar law and council came by the solution have changed the speed and so that that 's how that would occur and then once they won once prevent it and that it would become legal okay thank you so it comes because it will pass us today becomes legal from today yeah you 've got the media to go no dia it 's pretty important kelsa kruszewski is i whole heartily endorsed this in as a part-time cyclist I think it 's just another way of showing that they the district every year looking after our cyclist as well and go for that yeah and especially for the residents to have those that boundary on to that particular Road of those 800 meters a secret result mr. mean Hemant through the chair it 's what the speed limit shows on the sign that counts it was an article in the paper this morning which showed in one year that their change the speed limit from 7260 but anyone selling it being changed so it was 60 going at one direction 70 going in the other and legally that 's how it stood right okay thank you know just let some cousins so you kind of here I 'm surprised we 've got to item 5 for anyone he 's wearing today we good we did of your absence this morning oh really um I 'm two frames of mind about this one I have to say I read the report about the number of crashes and it 's only been a couple there there are they parts of the district which aren 't covered by ATK 's with his built-up zones I here counselor customs fees comments on cyclists as much as I respect cyclist don 't pay road text be on the road anyway so when they do maybe we can more accommodating but I 'm really concerned that always seem to do a slow traffic down around the region and you I understand it is always going to be drivers which cause grief but I notice here the average speed is 91 point of crashing 91 kilometers so gonna slow down by 11 k 's is that going to make a difference and so we 're all driving bamboo bikes like to give a cow manure run on how to know pinecone oil cars going to be running around the district here this speed so us the US and answer the question will it and make a difference use that is likely to reduce the number of crashes and also reduce the severity of questions the faster you go when you stop the severity increases the faster you wait but 10 we had 10 crashes and five years I may have messed up it was here other stats in here though wow this location is quite yes a team crashes not 20 teen teen yeah yes just a couple ideas I 'm just saying is it I couldn 't see any other computer other areas through it sorry trilogy yes i said i agree with a proposal of of that road runs we normally use Disqus she got caught of a candle and when i won the residence ground Spence saying we went through a fence okay one day just better to remove it from the intersection so I 'm fully supportive Lee proposal okay cancer children um I Drive right quite regularly and whenever I come here it 's kind of a natural place to slow down anyway you 're coming into town it that part well that 's how I do so I don 't think it 's going to be too much of a problem for motorists to be slightly are dating I 'm good through the cheer thank you just a question for mr. Lewis and the NZTA to not see the need for us to extend that ATK for 800 meters but we 're recommending that we do what was our rationale for their place under look through the cheer that the NCT I guidelines i was actually 800 meters for an 80 k zone so they actually didn 't know their own rules oh really how I think T yeah I get to be a better than the report okay thank you very much selling coke on me and talked about it enough then this via Tino is important do I have a move the late resolution make you can circus toski singing the boy counselor Eggman thank you whereas in final PSR night against would you like the recorded can certainly think what 's riccardi drug what 's the registration did have method ax item number six draft rénovée report to the debt the draft asset management planes there 's a executive summary form each of the asset management planes that is on a graph film and I should point out of establish that the financial growth that 's in there is the furniture represents the financial information post any decisions that were made through the groups of activities workshops that information has currently been put together by the finance team and those grace will be updated every today or tomorrow to represent of the final draft numbers makes slow sin equations of a sluice cancers Cristo ski run thank you for this very comprehensive report and we 've also received this report here I 'm not sure whether you had received it yes I just want to make sure that and the comments that were made by the order the general more or less addressed in in what we have here I think I mentioned that the workshop on tuesday of last week that will perish produce last week and the asset management plans were were finalized about a month ago so she 'll answer was probably long document so we 're reviewing the two but at the moment possibly not open it there 's probably giving them correct message I would like to think that any of those things are incorporated man we just haven 't had time yet to look at the two documents and compare cancer Truman and justice couple of those they say 65 yeah I don 't hum that and it c their energy carrier it 's no longer cool to need to go get changed and it 's why how many fans now it also i just had a christian and say what do today campground so the number of rateable properties is 200 the question I had was how come it 's 300 there but then when you go to the waste water schemes at Scott that 's just one rateable property so how is it 200 a little deeper water supply schemes in only one red and puffy nice life sorry counselor I don 't have a media dance for they probably should only be one because it 's the military in brown by itself will only supplier river a reflection of the number of users of peak rather than companies but it should be property there would have been out so if there be no more members in the less water is going but there 's only one another question I had so it is probably similar thing at emu DC is it 's got 75 for district water supply schemes and then and the wastewater let 's go 181 rate of all properties so again number rail these things I would need to get back to you on that okay so you were just these come here just the easel but if there 's any inconsistency on here that will be adjusted better feels a reasonable explanation for those differences then I will I will sing that out okay thank you all right any other questions I just thought it would just have a Korean it just just to do with the figures on six bar seven when we talk about demand forecast and it goes through all the activities the growth is predicted at 788 i would suggest lots that correct good we 're going to of this in a previous question for november comments made in me and regards of secretly the tapper district currently it 's the supplier vacant residential lots over time these will be developing new drilling well you know this will suppress the lead for the creation of new lots we live in to a contradiction here one stage was sound we 're going to need X and then yellow and were saying that a man might not be so great in dreams this is a prediction of what 's likely to be created over the next ten years where 's the strategy is more talking about what 's currently available I think one of the answers is there once you create a lot obviously you need service up so there 's a bit of a plane there to provide for that the information that you really others that we do have a large number of serviced developed but um but mocks they don 't have houses on here okay any other questions of us for us in the case i 'm going to suggested resolution their draft as asset management a result of the ltp process could i ever move a place thank you cancel williamson seconded by Councillor stewart who is in favor please say aye I knives against arid _"

    "text": "Baker Street and eliz here and just acknowledge so mr. Vaughn in in the back deck where the afternoon boom must see it better job I know Sheree and if you have any questions be there at seven come up one of your life you want to come up with something Stella I 'll take the report as being read and just kind of summary comment on it that it 's really an opportunity to try some vibrancy two-bit town center space and for the loss of truth carfax the earth and you were saying it forms consult above the surrounding businesses and their two signed off the air program of the proposal in counseling to toefl also supportive of the proposal which is at zero cost to counsel the only thing that I had to add as if an capsule would furthermore temporary solution we do head platforms and tubs down at the Riverside market which owned by council Inge and we could work with fine on utilizing those so I have some pictures of those here and the only downside to their alternative options that there 'd be shape to fit into parallel on a parallel bit sideways packs so the preferred option LOL is the as the agenda item yep yes Eric Lee so um are you proposing to use the same color papers and to extend down to those two cohorts it 's the sidewalk the same as at the moment okay our landscape architect that would be the one that would yep sort that out okay thank you goes to kill somebody Thank You elephant for the presentation then I had a comment here was the garden got to be moved to the top side or stay and you 've got this business about the tubs it was their only ready for scrap metal probably do a little bit better but if they guard if the garden is not moved do we lose another car park was it just solely on it to area are you talking about if we use the platform and sweet cream what i was looking at without the garden here as it is now so is the garden going to go there or you going to take that out and is going to be extended apartments going to mixed in it so what I 'm getting out that garden stays or we put tubs in my garden the zoo the garden the garden state sorry yes the gardens gonna stay exactly where this is purely for the use of those two car packs that are highlighted in that photo thank you so if you reach in the steel tabs were they going to gay so do so the steel tabs is under the whole community of tier pre-measure and they would go with a net red area as well you 'll see on that handout I 've given you and there 's a plan that shows the dimensions of the temporary platforms and how there 's some funny awkward triangle areas left over yeah that could be weird tried there before in the past elsewhere Emily will put the those product I 've got a photo here yeah and it sort of doesn 't sort of still looks like a car pack but you can 't get him because of the edge we did reason why my question the second was the slope of the curb area be three to four percent have you talked to X is taboo about that I talked to her success tap ok so the question would be would you be able to easily wheel a wheel chair on there because the same level well I don 't think I think you will never talk cuz we 're now getting quite stroppy on that that we do have access for people that do need access because one day I might want to go there and not um it 's looking like I feel sure you 've pulled the favors yeah look at the level of the curve not for the curb whatever you don 't it 's all at the same level is the footpath yeah there might be so the one beside and just to explain the students we 're used to protect darkness from traffic that 's the purpose of the students although you know they we try to sort of have treason to make them look nice if we extend the power of his art into those car parks it will be to protect the darkness and so that 's that 's the difference between the two suggestions any other questions are mysterious in terms of that the slope of that paved area that 's largely determined by the the lever left the footpath we haven 't carrot cubas and we the kid would BFF was extended out and that 's typically about battery to four percent we haven 't done any specific design you but that would be reached through at that time so effectively it 's going to be three or four percent or it 's going to be float which is going to be 65 as I see if we need to do a specific design their various a grade on it at the moment based purely on so prisoned it would be in the order of 3 4 3 2 for pc but we 'll be trying to minimize that as much as possible well any mr. chairman if it doesn 't see excess Taupo then I think you really need to reconsider what you 're doing we would be taking what to access to our world at get Nicky cancer Jones worship just a question with it any nearby businesses that objected we 're done okay thank you cancer treatment yes it 's similar to those lines and when we were talking about the sale of the two-footed tour car park we had a lot of the public who upset at losing spaces Catholics Isis so does counsel in Virginny the public desert I had before it is it 's positive but um have we got any precedent of what 's happening in other places end any public thank you sir you mentioned the report that you could replace a couple of taxi things or was it over there run at the moment their carpets taxi stands but they 're not being used sufficiently for Texas teams so stuff if I could just be changed to normal carfax and the indication we 've get got from the feedback we 've received is that the public would be supportive of this but then again that 's only the feedback from the straight in from town seem to topple there could be other businesses and the wider just straight sananda sure hear him figure out an oaken sure that 's the pack did you know I was just going to say that and with the teeth pre I do not support that concept of all with a last council meeting wheel and will degree agree to open up corners of streets and maybe use a bit of a tanned and make it more accessible for people and so yeah definitely don 't support that but I 'd like to actually move this resolution I really believe that in congratulate mr. noon I 'm wanting to add water and our eat streets as such m in also to add to the vibrancy and I 've personally spoken to a couple of the other businesses on the other side story all for this one hundred scene so I 'm very happy to meet it Josie don 't ok can some basoski thank you for that just a couple of question on a holistic basis what is the long-term plan of the road and they 're packing overall for the poor dead street I know that and the toefl town centre structure yes there is no specific plans for the street its function on the transport network is likely to remain as others which is like a combination of public space in transport so it 's not specifically transport little lousing what public space is available for the dining experience okay the reason why ask that you worship is that under the risks you quite rightly mention council may find it difficult to reason that another similar application should be declined now if you look ahead and there are two or three other potential similar places that could ask for something like that during the essence would change the the function of the road and also diminish the the car parking which we haven 't addressed as such on a long-term basis I 'm all for it in in principle but I just want to be sure my own mind that the long-term perspective having looked and looked at and investigated doesn 't get so heavy I 'm all for it too and I congratulate you I think it 's a great idea that is the narrower side of the street so that side and I think it 'll definitely add to the flavor so so for me Thank You councillor Hagen could just raise up in regards of cancer cut-offs keys comments there are other areas in town that we 've already approved one recently spiral road and Commander or Twitter pongo and the others so it 's already already happening in regards of that that plan that fellas just talked about that section on 10 for what those two provisions are so I 'm quite a bit was the deal cancer Williamson you saw thank you wish your eyes deuce you know support the proposals will and in terms of they picking up council tremors point about you know we are pre-empting may what may not have in the future with regarding the potential development it will definitely complement you know at the stage and also being on a sunny side the street obviously he proposed note what else you happen if you want and only yeah so they will all see it would be attractive before being on the sunny side of the street because I you stopper at if the others will probably in via Sylvia but it was so good for everybody so I support it when the wind is coming alright sounds pretty good and cancel has been suggested reservation near so we go to read yeah right so it 's this one and turn forget about the oil and it 's been moved by Councillor park scene 2 by cancer cousins all those in favor please say aye eyes against ok oh yeah ok ok thanks Bill well I think so thanks for see you and thank you Ella item number livin like kept our plane mr. Mickey just to let go good i 'm your man shipping counselors it 's a fairly short report which is unusual for me but it wasn 't a globular foot in it so I 'm quite happy to take it as read and answer any questions but it 's essentially a debate and a decision for you to make us a nicotine come so just just in the recommended resolution I 've just like it to verified that I was the ultimate member I money bev actually attended to all the meetings I wasn 't required but I just like that reflected in the resolution please cancer cousins yeah thank you Nick sorry get a short stay in the UM just a couple questions I had I suppose from her they could mean this point of view and it 's been saved politics around the world we get elected on our popularity not necessarily a skill set so i would like to ask and you pretend a lot of the meetings of counselor jolons and your is it three questions for you I don 't put you on a spot this county number as council Jones member of that committee no comment on that document in that because I 've received feedback the council Jones as one of the top performers of that standing committee as things currently stand the issue doesn 't revolve around the performance of our counselor at all in fact quite far from that the issue revolves around the fact that we have a normal form with the bunch of Mars that have decided that they need to show the leadership of mares to there were certain other representation people who represented other councils that just went of the caliber of our own counsel there so rather than debate who should or shouldn 't be there from the male form perspective they just called 40 miles to be around the table so that they could have the moral debate that doesn 't mean that at future meetings the alternate if you choose to go with cultural Jones is no label to go it 's purely a desire of the male form to have the mayor 's at the table to progress the debate I appreciate them Rob I do but I brings you back to what about what they want is of the mural forum is about worth this flat committee and if it has been counseled roland has added value how is she going to continue to add value to that role and a secondary position as an alternate absolutely you know I acknowledge can 't work cassady jonas is done as well and she 's all over this like a lizard drinkin is it worth him so which is great but i think she will probably do still most the river you don 't have if you still okay to do that will put a little mr. chairman not Jenny most is returning excuse me I 'm talking up to most of the week and and so I think what they 're wanting is as the me is to be the lead person and and alternate aim so you know on I 'm happy or whatever you guys decide but that said that 's the general flavor what 's coming out of the mural for such a little too much I guess rise to the point the exam of salary summary states that form was recently met it 'll recommends that means cheers original council should be the primary counsel can you give me as as a counselor and understanding that you will be able to attend one hundred percent of the meetings but i just said i can 't i work or not i 'll be able to go to somebody was our feet if effect that 's mean it or not effectively how how often do this is for a that the form is scheduled to meet on a monthly basis that meeting sheet or is actually been laid out for the remainder of the year i expect with the change of membership with a number of the council 's putting forward their mears as the primary representative that there may be some tinkling to that she jus but um there 's a sale all the members are very busy people so the decidual is laid out months in advance so 15 mr. chairman of that is the case you can write into your for diary that on the tenth of every month whenever the date happens to be that you will be able to attend if you have suddenly comes up in the Sierra that you as linear must attend you have a deputy could list very hickley they continue in your behalf and I take into account a living by one well it talks about the risks and I think it 's actually rather actually when you read what those risks car not going to go through them but I mentions the heavy workloads of years and we some other ears the district whose mere have those same workloads there won 't be out of a team so why are we considering changing the first delegate and the second delicate at this time opposing counsel jolons remains for the chair sorry remains in hip position is primary and the mayor does the ultimate I 'd second that you through the cheek not going like this night Nord respected cash holy competent we all know that Ray story we want the army as our leader and we 'll say we want our mere to show leadership and the V here is the number one citizen in the district so to the disparities suggested to talk about popularity and in common see I 've on every very very distasteful the actual under time they are fond it this one and under Tony that you know if I find it the contact through 11 years as in the district this the most is the most relevant most appropriate way of dealing with it will always be a regional most lenders I came through the chair that 's not being disrespectful we weaknesses as we all do we all have our strengths from what I can gather and the feedback from staff as well as our counselors that counselor Jones has performed her job admirably well and if it isn 't broken why are we trying to fix it oh this really isn 't seducing you quite the opposite you 're just missing the point of the other I point anyway so okay sorry it 's just reach it I just think it 's always as if we 're just getting probably a bit just based on the direction from the more firm as a particular path I think I mean it 's almost like you take the names over the resolution does it it 's that council replaces it yeah the mere replaces a capsular is the primary representative on the committee I don 't_''_1110.4 I rosie has been all over this and I know she 's put a lot of time a lot of work into it and I that 's fantastic but i think we 're probably losing sight of what the actual direction is from a male form thought that if you wanted to be on the committee then that 's your right yeah well yeah i 'm happy to be on it and the mural form has requested my participation so I the new form sir has suggested it it is recommending that hasn 't come back to the individual district with individual mirrors well as individual districts want okay and say is constantly um yeah I just look at this particular committee or working quality a little bit like the Waikato Red Road Transport Committee of the time on and just about all the same mess that are in this in this committee are only the Regional Transport community and it it does appear as I said when we first started to allocate certain responsibilities to councillors I did actually say that the mayor should represent this tapo District Council on the transport and I see this exactly the same no different so I think I think that 's something that the regional councils and these larger committees that 's how they function okay thanks guys I think any other hamidreza through the chair cuz obviously confidence from from the team and I have enjoyed working with mr. mr. Carroll I think the question is at the end of the day this council can do whatever it decides to do what this says is just a project champion it 's a person that I 'm at the end of the day this forum and the mayoral forum don 't have any particular I guess it 's our to your jurisdiction this is really just a communication job this person is I guess the project champion and I guess from my point of view the project champion is the person who is on the committee who attends the meetings not the old tuna there are some issues of the Waikato spatial plan and I don 't believe that we will ever address those issues that we just shuffle cheers around so that 's my view okay these cancer John 's alright is suggested resolution there and am so yep some turn ative yes and I 'm happy to move the resolution at viewer and suggest you as the alternate on the basis that I find the alternate I 'm not the primary point of contact otherwise I 'll stand down okay so you 're not happy to be the alternate okay is anyone else have you to be there alternate ending cancel pack all right I 'm so moved the resolution has been seconded by Councillor peugeot birthday felt has even got a single yet so i am thinking you can so happy and as counsel packers the alternative all those in favor please say aye oh in-hye as against no never recorded Jim so that 's the cousins and can somebody right thank you item number 12 John _"

    "text": "afternoon mr. Eddie smile smile at me please and not you 'll be like front reserve management plan okay so if you would call on in September as a council workshop on this item and the three main areas or two main areas that were raised was and vehicle access to the reserve that was generally but also raised in particular by nelly and john mackenzie and that was regarding the chain across a reserve and the effects of erosion and vehicle activity on that reserve damage both to the leg side and also on top of the reserve there is the protection of the 29 notable trees and you 'll note that i 've included an arborist report in the back of this this item and the third item was access to the informal boat ramp which is known as the Scotsman 's ramp and you 'll see two two or three items of communication to others two letters in there from to photo emeritus board and when from the marina company both requests in closure so I guess the point the instruction from that workshop was come back point is to determine appetite to consult the community as for their views so I try and answer any questions if I can 't Allison well questions or queries of mr. it just doesn 't search it Capleton go ahead knows we have discussion amongst counselors in regards of things one was I 'm still perplexed as to why this came to us as a workshop when this is clearly a 3-2 committee discussion that should have occurred sort of makes a bit of a not a mockery but his process and we sort of bypass that process and concentrate in school council and finance that I think it was there was a approach from the landowners the year and a concern and any requests at that stage was there will be considered by linear and counselors in terms of the subservient nature of your committees obviously council suits over the top of fridge at that time you had the option of saying actually I will refer the spectre Fred but you took the option that you would discuss it Annette and that council he sitting you did and now the loop Weaver you did by virtue of the fact that you had the discussion in the workshop it was a council workshop on the food on certain behavior so we should she be in it we didn 't want every wish we got the creek Committee you had a discussion at their time and you could have raised that issue if it hadn 't been of concern to you but as a council you discussed and made a number of comments in us for this item to then come to your counselor do not know we had a choice to say that you go away the the other issue of God is the because there 's a some effects on the reserve management plan Fred haven 't got that delegation so that 's why is coming through council go into the cheer of the free committee he said it has to come back to us anyway well the solutions if it goes out the submissions will be dealt with by French Oliver possibly there would be your decision ugly and so normally what would happen is for the management freed or it could be an ad hoc committee like what you did this morning for another policy GOP policy and it would be not to that committee in here and make recommendations back to Council but as John says the the governing body in terms of policy is council and then only council can make their policy decision we 're going to send it but we put Maggie and I and today we are always promoting the the community board as the correct avenue of process and up through and the big umbrella and this the way i see it has not gone through that right chang we sort of circumvented and we sort of open a can of we were so anyone can just a little bit of a grief come straight to counsel that 's just my view just a couple other things are noticing there was the report on the agenda item and says the protection of notable trees on the reserve regards to parking at notes that and the report it says about the roots of the trees having leo mt on 12-bar 3.2 it the roots of the trees and some areas are exposed to the constant vehicle use but the report that subscribe doesn 't mean that at all the only rosen it actually feeds to is the lake so i 'm surprised with it came from well that 's that 's my observation that 's not noted in sorry sorry John that 's my observation okay but he 's not notified why we got from Terrell not to do the report now I 'm saying that 's my observation so I mean it doesn 't take an arborist to see roots exposed on the ground in the faith of this in Judah cars and I guess that the policy response from that is that you council has seen fit to protect those trees and under the district plan you actually you are in breach of their district plan by allowing people to drive and park under those trees I know but I pray that it 's not in this report any we know is that but if a concern it 's a now reporters officers to you which is on so as are experts in this field and we are providing you Arab expert opinion I understand that but and the photographs that you 've supplied I don 't_''_328.07 this students that photographs of the report until we 're out of it where are we here religion photographs okay where it is yeah I know I just positive agree with both pass here I understood that the outcome of that workshop was there was one particular query was water with a workshop was from a couple those residents the air the what 's-her-name so John and John and Natalie Mackenzie you know Tony races with the traffic or traveling along the air was the issue of the barrier right outside their place yeah said so that 's the one issue I didn 't feel that traffic traffic movements were in a show at all so as far as that 's concerned bits on the soup for you for the always in that as an issue in terms of not traffic moving per se because that 's father is a management plan but the damage to the notable trees in the boat and which obviously these symmetries here that we need to do something about so I suppose the chairman of the Fred committee year what his suggestion would be going forward I believe a lot of us had never done site visit as well have you seen the barriers up halfway there of their BM you 've seen the chain so you know the chain that they 're talking about it goes across halfway yeah just ask a question your worship what was the reason to engage in outside arborist when we employ office we 've got two obvious on the on the council and there was two issues really around the fact that were notable trees we wanted some independence to be seen to be independent on that advice so guests fundamentally that was it I just felt we needed some independence we 're losing it with a regulatory authority as well so the council we 're protecting the trees we can inform you what to do with those trees that would be a conflict of interest for the officers involved sorry dispirited it can I asked why we use consultants is a recognized consultant to go to their on my I 'm not aware of any consultants in taupe others number of arborist but none that do consultancy work I could be created another and how much did it cost he would have been about fifteen hundred dollars 1500 up and just particularly i 'm 12 and 11 and 12 x 12 and one pleasure from toprol nearly 80 20 20 years just open about 13 months old in the letter from to philly tub Molly trust borders from way in the last rhenium dead views from either of those organizations changed no where are they we had a meeting early this year with the CEO of two photo mode chess board on a number of issues and this is one that came up so no they haven 't changed and the reason I included those was really just to contextualize the issue so I 'm just presenting you with with some views there I guess great thank you if you just like that a lot from what counselor cousin saying I think we 're certain whether we gave a probably be wrong on this last month we got onto the issue of some concessions on the lakefront and I think the last three committee we approve 32 mile Bay kayaking etc where is the difference I mean this is the second time that this is heaven if we have a free committee or we dice and I think there needs to be sorted out now because that 's the reason we have the free committee so again I would say that this item is around around up is the resolution size of proposed change to policy which the food committee don 't have delegation for hints at sitting in front of you free do have delegation for granting of license where it 's in accordance with a minister current management plan or policy this is a challenge and that 's the still see at a dish that you will see from time to time items for things like concessions come on to the council agenda that haven 't been to freed and that 's purely due to a matter of timing there 's a time pressure then they could the last meeting you remember the refreshment that we spoke refreshment kiosk proposals that we spoke about earlier in the minutes yeah and sorry is not a full member of the Fred committee I would also like the opportunity to ever say on some of these things so come back if it was afraid thing that comes back here anyway has been to full council free don 't make the decision this is to counsel in Frieda we 're include quite separate hats and we have to under the legislation and under the delegation that the minister has provided one as an operation center via an operational hurt I 'm not explaining this very well in Ellison is the expert in one 's of policy hetzer ones sitting there we are in the head of the minister as the delegator and ones as the council recommending to the minister so two quite distinctly different heads until relatively recently we couldn 't do the stuff that we asked council to do we had to take that to the minister for approval so for the change to a management plan the government doing so made it very clear that councils would have to have the separation so it can be can be confusing but officers are doing the best to put the right things at the right time yeah I don 't think there 's any doubt in this room that we wanted to protect those trees there and kind of proud of Kendall but is there is another option discussed in the paper which is optional so which was closer reserved for most of the year and open it I could see some benefits and there in terms of because it will be traffic issues and kind of just want entries lot of people to be used around the table there was a viable option so I think officers know my views on this yet so the intent is to us the intentions item is where when I was appetite to ask the community some of those questions so it could be that support to the community this is not about you make a decision today this is about going out and asking the community absolute Gary in the room just could just lead off here I 'm absolutely element that remains open to the public for hexes ease of access what you 're doing and affected closing off traffic and you 're in effect creating a private reserve for those lakefront homes and I 'm totally against adherents from this it 's only 62 the year I was born the wider community you 'll get an uproar because there 's a very particularly popular part and people like to just travel down there quietly go along there and just have a swim have to work or whatever so I 'm certainly adamant that I 'm against the traffic absolute total closure The Scotsman ramp I believe we have reached a good decision with the marina company now that they will discount their boat launching fees quite considerably after two young people with smaller vessels and yeah meet the marker there 's a word we 're so I 'm quite comfortable with that phasing phasing out or certainly just really their own to just do any size so tightest jumping achievement and just really conscious that their counselors expressing their opinions should you choose to go in a consultation you wouldn 't want to be seen that your pre determining anything and so I think if you look at recommended resolution one which talks about supporting and principal the closure obviously you can talk about that because you can decide whether or not to to support an the closure or not yeah yeah my issue is going through each one media likely to I 'll finish it up the am so i go around the room i suppose as to whether you support that part 1 of the resolution so i guess if i came maybe maybe an easy way of doing it might be saying do you support going and asking the community their preference because the status quo which is not to go out of the community would be to leave the status quo as it currently stands if and so if that 's not an option in the nuts about going out to the community idea seen us about what options do you put to the community she 's an option for pattern yeah so give just your have a different different opinion on kefir versus the and the look boat launching ramp so is there any way to to separate them because I think they 're quite two separate issues myself and they would be separated in terms of the process and you would have people be able to submit on one both or neither yeah when either or both I guess again what you need to do i think is to decide do you want to go out and consult and if you do on what options so you want to consult on the boat launching read so if you want to consult on should we close the divide launching ramp or not then that something you can consult on i 'd say you probably don 't need to on that one because it 's already in your management plan that you will restrict it to two little craft but if there 's any change then you 'd have to that be I guess the key question that 's been asked as in terms of the reserve itself you 've had some issues raised you 've 've got which is the chain halfway along if you 're ever mind to change that a 10 you in any way you need to go through a consultation process as part of that you can put options out to the community and say we 're thinking of either closure or a chain that right of the chain halfway we as it is now we 'll take that chain down all together what do you think I guess the issue and we raise us in the workshop is that you 'll get a third of the community saying no in a third of the community saying yes in the third same we don 't care so hence it 's about I think putting out a proposal whether their proposal was to support and principal the closure or not as totally over to you human are we talking about the reserve management plan is if you go to page toolbar 400 Alice 's States it may be of some benefit to repeat the consultation but it 's likely it is likely the same results will occur then under policy implications 12 before a decision to change the reserve mentor thing it 's a contradiction i think when i read this through these yeah it we 're not split but by going back to consultation we 're just going to come back the same result or we 're just giving some indication i guess but you have to consult if you want to change your mentor let 's try something like this because legally you have to you see what we 're saying is that ye only to split amount of consultation depending on whether people what the people 's interests are so I don 't think you will get a ground swell one more of the other through the key thing for us consultation was 2009 so if I guess be a lot of mr. change here then residentially as well as Holy home so I think would be wise to go back up of the main look after work the answer I think if he was to go consultation listening you saying to sort their change situation out you 'd have to consultation consultation that 's uh that 's part _''_1044.24 be inconsistent with your measurement plan your measurement plan currently says the chain will be where it is we I think we think it 's sensible to us the public rather than go and do something it 's us the problem there 's no young person to see it was you if we do go out oh is it the proposal to go out with all those options far from status quo probably what I 'm wondering well because um I think with the involvement I 've had with 2050 the boat ramp issue has been raised over the past three four five years consistently and yeah I think it 's being used totally for those that it was not used intended for and so I think I know I 've got to be careful in terms of my preference but there is to make a decision I think we need to consult with the community and I know in saying that the submissions will come back like they 've done previously and it makes a real hard decision but so possibly to help if I could and maybe we into the formal management plan right now we simply go out an informal basis and ask the community so you know a advert in the paper and through the residents associations a mail drop around the area submission process over over a month or whatever we end up doing and then you use that to decide what your next step is so essentially they that will be a pre consultation type process which then you decide then do we go to a management plan review and if so what form does that take that they take our closure does that take a partial closure or seasonal or whatever so it would be a food yes deep in the process rather than I think what I 'm hearing around the rumors the concern that we 're stuck into the legal process the moment we do this and we 're in a place where then you 've got a management plan change on the table when you say to do that you need to have a preferred option and I 'm what I 'm hearing is that you don 't really have well we 're pretty judging really i mean i know you have comes but we are really prejudging the submission process we will go that way if we 're going to do that we could go out with the options as articulated without identifying a preference it could be just here either here 's the issues here 's the options yeah what do you before and why and then you can then you this group Fred can then have the discussion about where do you sit on that do you want to make a do a change or not your worship both in hopes of wise suggestion of Charis what are we going to cover we 're going to cover the traffic chain we have to change bios what 's the whole house the whole gamut really if we burn out our way we can do a pretty effective dell think otha it 's a really good approach to films yeah clarification on the boat green there 's just a piece into the scene and I think I 'll get it I 'll be with you John and they just free launching off thing is hit with a hammer or not for free nothing 's ever produced arena concession gate so that by that that 's had an illegal or legal program it 's not a bow gump it 's not a revolution okay for launching boats yeah if we could take action on that now am innocent playing say is that a management plan says that it 's available for small craft and there 's a size limit on it and you 'll see the signage is there and the problem with that is trying to enforce that and of course when people have to pay on one hand to go down a dia or the cannot marina boat ramp and get this one for free they 're going to try everything they can to do the free option we 've tried to limit that through physical design and that was the reason why these letters are dated when they were is that the resolution that we talked about with the lights of to throw to her at that point was we will live but the size of the and ballads and the like what we found there is there obviously residents don 't wish to pay the marina the launching fees and so they will use the attractors and for drives to remove whatever we put in place you never follow in meter so it comes to cut up hope i thought i 'm really at odd thing am i squish again we paid how much was that report i don 't know tom i 'm sami well 1,500 for you so i needed for years of horticulture of secretary school term the novice when it comes to green fingers stuff but we make paper up we get a specialist and then we still at our own opinion why do we get the report kind of a narrow special poem suddenly when i drove out there more military 's I can 't see brute damaging for caused by cars by mower only I see okay so there 's still evoke you know but why why we pay for a report if we 're going to just add an air inlets anyway which we think should be in there different hurts we were the specialist guys should have given us all that he he is going on that mark damaged my damage he never once mentioned cars this is by oh no we 're never gonna fall out here but we hope we paid someone to do that so either he 's giving us a report that 's not full enough is that or am I just crazy yet for your worship he also gallery we also better report on the conditions of the tree so yes and every year is advising there 's two trees yep yeah they come out the chicken Yeon understand though so but I take your point about the paper specialist voces not good no no no sir not at all no I 'm saying that my observation my observation is vehicle there 's vehicle damage the roots now I 'm not a qualified arbores but that 's my observation that 's what I 'm saying I guess but it goes paper which make biases a decision making yeah that 's one thing it informed choice of sparox has got a suggested amendment and a pre consultation exercise with the community to address the vehicle access and boat launching issues on the clock lakefront reserve so what you want to do registries in their name and the jane deflate see what causes all come together yeah okay there are lots of people locally accessorize others are be home yeah we could actually a coverage that way yeah yeah be flex is in trade minister not manage I 'm gonna further deservedly the chain no it 's not about that it 's about vehicle up its vehicle access because that 's what 's causing the issue thing I want to further complicate this I 'm sorry but if you recall with world place going back to the Fred committee members we limited consultation very much so directly affecting I 'm not suggesting we just keep the place but whether or not you want to limit this to people have homes or our residents off cannot or you want to ask the whole of the general public the general public it just changes the way we approach things yeah okay I think it 's got a choose one comment don 't know how many of you agent site does it and notice it every single house along keep the place has it double gates facing the light and some boats sitting right there reader hash straight onto the roof well makes me not well that 's it that 's another issue and all you got to do become big leagues it 's make it easier for them hmm it 's right yeah i agree yeah your worship only the suggested resolution let 's been read out with a clear you sing at the bike carries this church thank you all those in favor please say aye free reading this real is really really really really radar you everybody that council undertakes pre consultation exercise with the community to address the vehicle access in both launching issues on the chem lak lake without reserve okay community means the community the tap a district community us is Hugh Rowland also have ult a large that 's what I 'm getting in it 's a community at large that 's really change if I may does that imply then coming holiday period the status quo will this man yes okay thank you _"

    "text": "getting that right at the stage thank s well he will know that it 's a nice experience okay the animal management and environmental health fees and challenges mr. Scott them would have to in Scott afternoon so busy just like them take my report is rich I 'm assured very brief summer in to explain what is hopefully quite a simple process so every year we just need to see our dog control V than animal mental health fees prior to the signal VLT penis is basically because we need to get a registration packs out prior to the LTP I 've been adapted so pretty much we need a nearly decision to ensure that we can get those to the printing press as that everybody has those as we over fees and give the registrations done in time p by 2 1 July the LTP is part of it with the drafty LTP we don 't have any submissions on the fees and charges we had proposed to make many changes to the fees and charges there 's only three putting minor changes one to the hours of 25 transfer fee from axillary registration and also just when someone 's fingers a food control plane and additional fee there and because that 's really the way we going forward with food control plane so Spacey isn 't a bit of a disincentive to ensure that someone one of those planes doesn 't step off off their regime any questions okay yeah thank you Scott and I just had one and when it comes to certificates of registrations if you have sort of beauty therapy service businesses or whatnot moved to residential areas are they captured the same yeah yeps emerging great thank you do that

item will can infringe but you can 't specify it and the way this will some of the wording to make that clear is no longer that 300 liability you can store in french at any stage but the way i was weird and made it look like it was part of the actual and banging ville so you need to separate the tube so we 'll just we 've always had the opportunity to do that or just removed it to ensure would

differences is there again any reason why not one hundred percent sure other then just the desire to have the contract are you saying that that particular contractor is trying to buy the business I was more suggesting at the other end of the sale rather than Isaac a sharp end of it okay any other questions of us for us that suggested resolution nearby could have a mover for that piece Gasol emson thank you sickin about counseling all those in favor please say aye it 's against carried item number seven and check the rifle range riotous water main menu sorry yeah you wish it just before we leave item yes the engineer 's estimate was 550 some dollars does that mean that that was allocated in the budget and they 'll be a save in with that that 's right the represent some saving of about 30k a year thinkin total that said 100k you okay item number 7 and 0 and raid this is the one we 've been having problems although these over the last couple years we 've had a few bags here and this is for the renewal of the water main form just up here past the fs right through to kemah moody street we 've got a new new contract with the GT civil we 've done some fairly extensive background research on that contractor to make sure that he 's suitable contractor and we 're quite satisfied with the responses we 've had from the Furious clients that he 's grateful okay thank you for us councillor pack at least thank you mr. so I 'm going to ask one of my usual Christians of you with the duty civil limited being cambridge-based in the others being the top or branches of bigger companies that the secret of the second local best of total businesses the one that would have been the next closest to and GT Civil was there a lot of difference for the contract to be awarded to an out-of-town business as opposed to head I could certainly find out from the vibe i just can 't recall what the second one was the difference between business even know what the highest one was anywhere yeah um yeah I think you know the tendering process is a difficult one we 've got some good standard regulations around that inside and answer the question you know i don 't think it 's fear mr. Lewis can I sort really because the I tender all has one through on price attributes as well as some performance attributes so no I 'm just say the chair I completely understand it but I just hope that if it wasn 't_''_434.03 a hugely significant that our local residents and make hairs Who am contend for these contracts as well that 's just taken into consideration we can look after our own that 's all I 'm saying certainly look the tender process for this particular team to was one where we evaluated the attributes of the tenderers first and then the score seeker and that tends to lock you into an outcome once you 've ascertained what the attributes cheer I 'm mysterious just for clarification this was originally and bundle er unbudgeted expenditure that we approve back in November so which financial year will this expenditure fallen from food on this financial year yes okay and just it 's been nearly seven months since we approved us can you explain why it 's taken us that long to get to this point Susan we can partially because of the christmas new year back and partially what we did with this contract is we once we received approval from counsel for the unbudgeted expenditure we then engaged the consultant to undertake the design of the works and that 's taken as a period of time and then there 's there the tendering of the the contractor self so that 's largely what 's taken the time capsule body well I was busy part of my question because as is unbudgeted wouldn 't that we wouldn 't now consider borrowing as that is a ongoing freh structure capital expenditure because we 've already allocated it is unbudgeted I think it 's at least not raised with custom in henson delegated geek out of that those unbudgeted expense items that have been approved to the year okay all right so adjusted resolution there we get this job fixed up and under way and guess the back standard by council jolons thank you all those in favor please say aye right against Barry Eitel number eight lake terrace this is Malaysian to the war mainframe council building here down to miri road this is the one that we had a number of rapes around n zack weekend because of the nature of those bikes and their commercial properties that have been serviced we 've mended into an arrangement with our Suri waters maintenance contract fulton hogan to get cracking on that and they started that you would have seen them on the ground here on monday but essentially they started last week and this report is seeking retrospective approval for a nun budgeted expenditure of 300,000 dollars to complete that water main well we just add in relation to the questions the council jovens ask to be a hair long it took for rifle range road what we did with this one with the contractor on site to sort out the most effective and cost-efficient way of of renewing the water main so we 've short-circuited a lot of that design and planning phase that we did with rifle range road in through the chair this was budgeted for next year so we just pull it forward so mr. just for clarification of edits son budget the moat so we 're paying that retrospective that 's the decision that would be part of the capital budget but next year yes it 's on the 1516 plan but because of the emergency nature of it we brought the work for lower that be from funds on hand or would it be fired it would be probably out of the renewals budget probably a will be I 'm not understand sure where was budgeted that was over 15 16 year we had three water mains down for renewal rifle range road lake to us and Tim amuto Thank You Julie it 's just one last question for mr. Lewis at notes in the paper that it was some of I mean the pipes are they 've been disturbed who did the disturbing and is there an insurance issue sorry I 'm just having to ask the disturbances around the fiber-optic that was later you 've got a very narrow corridor of about three and a half meters in no there is no insurance liability because there was no direct striking it 's more one of where the surrounding material as disturbed the AC pipe the walls of unsound nature so that any disturbance are joining that can lead to weak points and that 's what 's probably happened here but there 's no liability as opposed to drilling straight right okay thank you mr. Lewis okay I have a move a place for the Steelers Kansas between a ling ling Jie signal by Councillor John ones who goes on faithfully say I since carried assignment of Valles Riverside magnet just occupy wanna afternoon Ella known and this would normally be considered by the reserves committee but we only just received notice that the rib side market had been sold and they need answer pretty shortly to get that sail through so you will have assign up to the new purchases and under the license we must assign the rough side license if they meet that criteria it 's a fairly subjective criteria they have to be respectful responsible and and financial resources and you would have read the report that and it 's suggested that the new pictures can make those that criteria so so you 've got recommended resolution in front of you to agree to consume to the assignment which will take this place next week on the first of june and the other thing that I just wanted to meet you and educate cancel on the load with temporarily allowed the Riverside market to operate from that corner location next to the App Center and it 's just to allow the normal area to regenerate because it 's feeling worn down there so they 'll be operating from that corner site over the winter okay thanks Ellen okay any simple process beloved move and we 've got somebody seeing a broadcaster Harvey just a question from cancer kruszewski and seeing there 's going to be a new ownership and we are criteria is it not autumn opportune time to revisit if necessary the terms and conditions off of the lease no that 's not it 's a rite of assignment so you 're taking the existing terms and conditions the option time to do that would be for a variation process which is the negotiation but this is the new purchaser if they meet that criteria station i right thank you so that opportunity will come down the erection next opportunity will be when the existing license expires witches and and in depth 2019 that we 've just gone through a variation process with them so we 've limited the operating days to explode some major event weekends we still have the ability to toad to splice them up to four times a year FN Aviv needs that area thank you ok thanks Ben just one final question Jon I am part of the criteria is that counsel was satisfied that they meet certain conditions I note in the paper that it is the seller that says that they believe that the new purchase of meats or conditions are you counsel actually state that in the paper yeah o is just a pedantic yeah yeah I am again it 's a hard one that subjective you have to take and people 's word of their experience I haven 't done any fungus investigatory work but I am satisfied that they made it could you yeah I think just their existing their previous position fine fettle that the owners awful for pops by 15 years traded the assay I 'm sure be fine ok counseling and seconded by Councillor Harvey all those in pleasant mood besides its own sake on them yes I body appt cedar to Ambrose ooh that 's a buddy seen about counselor Harvey anything right well as in favor please say aye hi those against Kerry item number ten license to occupy and _"

Williams actually regarding the tires there 's some clarification are those tires being stored there or they being used for the private landowners use the information that we 've been given by other regional councils that they are still there for fun for agricultural use they are not part of the contract for and recycling and my understanding of the regional plan is that there is not nothing specific in regards to disposal of tires and the regional plan for the RMA could apply in terms of a distance absolutely that 's why we 're working with the regional council where investigation ongoing and I would suggest that tires would be doing to be a reasonable pirate pile of tires the Regional Council working on side our staff in terms of making sure that the pile of tires meets any environmental requirements under though this road yep Jim could have full of the winner yes and the body but may need to rob a similar Williams an email honor about the sixth of May in this regards and I was told that it was in our briefs that we get on the Friday through a Waikato paper so I printed off stuff New Zealand code New Zealand I 'm just wondering why firstly it took us so long as a council having nine I believe in that someone will correct me if I 'm wrong prior to this actually taking place and then secondly if it 's prefer muse that means that 's going to be an ongoing problem here for the foreseeable future so what 's your strategy okay not necessarily the best place to answer this question but I 'll try and keep things brief so that we can live on the flu so in this it 's private property it 's a private contractor they 're entitled to school whenever they went to on their own private land and it 's not something that council would generally get involved with there is nothing in our district plan that specifically talks about the storage of tires mary-rose own as is there 's nothing in a district plan that would talk about the storage of wooden piles or or direct cars but certain people want to do that type of activity the killers and the key for regional council particulars to ensure that whatever is chosen by a private individual to store on their land is not endangering our environment and the people within that environment that is where the investigation the work is currently focused with the Regional Council to ensure that that it 's not an unreasonable storage issue and that it doesn 't have impact on the environment of the population that surround that area so that 's the focus that 's the focus of the investigation and the work that they 're doing the nature of the discussions that have been had with there are no new tires coming so it is not the issue that we thought it might be because somebody had suggested that we could get up to 300,000 tires that would be a significant issue an opinion however that 's again up to the Regional Council to deem what they believe is appropriate if it 's for agricultural use I do well myself that when I Drive from here through buildings that I would probably pass just as many tires on that road as we would say a pocket pocket open road at the moment so again it 's neither this councils responsibility to identify the use for those tires but just for us to keep monetary and to ensure that the Regional Council keeps monitoring to ensure that the problem does not become an environmental one so very tricky when it 's private individuals private business on private land I hope that sort of helps it 's not the Phil answer because we don 't have a full answer as I 've yet but all I can say as we 're continuing to monitor in terms of the an article that we 'd actually put into the cases we can update so we informed you at the time that media was starting to be reported are you probably a week before that there was potentially a problem but I didn 't know what that problem was and I didn 't know whether to separate conjecture from from reality at that point in time so I wanted issues of substance rather than issues of conjecture before I reported through the council but you certainly got the reports as soon as i got them good three organized mr. Williams with the I caught the Friday flash as an old to from a previous life a dilemma media releases in our between them consistently for about 18 months but I 've come to conclusion the media releases put out by this office I 've seen because they come at Wrigley as a media release or I read them in the paper I personnel have been my fellow councillors haven 't got time to read all the press releases from the hero of the Dominion the taranaki Daily News to do with 's where it was if the knowledge of that had been prior to the release I did not get it as a separate release via comes to us directly as counselors where it was a report from the regular terms that we included without information so if you 're suggesting that you want us to summarize those releases input the header loose then I can only release or see if we can make do that 'll make it a simple exercise for you are you suing up okay any other questions on the castle kruszewski and on for bar one mmm and the service delivery performance last paragraph we seem to have quite a significant difference offer and targets cheap achieved extra gas for a user 's do we know why that John John song I was looking for journey and it 's fundamentally the weather the the numbers coming through it just not coming through and we had a hot summer so the numbers weren 't as high as it happened previously that 's a typical trend over many years the world noodles the less swimming pools I use chair just to cover just clarifications from fit on your point of view 4.7 you still got the only town center violated revitalization has been complete but that the Estill Satan message was still waiting on a key and sleepiness still think we should put that back to being up and progress for this not complete I 'm happy to note that I think the reports come through from project managers who deem the contractor who complained so it 's just an emphasis of well who 's a booster the reporter but I accept your comment and i 'm seeking leaks through guards to Anzac cried and comes in mesa leave page for bar one bar 12 these promise me about and zak bagans ordered by council around the best record I supposed to tell annoying he said we 've got the arrays it 's real rock church council good thing clarification is that all we got for our sister was it anything else that we funded today just purees is it all we got I wouldn 't have the foggiest out of identity trouble is they 're heroes intense Vegas Barris gains at day goes on the council and I he 'd got the Nauvoo fun wish in the race Sri as well okay just want to clarify the X what we got and finally I 've got to say I won 't publicly said us about young and Damian coops I 'm really impressed with coming from a DG OT point of view so school dear

the drinking water were to go ahead with and that tag would change I would assume because them at the same time specifically for their for the race water and within a room that is more cost effective than running with the water main and we 're proceeding with it he says thank you can sequester ski any other questions of the chief executive council Johnson I 'm just a question through the chair

    "text": "uptight fish is see ya thank you good afternoon counselors this agenda item is basically for the purpose of to update the council on the status of both shall talk water supply and to confirm the next steps this agenda item is presented to the council make as read if you want i would like to go through the executive summary and asks answers to the question if you have any I 'd like to hear through what you have to side in on my equations to follow that up sorry I would like to hear what you have to say for instance in the budget has been quite an upsurge in the initial budget expenditure from which is covered on three bar 3 x 20 and the comment about not all the reason it 's have been spoken to her advised that there are a couple of other issues as well I think the bestest I 'll just go through the brief summary so that everybody 's on the same page the bullsháá book is a small community with 67 properties that are connected to council supply schemes the costs are covered by the combination of target rate and metered rate for this rule supply scheme the source of water is from both within this community there were three booze however one bore has failed and one has been abandoned and one has a declining production in summer the community relies on both remaining moves to meet the water demand therefore there is a risk that if either one bore fails there is a further decline in the water production from the board so that could be a water shortage issue being a rural community because they are they must be having a cattles and hurts their while the system is currently providing sufficient water too the community and there is the immediate short-term risk there is a sufficient restored the development of another source to the council and shows the security of supply the previous consultation with the body shop work residents presented options to provide secure water supply and meet the drinking water standards based on this feedback from the community the decision was made to drill a new board and maintain the system a new board very high arsenic levels in the water significantly higher than the existing board told it we have spent sixty one thousand three hundred dollars to develop this boat the options are now to either drill a new bow in a new location or go back to the community with other options including having more reliance on private roof water supplies the preferred option is developing a deep board it is sufficient budget available to allow this to be completed though there were no further continuously available to cover the cost of another failed attempt the cow capital budget allowed is still in line with the value presented to the community during this concentration face the community were previously strongly in favor of delegate you bore eighty-two percent were in support of drilling a new bow and the situation has not changed significantly to go back to community at this stage thanks REM so what when you 're asking here today is whether you want us to support the drawing of another yeah yeah okay rid the rest of the item so that 's okay we 've got some queries specific you a mesh I just I 'm just not quite sure why this is an agenda item it 's covered in the CEOs reporting yeah so that 's it I think it 's a project update it seems to be a perennial that comes up all the time side here what you 're trying to do you just give us a map type you can have a go for another four but you can 't guarantee it yeah the because there is the dial M I know there is a dilemma we have already spent sixty one thousand dollars on behalf of community and we are trying to go for another attempt though there is a budget available so we have made arrangement with the contract of the you know cost-sharing you know basis we know there is a well-tailored proposal we are negotiating the terms and conditions so that you know I don 't want to spend money because if I 'm again failing with spending 61,000 having a facing embarrassment because there 's a risk of telling a bore specially to that area there is a very geothermal bring the escrow so sweet thank you thank you for that but just help me to understand the figures that you have on 10 by five versus the figures that are shown on free bar 23 much Angus differences please three but they basically just without looking at this numbers of the top of my head what I can tell you initially when we identified there is a serious risk of water table going down or the boars are collapsing so we had a minimum readable budget to maintain the boar or mayor do the minimum maintenance to the ball and that renewable money was spent as a part of preventive maintenance as well as renewals to maintain the casing and then there was a budget allowed to tell another board with the concentration of the community so course may not be there will be some difference seven else but you know if you need details explanation I can get you financial data and send you later yeah what you just asking that counts the parrot bay the badges 294 on three bar 20 different budget on like Carl yeah 2a plus the 66 max 2 294 that the remaining budget available as Leo to Philippi the month before it was 194 so it 's going to make a green yeah just make the point of this particular issue there 's a number of comments made in the document about houses going to solely tank water we 've got to remember it 's a rural area and ninety percent of the order is stock water not household consumption so that option is out so I think that 's what we are recommending to drill another board and just say cap rule from Council that the project updated on this project is going on for a year and we have been trialing out to different depth and the different experience of the border we have used the best experienced person and by peer reviewed by weichert original consoles and so he has come out with the party saying that you know to get a success we have to you even if you are failing he will just charges minimum is cause otherwise we have to pay the equal amount whatever we know we are still negotiating the conditions and I think I 'll try it in it is what we can do for the community im sue achieve the purpose this Piper was just to give you an update we have spent half the money was unsuccessful that the seeking boo was unsuccessful we got a bigger she so you know that 's basically we will add and it 's only fear that you are up to speed with the situation needs say the second balls go efficiencies no nobody could guarantee even hole driller cannot warrant is museum is a risk we can 't k in the fried chicken here you 'd have to come up with an alternative alternating is you know just slightly as I discuss in the option state you know if we can go back to community to go back on the roof water as counselor but he says I know it 's a rural community based on the stock how much they will be dependent on roof water some may have some may not have then they will ask funding from Council so it becomes so we are looking for the best hate spinster mercies and once chi minh today with co waters not really an issue because much the water at the if not all of the guys in the tanks faced the the last board we drilled was a very cold water it was very cold water here but you know but unfortunately when we go to the depth we ended up with having more arsenic so I think that was briefly explained in the report but we tried our best to be successful but that 's unfortunate part okay thank you it was not idle net sailor do I have a mover for the received information 145 thank you get out the dorms seems like counselor whatever so all those in favor please say aye against carried like to number 11 rifle range road water main replacement so give me your getting nervous yes so okay well we 'll just sort of worked out we 'll take this as read because I think it runs read haven 't seen the damage here then cause at least three breakages and last we had is and both are on the left and right hand side of my house I thought I personally it is signaling me something ms you 're walking every day you have to take care o completely mad yes why the question was like these are put me out of nineteen fifty eight or something yes yeah cuz I your life there were due to be renewed anyway next year it was to do linea so busy normal lifespan of a 50 years 30 actually that 's a different topic I think nobody like I can share because it 's sweet okay so what we 're saying is we 're gonna bring this is really budget for the next year 's part of every new so let 's bring it back this year and I ahead of time here 's one here and it 's in case anyone 's have worried I understand from Greek and too long in it most of our work pipes are spaced off so it 's a real not consume you know Draghi is also in under edible plants we do a lot of condition assessment to do the value for money and we can 't spend and renew all the pipe together so we just prioritizing a staging it recommended resolution oh sorry okay now that 's been moved in secret book we have Christians thank you Gossage olives oh just a point of clarification because it 's unbudgeted expenditure will we be deferring something else that 's on our annual schedule so that would come in on budget for this financial year because we 're only six months and just my name from EF if we were on months 11 I might say I 've might feel more comfortable about unexpected expenses such as this the hard way through the year with we have mentioned two councils before that there are events that occur that we need to address and this is one of those events we 're talking here capital expenditure which we as we sign the paper rubric being a tender to counsel in a fairy council meeting so the actual expenditure itself will not be occurring probably until the last quarter of the financial year even though that some sunny Arab will be named to play with major anyway near you don 't want to be saved in their last quarter you 'll be quite the time the first own voice comes up it 'll be around that next I guess junko are you adding to that is also capital expenditure so maybe the interest cost between then and the end of the year that council I 'm just talking about precious obviously looking at the location of that water main I 'm not an engineer but we 've got our water treatment I 'm close by do we need to look at any of the other parts in this area yeah it 's a very good question i have started already the network modeling for those pipes for 1958 which has registered a reasonably good number of life but you know we have gone through those reviews and we are staging them and you as you see there is a good plant renewal is in place for targeting those areas in taupo to Runge and minguk ino Israel steamer we 're not borrowing the money are we so does it it 's very diverse needs to the date it will be barred but we were going to be borrowing it next to any rate it 's part of the renewals was part of the so where does the depreciation but sitting with us the depreciation will be part funding it yes but the difference will be loan funded and I can 't tell you what the exact splitters at this particular point of time so one of the Agins we put forward in regards of s 's renewal is we have to depreciate and that money goes into the depreciation account why 's it always is not enough to cover an event well if an asset costs for example two hundred dollars in written originally and has now been depreciated 200 and the replacement cost is greater than what was the value of the asset in the box then the depreciation account will not be suffice to fund the new asset through that years this little so the point sts renewed every three years it would have some bearing on over the revaluation we budget every three years is it and as we 've seen with the valuation of rating that we 've just gone through it goes up and down right rating drop this time but here 's to say that that a road needed to be replaced in two years time the prices and substantially higher than what the valuation was okay thank you it 's been moved by casting cousins to get a bike Council back so favor please say aye it 's Airy _"

    "text": "item 6 C to take us through this item I 'll come see good afternoon you 'll be aware that officers in conjunction with counselors and through email contact putting this mission to the Waikato Regional Council draft long-term plan and the item essentially seeks endorsement of that submission and if not amendment or additions that you want to make that i can forward and the hearings haven 't_''_27.99 been held yet for the Waikato Regional Council long-term plan there between the fourth from the eighth of May and you 'll see that we ask to be heard sure I was one of those who spoke against that fun but I accept what staff have written in regards of how if we decide to nothing you cut it very well and if there are comments on the or especially up to attachment 1 through you three achieved me thank you you can see this will go to the later version of that strategy for our iniquities they refer to the 54th 54th squirtle in the funding contribution whoa some other world I think there 's the spurt that we 're about reviewing it last year following up on our annual plans mission they said we 'll do it through the long term plan yeah no it 's just gone another way casually training just some of it I 'm passenger transport and ritzy is we 'll look at providing impossible in hansee of service when the contract comes up for tender and 2017 is that looking at the possibility of taking an in-house cell with its referring to was only because that 's been discussed several times and give it 's been discussed in front of them several times and I 've been here I wonder if that 's how they perceive it I think the previous council had an appetite to to endeavor to do that the process that we entered into with the Regional Council at the time seemed to be a very long process and didn 't get any more so if if the skeletal wishes us to pursue that then we 'll more than a Peter to take the matter up with staff again and barrel mode the timeframes that we 're working to we 've something call it just an update off we were in is that what you would you would like yeah I would like to join me on stage a good way a record note that there will be a report back from the regional council this year I would imagine about passion to transport services so possible for organized a workshop in conjunction yep we kan zijn organizer yes please regardless of whether it 's in house or whatever it would be good to have a little bit we can get the regional council offices then let managers say that you can have a robust debate right any further comments on there just sorry that year I 'm to suggest I mean when you speak to the submission I just be very interested i 'm sure my fellow councillors we 're on what sort of questions you potentially get asked or what feedback you get and their hearings process and maybe that 's just an email trail to help close the low participe keen to see how we see how well received this was normally i think it 's the chief general and if they can 't they normally send it on down but that makes good sense to have that feedback loop that would be really good just so that it keeps on top of the mind as we go through this process thank you thank you thank you it 's been moved did we move this one okay okay so there 's a recommended resolution there on the first page of the report so clear the myth Thank You counsel new challenge as some Williamson all in favor all right carried item seven or a meal afternoon all them take this item is read and just open up for any questions above comment on ax fundamentally is just ensuring the continuation of the textfree status of the destination lake taupo trust which is the entity that holds destination great lake taupo being the trading name and you 'll see from the attachments that we 've had a little bit of our ji bhaji with the inland movement and I think with our very astute tax advisors have finally got to a position where they can ensure the continuation of written consent from this council allowing the trust to amend the trust deed to include the traditional wording that your main revenue requires open up for any questions junior 's very wonderful got a couple miss toward its in relationship to the wording when I first read it it states thought this is what we 've proposed didn 't even come back they said it was too wide I 'm concerned with their wording either approve our ID or relate to in the carried out by an entity that is registered text charity and then the brackets and imagine I 've written does that not risk our money rate payer money in regards to a charity that 's not what does it have to perform the same role as destination ultimately that decision will come back to the trust and counsel effectively the the additional wording there requested by the union revenue is really just ensuring that any entity they were to take over from DDOT as in fact the charitable status to avoid it going to an entity that is taxable status but ultimately in a winding-up I left council from my recollection still has control over that to be the way I read that first clause that we were accepting states within the topic district which are the same with similar to the purposes of the trust the recommended view of the Commissioner is to change that where it says carried out by an entity that is a registered tax charity might not change additional to so the existing reading remains but the the additional wording goes on from from the recommended from the Inland Revenue the commissioner it 's not the way we read but thank you for your explanation the government I 'm through the chair and mr. Ward just a question if we amend the deed the Inland Revenue will accept that the exemption applies correct does that mean historically going back over the past few years will they extended it exemption to the date prior to the change of the trust deed and what is our exposure if it is not the case that is a very good question speaking with tax advisors on last Friday the reality is there 's still a question sense would apply and that if they are agreeing that the changing of the wording means that the exempt statuses applicable then one would assume that that would remain to prior years the other isn 't that we 're not so concerned on that is because there is actually already a binding ruling in place on another RTO in New Zealand and exactly the same boat so our tax advisors thinks the ird has been particularly onerous and the changing of this course so their voices that will be it technically and it doesn 't necessarily cover retrospectively in reality they believe a look and should the inland review take a different view then I guess there would be a another process that would be gone down and if that happens that will be brought to our attention absolutely yeah and I guess just just following on from that the tax liability only occurs in a year we we have spent less than budget that only happened in one year so maximum liability even if that did occur wouldn 't be seventy-five thousand dollars 942 dollars as in the annual the questions if not this sound recommended resolution there on the front page we 've got a member and a seconder for that resolution please Thank You counsel pod there 's no training all in favor move on to item 8 it 's the castle engagements sorry Tina but I just like to draw counselors attention to the Fred meeting we are having

the chair will take this as read and then move tag team to answer any questions it 's realistic outside and don 't mean to be seems a little bit pedantic but and on three barrett and a wastewater of his the galley planting program and removal of the blackberry has commenced but you shouldn 't play about 7 fc 's it 's been complete so that just won 't be a church instead of a train go so we should have had the pages round the other way no because then it would have started on 37 are being completed Ontario it 's neatly message machine in peace I wish I just just a comment I think it could be the double up of item 3 by 6 i 'm tired but I 'm hoping we have installed 10 because on pages repo rate have also installed another five so 3 by 6 we we 've got it on the wastewater we 're talking about employer pots now have we installed 10 or are used all 5 + + 3 bar six that says they 've been installed in 358 the additional five our plan to be installed this month yeah save that time if it would be 10 oh ok i thought we 'd only allocated five okay but Wells do it all up on that yeah no that 's good if we if we 've been been able to endure town that 's great yeah the wheel will follow and throw that probably just a double of the thing okay any other questions of the gfs report what bloody so Stewart three about 10 and I might be wrong but I thought that the the purification system at don 't they have been taken care of but here it says that design workers currently underway so the fit things for the period of the report the design workers under was under way now it is completed thank you just cover of issues on three bar to the CEO Mitch it 's about to the workshop the other day we are going to allow we 're going to get our bin size down to 120 liters by the property can have to it seems a bit of a contradiction Moses took with your 240 s the other one was to do with the protozoa removal from water it 's both on 3 by 2 and then later on it was a three-bar 14 it 's some concern that we spend a huge amount of money on a water treatment plant that is struggling to perform as the specifications no doubt should be what 's the kickback for it not kick back but what 's our claim if those facilities don 't get corrected short knees query regarding the 240 noodle boots my 20 litre buns I think we would something pretty well the other day that intent is to reduce see the register you get to 40 here we reduce the number of them volume of the actual ticket I 'm so you 're right in terms of our spoons and evidence from around the country is that by reducing the size of goes to landfill when you 're limited information we gave you from Auckland and other places with regards to that in terms of the the water it 's not a matter that the the water is enough to standard it 's just that you 've got to have tested for 12 months and reported and we haven 't been up and running for 12 months so we haven 't got those reports so the water itself doesn 't not meet the standards this is the reporting processes around that I 'm three bad to it states cheering in manga keener they 've been going on within 12 months yes if you look at page three bar 14 under counter shoes and read that first bullet point that 'll explain it there where it says that the report fraternity main Tino has been produced however requires some amendments and for tow port the wastewater treatment plant monitoring data has been produced from the plant and reporting for matters to be finalized so it 's a place water there 's water would that 's water water treatment plant wtp rather than waste a reporting issue in terms of timing and in formatting rather than I wanna make it quite clear Heather there 's nothing wrong with the quality of the water is people turn the tabs on it just states compliance cannot yet be demonstrated for any water supply coming back to you 120 bins I get the point of the 240 let 's reducer read all the stuff from the workshop at that word shop it was stated you can have 21 20 bins that 's one of my clarified is it not correct yes yes if you believe them mr. feet it 's been even as you can have for ya or if you pay for but not reducing the lean fault say the evidence says them on the country yeah reducing the size size does park ok cancel by andys thank you just just in regards to wood hogging which I have to say showed my favorite phase in this whole agenda and on three power 15 in the word getting seat directory actually does that cost us or jury do they just can link pay us for the is now and you guys battling gladly

    "text": "and it 's would you like to introduce yes co-partner here I don 't think we 've met no like to introduce Michael Cordell he 's asset manager for will most what may be known to some of you but I 'm headed in recognizing Mike 's basically a tap on shore park man he does a lot of our work and the water and wastewater area and then I 've got him alone and to talk about the water no he scheme he 's been involved in it for quite a period of time and he he can talk about all of the details and just we before we go on and through the cheer just like to advise of an amendment to the recommend resolution number three and the reason that items were a resolution jury should need authorizes the CEO to sign the subsidy agreement for 1 million nine hundred and forty-two thousand two hundred and fifty dollars in stops the assay everything after that some is deleted just make sure you Memphis a clear on it and and just borrow a little bit of a background have subsidy for the upgrade of the drinking river at botany and the it was successful in entire obtaining and their application we win design phase and encountered difficulties with dealing with astok and it became cost prohibitive to deal with that arsenic for that small community so that contract terminated and we looked at other options in a favorable option was to reticulate the town from tablet engine that application was made to the Ministry of Health and subsequently we received approval for 1.9 million dollars and I 'll now hand over two nite to just blurt line rattled involves thanks Dennis there 's quite a bit in here so I 'll just run a quick summary rather than go through it by word but you go so sdss mentioned some of you may not know the small scheme that we have a whiter new at the moment is only 37 properties and this subsidy is looking at providing water to the full why Tony which is a total of about 200 11 properties so to do that we would be running pipework from top o what the idea scheme so the white a new scheme wouldn 't exist anymore I would just merge on the route between top and white a new is obviously five mile Bay which is a another 103 properties five mile Bay are not eligible for the subsidy but we think that if we work to put pipe work in so weiter new it should certainly consider five mile bay near benefits including five mile Bay and it 's basically a bigger cost share the more people you have on you know participating cheaper others however would be more expensive for those of five mile Bay then at way to know because of it make a subsidy for then some of the key issues so our water treatment plant capacity so check that the capacity of the plant is okay we 've got 25 thousand cubic meter a day supply out of that plant it 's been a couple of days in the last four and a half years we have daily data who have exceeded that and that was when rainbow point was still in use so that plant was built to that demand management and conservation and improve our fish efficiency in our use of water that 's something we 've continually another important point is that subsidy does not include firefighting so above the an extra cost i guess to the scheme is firefighting supply which we recommend is included that would be in line with our code of practice firefighting doesn 't necessarily have to be included but we 're recommending it it is so there are three options we 've identified by Turner connecting to the water supply on its own white a million five mile by connecting all the status quo which is no new connection and we really recommending option two which is y tener en five mile Bay some financial information in there high-level talks about shows the costs of the scheme and a split showing the relative cost share between whites a new in five mile Bay probably the line at the bottom is the one you look at we 're expecting that above the subsidy there would be have to be a contribution of around two thousand eight hundred dollars for each connection at and you know some the next page it there 's a typo there it says five thousand seventy this page at 6070 should be 6070 so we could those extra costs for those two communities could be covered through a targeted rate I versus a ten-year period which is subject to you know that could be ten and fifteen years we need to work these things out probably through consultation and so I just once the scheme was once those two communities were to join they would pay top o water rate or charge cubic meter charge whatever was applicable as well as repayment of the extra some those are given in the report so we would be looking at a total of around eight hundred and fifty dollars for white samui and thirteen hundred dollars for five mile Bay that 's assuming a ten-year period after which time they would both revert back to the standard tougher water right there is some benefit to taupo water uses white and reconnecting and that the rates that that skip those communities would contribute would be more than the costs of operating I think we pretty much will read I just thought I 'd like to move the recommended resolution see public view about privilege your dimension disappeared just on six power 5 the last paragraph 10 year plan would we be if we were to go down that road would we be awesome to look at connecting up the airport to the wastewater if what two ice waters different project is what you 're going past it the question you asked out some of us when we acting up the wastewater we talking about water here did you mean connect up the water you saying to connect wet white are no you sewage network to tap out at the name that was a project for connecting what annoying to tell pay for the wastewater the intention surface was to go here though it happen at the same time for some cost efficiencies so my question still stands with the airport if you 're going past the airport to go down to white annuity and five mile back would you connect up at the airport and the project that we 've got and five mile bay back in the tough oh for the wastewater and designer that infrastructure were making sure that these provision that the airport can 't connect women in this too yes that does promote specific provision at the stage to make that connection plus you 're not on six bar three you talk about the capacity of our plant here at the moment twenty-five thousand cubic meters yep and this has the capacity to extend it to 30,000 with it through the addition of addition of membrane modules and pumps that they fall as part of that 860 their 10-year payment of h-60 a year no no okay so how 's that how does that work we 're not proposing any capacity increase to the top of water plant those mentioned that you can here 's the cake as you know the stage of the state okay secondly the 860 and or 10-year payments does that include the what the residents are paying for the water here now the 44 whatever it is so the 448 is the line above which is the top I water it yeah you 're looking at the table the bottom table no at the top table okay so if you flick your ID on to the last table 300 you 'll see let 's split their the 448 it 's on it 's over at eight sixty first of all 48 its Lumia and other questions counselors council jolin through the chair might just a question I was just more out of interest the current 37 properties that are connected at weiterhin Louie obviously they 're not covered they 're not part of recovering these capital costs but the costs that they 're currently paying are they were covering that from another investment previously or what 's situation with those guys there are standalone scheme at the moment and there they pay their own targeted Warrick for that skin so at the moment they 're paying is actually very similar for them 53 I think in this proposal we haven 't suggested that those reasons contribute to the capital cost of this they 're already on our water scheme but it could be some apportionment I guess it 's I just want all if you thank you consecutive in favor all right thank you _"

    "text": "out of the things like coffee target 30 to 50 completion so move on to item 5 oh oh I just bet to move the suggestion resolution good afternoon good afternoon just introduced the item yes it looks as though it 's going to be bit of a mechanical ones so the backgrounds of us is that we 've received a indication from the local and bowling and sports club that they are no longer viable as a club they wish to wind up and as part of doing that they wish to sell their premises on the wiper hehe reserve they premises are already occupied by Kitty caught proved on an after-school program out of the building and and behind the bowling greens the back part of the bowling club lease area is occupied by the typo community gardens trust so they there I guess two options today one is that the council can consider the request of the lab in Bowling Club to surrender the Elysee but require that they remove all of their improvements in reinstate the ground and just turn it back into reserve which is work with the current occupants of the land and allow the Bowling Club to realize some of the value of their assets and to transfer the assets to Kitty Corp and continue to allow the land to be used by critical to our community candy and by the top o community gardens trust now you may be wondering why I 'm not recommending in this case that we need to change the management plan in order to be able to process applications for new leases and the reason I 'm treating was slightly different to the previous item is that because in this ace the management plan simply doesn 't contemplate the use of the bowling club area for these purposes when we last meet with the bowling club back in 2009 when we were doing the management plan they were quite strong they had joined forces with a country music club they had a lot of members there was no suggestion at that stage that they wouldn 't continue so it wasn 't_''_182.44 that the management plan didn 't allow new leases it was just that it wasn 't purposes aren 't provided for in a management plan they not contrary to the management plan either so in this case if we wanted to go down that track it would just be a case of advertising they intend to grant leases for other purposes in that area so Alison the community garden trust did they had it how did we how did we treat them they don 't have a lease then they just pops the memory of them in the corner didn 't because it was a pop them in there to see what would happen and because at that stage we weren 't sure that they would be viable so we just gave them a bit of time and space to get themselves sorted and see all come back and do all that later and that was about five years ago so this is probably a very good time to sort that out because they may be a bit of juggling of boundaries between the community gardens trust and kitty Corp and that would enable this process would enable that to work itself out kristen 's kitty have concerns over then taking over release where there was a community-based activity and they 're running in a commercial business and um and I sort of you going back on what we 've just discussed i 'm not i 'm not in favor of and just talking to them directly i prefer option 3 where we go out and advertise it to the wider and community because there may be other activities which malaria and so will though perhaps there is a need for a kindergarten in their area i 'm i 'm not in favor of the least being granted to Kittyhawk than the first instance I 'd like I 'm more in favor of option 3 where we go out for alternative proposals I did raise it with Wayne from critical when he came in to talk to us then they do have two branches to the business one is the full commercial daycare operation where you take the child in at the start of the day go off to work come back at the end of the day and it 's you know fully commercial operation is session-based and it 's free and it 's based more around the need the needs of appearance in children to allow the children to socialize with other children when the community rather than to allow them to work and he they also have two structures to the organization they have critical limited which is the company and they also have a trust so the least could be granted to the trust if that was an issue in terms of the business setup of the company you know I 'm still like to go out and be completely open and transparent about the site I 'm hugely in favor of the community garden but I just think that we need this is this if we do this it 's a long-term commitment and I just think we owe it to the community to go a bit broader than the nexus my own piece of my opinion obviously Allison did we not have an application from kt corp there was going to buy that Oh purchased the house on the side of the car parks and years ago was that kitty dwelling on the other side of the car park yes they do and they 're holding met in my back pocket until this is resolved and so that 's a fallback option for them and i also see where they talk about a 30-year lease that 's what they 've requested reserves that allows us to grant up to 33 years and the RMA allows us to go up to 35 19 something used to be 19 yeah used to be 19 years 364 days but the RMA has changed the the other option is that if the lakeland bowling club were just to walk away from this we would potentially have the reliability of dealing with the building and the greens and all the improvements on there because if they 're now getting to the stage where they not viable to run as an organization then they would find it very difficult to deal with a disposal of those improvements themselves and they may just fall into council 's hands because getting because kelly cog we 've got the two separate arms and one is the community arm that free kindergarten two to go in an area Jimmy 's look just my topic council sure just Google demen up and gets only limited amount of community candy 30 hours free for three to five year olds conditions apply which gives the website which is the free preschool zone yeah always videos free service and a limited time so there is obviously commercial beat to it as well videos pretty sick living alone he 's all right yeah that would be how they are making money but just to learn them for the 30 hours which we get more money the government pays it extra money that that 's apparent would normally pay and they 're just limiting them to that amount hours so they get next news I 'm saying it as still free 30 hours but yeah i 'm a bit thing about that i 'm going on prior you know and this is going to be a commercial lease like what kind of what at least are we looking at offering and for the land because that 's a commercial venture so as an initial rates it weren 't leasing an area of council reserve they would have to be leasing an area of private land on a commercial basis so yes yeah yeah so that 's kind of failure so it does for this particular person who has a commercial value we would have to get that valued by a valuer should that be part of the different resolution venus this is a commercial entity that we go into least two well if it if it was to be part of the consultation that was to be held with the community and they were to ask that question there would be useful to have a decision from council if you wish to make a decision now whether us to be on a commercial basis we can do it the one company one candy when we 've got a lot of breaking these throughout the district who wouldn 't be entitled to the same and the other thing it currently is it right that their own you 're doing that after school currently currently there are new to any other school so basically we 're allowing them should be putting it out there so in the other day care can can sit up a new business potentially there 's always an option uses line with ya it has it has been identified that there is lack in that community of preschool here in education so that would be an option obviously if council wished to make that area available for that purpose would be to open it up to anyone and then any any business that set up there every charm the other every three and four-year-olds be eligible for those three hours yeah look if they work full-time on the position on every channel the others will you jump in fairly quickly and move there 's a Chester resolution well I 've rid of this achievement I 'll go to see why we debating how they run their business lets up clean they also state with the additional area here they talked about a Montessori kicked out and kindergarten a full day care facility for infants so I see no reason why we should not grant them what the rapids i move the resolution you still oh yeah secret like this be cool no I both like a generous support council bodies to you on the 13 th I 'm a little bit them at puzzle is that we 're supporting this we 're almost going country to what we just did before on one hand where we 're saying we 're not going to go out to consultation and then the very next step we 're saying we 're going at going out for consultation on the reserves management play so I 'm not sort of yeah there was some prep CLC 's reiterate her view on that the originally sorry what was that which was two and one is that if you were to make this decision and there 's a resolution that 's been moved in safe never to be debated then you would be doing it on the basis of the information on the report which includes the fact that the Bowling Club is struggling financially and you as the landlord would have got the issue of the buildings of the Bowling Club can 't remove it you 've got a commercial a as a governance body do you say no full stop what do you say we 'll go out and test the market generally or do you say we 've got a bird in the hand it 's the same n bits treat with that person and that 's totally over to you I think it is consistent with whatever you decide is consistent with the last decision making because there 's a specific set of circumstances around them just in following on from that if one were to be of the mind to agree with that with one or two minor amendments would that set a precedent for other future uses of reserve and just to ask if we did go out and ask if anyone else was interested would we lose these people possibly did you say that but another option they do have another option so potentially if the delay doesn 't work for them they may exercise that other option the other difficulty is that if we were to go out and test the market what we get back might not be able to work with they may not be able to easily utilize the the assets they might not wish to purchase the bowling club building so the bowling club would end up out of pocket council may end up having to remove the buildings and provide a clean site for a new tenant whereas the offer we have on the table at the moment utilize as the existing buildings so the bowling club can realize some of the value of their assets and council doesn 't run the risk that we 're going to end up having to deal with an abandoned building so I 'm hearing that it 's probably more useful to take the bird in the hand which is visible which is logical and doesn 't sound like we 're going to have a lot of other interest there is less risk associated with that option so by going out we could lose these people potentially yes but I just want to be really clear here we don 't own the buildings that bold and clever in the buildings okay there 's two separate issues here so when you 're thinking bowling club not by council and offices advice would be not to have a liability on that site should the walk away that liability needs to be removed I could support the suggested resolution but I am concerned they 'll probably the lease rental and it being a commercial entity they kitty call and I think this should should be something in that first Clause to flag a commercial lease rental as opposed to a community mr. chairman we will leave in the difficult is secant the mover and seconder to agree you coulda mean point one to say authorizers consultation on the proposed new litres of parts of wiper heat you reserved a kitty Corp limited million guns trust sorry kitty Pop limited on a commercial basis and the top or community gardens for us because the guns trust doesn 't is it there 's a yeah I 'd be more comfortable with with that type of resolution movie I 'm not agree to you you 're it agreed enjoy yes agree with that in schedules oh yeah mmm then we gated yeah yes yeah well Mackin then we we thought you can go to the upper market but you don 't own the Bauman 's yeah they do well within parameters who have to come back here again it 's us be clear the risk of debt commercial basis is that if you put in sister risk him which is highlighting it out says how role was that the negotiations between the bowling club urban kitty quickly to come by offering us and the ER of that falls over then you 're the risk because they 're kitty hawk walk away bowling club have nobody we get me for the building because probably clever with work but that 's a risk last one of us yeah I 'm concerned just what make sure that council doesn 't end up with a liability then could I conference I guess the bowling club can recoup some of the investment it made of that there in Texas if they don 't find talent Charlie and Allison you 've talked to these people are they expecting her to rent this as a community when not and I mean now they 're expecting we need to say that no problem they won 't walk away because their purchase in the house on the side of the car part is going to be far more expensive than leasing this or even purchasing it from the bowling club okay so just one more question for me before I vote on this are there any long-term plans other than this activity for that reserve not for that specific part of the reserve if you look in the back of the that 's the concept planned out of the sports ground management plan so as you can see their area is ring-fenced as the lease area because at that time there was no expectation that that would change we had identified the area and behind it for youth play facilities but that 's really not high on the list of priorities for carrying out and then there 's the road link that runs through into the EU l land so that 's that specific area no there 's no alternative I cannot play the devil 's advocate against it very much against our mind ya know which for a new park or reserve don 't be i think i know what a croquet croquet okay just like it was they just don 't know i 'm really doing up there greens i don 't think they want to move road there 's one club that was looking for bigger premises not Kirko okay hey struggling as well and that club have talked about growth but the reality is look at the age profile in sleek really all right well it it the amendments been accepted by the mover and seconder I as the counselors to vote on the suggested resolution all in favor against Kerry item 6

Muir with the signage on the infant down of South only a small towns got to be the traps and all sorts of things that their interest to the care and people keep sending me couldn 't we have something better here mr mia so i think that 's a fair question and i 'll leave your question Mr Graham will surely be reached I 'll rejoining the meeting now but I will hold it back up when he comes back in the roommate just to follow up yeah I 'll bring it back up when he comes back during council Williams ok another question regarding the ATA is more a maintenance and enhancements the cycleway a lot adjacent of a tiara right along there last week and it 's this quite a serious weed problem who 's responsible for maintaining that cycle track GTA the cyclist as a cycle along the travelers is very few of them must I mean in it I may be using my trainer that 's daddy nice to solve them it 's a bit of a user and losing people aren 't gonna use it they 're gonna lose it that 's a problem along ETA on say the islands of Iraqi and all that reading speeds pouring out here nothing 's been done to them at all I 've actually seen it myself and i think i mentioned to you mr. CEO I said his bloody disgraceful at the moment I 'm not talking about growing native trees running but they won 't even mow the grass does we 'd shoot now the bridge it look terrible perhaps a letter T inside T am um there was a meeting held on monday between entity a fulton hogan and ourselves just to just to get things on the right track going forward either ask about this yes is working progress which is a shame cuz that was a really quarter bridge pretty it was a really pretty bridge but then I that pretty with weeds hanging out of it everywhere okay so now we 'll move please team members to the handout financial highlights remembering ending 31st 202 11 you 've got your actuals what was budgeted and what your actual czar so starting on page your one which is yep the this fun page one is all hunky-dory we 'll move over to page two and the income statement comes Williams um yes can I just ask a question of our CFO just ask asking please to explain the adjusted the budget comparison taking into account the adjusted makes it quite difficult for us to see you know we 're the savings are from rationalization and I understand there 's different impacts on different different lines of expenditure but that 's still won 't be interested to know why it 's been done like that on and make the point that it is quite hard then for us to see this some of the savings that have been made that the savings that eventuated from the restructure were built into the annual plan so the budget numbers allow for the restructuring and the subsequent savings in that regards the actual expenses directly relate to the budget the only difference is that some of the budgets have had to be spread evenly over the year instead of being phased because when we did the restructure we then had to restructure the whole to account the new staffing levels from previous time that the staffing the the centralization of premises everything else of that regards I think the question that 's coming from comes awareness what is the saving the savings have been built in the budget what you 're comparing is the actual that has occurred against the budget the only difference can be some aspects of timing where some budget lines we 've had to divide by 12 as we 've redone the budget vs properly phasing over the whole year so we 're with for example at the moment was showing that in the current year for employee expenses and the budgeted employee expenses for the year of 18 point three million you can see that we are comparing fifty percent of that and that 's why I 'm saying some budget lines based on the fact that we did the original budget under the old structure and then redid the financials flying on the new structure we 've had to divide some of those lines by 12 per month and remembering that the was from the fourth of april the plans already in place so what we 've had to do is say okay if you look at the employee expenses as eighteen point three million a year which is nine point 150 for the half year we are showing a positive variance against that budget but that 's probably more of a timing issue by the end of the year we 'll probably in line with budget and that 's where I 've referred to in a number of these variants lines that there are timing issues but the budget itself is related to the new structure would it be simpler if the question was put the budget this year for employee expenses which I think come to William just trying to say is 18.3 yes we 're on budget yes we 're ahead of budget slightly but it could be a timing issue could be a timing issue okay what was the budget last year for employee expenses I don 't have that information in front of me so we 're getting somewhere now what we 're saying is that there 's somewhere around about a three is this what you 're looking for yeah I 'm getting it out slowly now we 're getting about a three-million-dollar sated if you want to look at it in those terms well I guess that 's what you 're asking is it yeah but i 'm still it was aight voice is a great many however this budget that was prepared was prepared for the new structures there are no savings in this budget because they were already father was budget for but what I 'm trying to compare it with the helm cancer Williams here is last year 's budget it may be worth while helping in terms of having a look at last year 's budget it would be very difficult to compare them that 's something like salary costs should be fairly straightforward so Counsell Williams gets last year 's financial update from 20 10 when she was elected in October said it would have been one under symbol with me January those answers will be there you can go line by line on your budgets yeah but we yeah it is there will be some budgets might know their savings so I won 't be able to come here line by line so to avoid the question was on the employee at its gym through the chair that 's not necessary comparing apples and apples either because the level of capitalization of labor last year was far greater than the level of capitalization of labor this year because we were doing far more capital works so we 've had to expense more salaries this year than we experienced last year whose capitalization so comparing year with year is not necessary apples and apples Danny a guide key thing is that is the budget that we signed off on for this year and this is where we set against that budget still finding it very difficult um that all variances I think I thought we agreed that they would be five percent or lease and a hundred thousand was real 50,000 must mean he 'll it and it would be helpful if any line item with a variance over that would have a note attached hurt please move to those oh it doesn 't it 's my own page next page here 's an item heat losses on disposal effort assets 237 thousands of snow yeah I know that but there 's no that won 't Lea 's over 100,000 but that doesn 't have one yeah I know and over the top of next page H doesn 't hear me nothing attached to them oh there 's 237 oh and just as an example under other it 's pizzas include he 's an item of 237,000 on a loss but it doesn 't have a reference line and toilet so that 's not explained but there 's a number on the of of that nature pretty 1 million last year it 's 18 million this year 's around about a three million door saving not yet come for scenes the internal 35,000 your worship wasn 't the scenes Kevin Barry issue Oh a bad council employee it 's behind I Wales was just informing me going back to your previous question that in his memory is around about a three-million-dollar saving and employee expenses he 's just asked the staff to bring it up for 's good thank you mr. Williams I 'm not really worried about the seats on the end of it yeah go back to where you were pleased that supposed to mean in it okay um there should be that the letter A against that losses on disposal of assets and if you look at the the E in that second after number three you 'll see it 's related to the loss on sale of 66 norm smith street and the old dog old dog pound oh yeah that is well that brings feels against budget that 's just feed it 's just a type odds yes I should be later e against all those are furious oh thank Kerry that 's all that brings me on to a question so we 've sold the dog dependably I never signed any cell to cell since agreement I 'm asking for sale but that 's the you 're right the right down here okay it 's not sold yet that a CSV a loss on disposal of properties i know we sold Norman 's mystery but I didn 't know it have write anything further under there I realize it 's for sale look oh hehe we have a dog Pam for sale anybody watcher webcams on stuff just trying to promote our assets for the general well-being of the district right we have anything extra please I 'll move on to page two we talks about variances greater than minus or plus ten percent or thirty thousand dollars any more on that page moving over to the next page where we clarified that we don 't we haven 't sold a dog pound yet wool moving on to capital expenditure update to 31st to zimba please remember december two thousand eleven you also speak to the store Miss Bennet or just take a page by page every dancer questions okay Counsell Williams um this is just getting better I know there 's a major now I 'm the notes to the revenue from significantly companies note 1 a and of those the total variance is 1.3 22 million and off that as 880,000 and I just like to ask mr. men he not I understand this is the these these explained to us it must be a cash flow nightmare do they is there any way of getting NZTA to to pay in more smaller tranches and they only pay relative to what we 've spent on a pre-arranged agreement the this is as much an accounting entry as anything else but given the example of the ETA we spent the money creating a asset capital asset the subsidy came in to us as revenue and this is how this is actually working as well as we spend money creating a capital asset and roading the subsidy comes them but for accounting treatment we 've got to bring it in as revenue so we do I find the concert event from a thing of they say see how do I know that if you look at down and the for example in the capital expenditure update there are areas they 're under transportation for example where we 're currently 345,000 behind budget as far as capital expenditure is concerned that will be one of the elements that flows into that 880 there will be areas of maintenance and renewals in and the other factor is that that subsidy budget is being evenly spread through the year where a lot of the work actually occurs from through January febri March so we would expect over the next two or three months for that deficit to diminish quite dramatically 345 as a total under transport and where did you say the rest there ubi elements within the the maintenance expenditure and some of the other particular expense lines as I explained there are aspects of timing issues because as I say in evenly spread over 12 months where a lot of the activities and those sort of areas occur january-february aspect of summer so you get a boost in the actual expenditure and I would expect to see that variance diminish what I 'm having the team do at the moment is revisit to see whether we can adjust the phasing a bit more to sort of match the what 's actually happening exactly yes uation yeah i see on on page one we 've got we find in and also on page three or four we 've also got we find time to ask Gareth a question about yeah I was going to bring it up sculptures on it sure is that finished did other sorry if you yeah so scoffs on ETA i is that other one first year council heckling brought up before that there was allowed it was even do something for wayfinding and the issues come up about these entrances to town in John so absolutely so the 770 was for the clip n whole thing ends for those sculptures we still have the money sitting there for the sculptures as you 'll remember we bought our second passport back to council some ideas for three of those those entrance ways it was white RK the airport and centennial thing broadlands brought unto us 565 and then we went down to 30 was Napier Napier was an opiate open wide open three big ones so I went from five then we went to three essentially the Council of the stage at that stage said that the the one the sculptures that were they were suggested didn 't recognize the the local area go and consult we 've there for the last couple of probably 18 months and it 's been incredibly frustrating also in terms of the speed of their project I 've told the team that their money must be committed by the end of this financial year EG end of june otherwise we will we bring back to you some more butts off a shelf because of it proves to be that we can 't get anything else due to cost all difficulties then we 'll bring you back the options and you can make the decision what actually happened I don 't know Barry 's at the meeting but what actually happened about this big bicycle thing for heavy is not happy okay well that 's clearly that 's going ahead yes it 's been approved ok cool I 've dead georgeous jog my memory so it 's paid for work in progress that 'll be up to say a top of control gate hill or have you gotten off yep or paternal and the other one up we 're negotiating with turangi to get some contribution from those are we going they separate budgeted for we 're still struggling in the consultation process to find what everybody 's happy with still happy yes sorry guys just did did the way for the clips because I 'm not just looking at on this page it refers to 390 teeth did the clips was that the amount of money spent on the clip was that it only leavers probably about 200,000 he 's great so there was clip and in the work that I mean in the work they 've been done to date on the on the gateway sculptures and some other elements such as the flagpoles that we did you know your hands on it on that leaves closed on 400 how much does that figure this free 90 so nearly 4 400 775 probably about 300 300 300 thousand each which is we were budgeting about a hundred hours insurance for insurance yep that 's right the difficulty and you saw today what you can get fo you know there 's a lot of money but the difficulty is when you 're getting something custom-made the price obviously goes up so damn that same line I see we 've got the laneways and we 've only spent 13 are we still on track with doing something down on the laneways yes we talked about from starlight to the back of running for yes absolutely will be bringing something to you hopefully the next council meeting to show you that the proposed designs i get to sign off on that counter dinner i just want to just Gareth how many all the clips finished and how many we ended that one they are all finished unless we end up with some some more money at the inn so what we 'll do is post the sculptures if there 's some money left we might put one or two more in the exact number 14 14 sculptures 14 clubs you know we can last night in the one down by riverside park I mean that auricular fantastic here here lighting on there they add a little bit of color to our community and in vibrancy you know you 're not dark here like they 're there just stands out brilliantly I 'm sure you them didn 't follow the plan part because you can 't read all the woods weird in these little bits which snuck in behind the excess after they obviously didn 't there 's a few hey you know they 're great I see tourists reading them every day and all the history about things that 's great there 's a few teething problems the one the big thing on that one in your right some of the the words are behind the behind the Clippers develop but you 'll remember that those boards are transferable we can take them in and out very easily so in time we will change them in in May there a little bit of fantastic yeah I really agree I agree with counter down I 'm sure fellow councils agree got us what some little Reuters might say I think they 're fantastic their innovative and they really set the scene being with a purchase great too its just oh yeah ok where were we sorry sorry I was William _"

I guess is going to form a wheelchair in your office spective things but this but there 's obviously public information I love have us on e-mail when it can see and because in some questions if you say to someone actually all look fittest may be finished by July which I believe it 's nice here you make communist female counselor Johnson just from his obviously story in the paper and sections different too some elements of the story that the Australian two people perception is reality they don 't know the other side of the story it 's just unfortunate that our local paper you know sometimes Percy 's mail district in a feared light and it just concerns me you know that here we were struck upon central government on what they believe local governments doing and then reform and you know they are own district here through a part of our district and the papers teaser just so be so negative and what they write in the paper is really conclusive is a sort of make that comment because we all in here and strive to do the best because we 're passionate at the district and the different Avenue Sibley lifestyles that we come from where exposure nicely that 's family any other there speaks in our lives and it can wear it sometimes you know generally the front page news is generally something actually have time officers the right where to we paid with it today and this nature is just to show that came on board of your concern but what we appreciate now is the feedback over the next week you too as to whether it is this is a little detail that you want to see other

so primarily that 's where we are members a recommendation sat on the on the books which have come to counsel for further discussion and and all those solutions ok go to that up then I would you be able to us cram did they give a reason what I wouldn 't time Jordan negotiations give a reason why to allow the name changes provide sorry Sarge are ya so she was doing on my other thing is that they legally could and so that 's why they asked themselves forward by elyse up with you um I mean that was me also we what is I think that 's counselor say that my understanding is it 's mr. boaters we 've gone gone through these following recent conversations with other you know this is color for the primary service officers taking up to another doing stand any more on that council but I just say that the legal settlements a 14th anniversary will be tomorrow taking 14 years to be here another four months perhaps otherwise this won 't be our sentence of time aboard in 20 Utica since 1998 had a number of discussions it was one change made to for example Todd place from tomica we grow that I think there was we followed the only street name since I 've been many in the last five years James now the only two could afford these names backwards which the board has made a recommendation and for now lots of other things have come out of the woodwork and some some of the issues coming injuries comenta what the poor Topsy is trying to that Jesus issue but like huge honors we do a cost about Mike Ross councils in the wider community but says individual errno has no I 've nothing here we don 't want to know that the changes will hold of it then and I think that 's quite an important part of an open concept with us today but in response that the process go forward is we have to literally visit each business effective business and sit down and work out what 's federal cost is to that and how when it council would support that cost and bring it back to accord there 's a whole process to go through in terms of the customers and us being clear throughout and that 's why it 's a stage process because there are significant costs which are unbudgeted for which we that leaves consequence our hammocks it 's okay we 've got some guide estimates in there based on previous previous loan name changes but they just guide estimates among those look the supporter of a kind of information that i was already it 's been a bit car for us because until we can till you can 't_''_302.03 go Alvin say this happening actually can such as resolve the most value in your mouth disease just the coin there aren 't any businesses over all affected with these street value changes for example extending iona road up to the police station from high school like there are there is the town center for those at the town center address not only owner otras rainier businesses that I think I affected along there with the mustard seed the BP the video shot a fraud diri in the computer shop jean tigana I can 't the document just for clarity if we go back to when the maid was used to build township of the power who the names and a suggestive preferred options way they peed in the old world of that being named it wouldn 't be i 'm not sure i 'm actually selected on speculation because the original agreement was to receive names this is an honoring on something the names that he presents today have come recent on from the monochromatic and they have been presented to us as we agreed name so i can 't comment on I was going to add to the same thing we them in college but just is it a sensitive issue that raised named up certain people that were no atonement and now they are going to affect their well if the board is very sensitive to the role that engineer 's of which these streets and end up in to be made with them to a and that was very much on on forefront of their mind as they were linking it in making this recommendation as a result we 've suggested that maybe and when we do the redevelopment that we can have a form of recognition of the whole history of to any room both recent and past with these known would however we present though we 're not sure the moment but certainly I was very much importance in once I might have clicked on tight that the Christmas were trying while i read it wasn 't so much the names resume at the time but was so right today I think that 's what what ground I think it wasn 't actually particularly name base that was the right to making sweets I think that 's back in these discussions but I would see luxury involved begin to make sure the discusses I expect community board but just to make the decision to make sure that something I can do I can go for me please with thus for points i went to make this is someone 's just raised that is my business side effect by this there we 're climbing night so I just for those people haven 't_''_510.86 been here in conversation there 's been a lot of discussion councils so past few days this morning the cycle we obviously we haven 't TT quantifying how much I think something the other issue is that some members of historical relationship with some of these straight lines voiced some concerns and must be consulted the last thing I won my point that is of well I 'm hearing from the discussions on there with my polish this morning as the relevant this council moving forward and maple decisions on these matters and so whether maybe some move towards further consultation I wouldn 't want anybody is that space for parking lot we just the these names stealth correctly and don 't have a problem with that with ninety percent of them or you know those things probably I 'd like a little bit more information on on the for like we talked about in here very but deep barely gives them in the top but no clearing but also the costing you know like um you know if we could have another workshop to actually find out what the exact costing as if we say oh I could go with those to get redone and then find out more consultation of the costings yours to any business and we are all us all councils involved and in others that he 'll come up with a different resolution to they it 's just that I feel as though I haven 't got enough information here just a stick she 's making clear bud can I ask of this council then for example we came up with figure higher than 14,000 21,000 as a costume to do these changes would that simply be the reason not to do the check _"

the present time David books is carrying out that role but you actor if Don looking after the organization as well as being on the board at the present time what we appreciate you with I think very much in that just data captured you they were so wristwatch idea which one your desk so thank you for coming on and sorry to heat your position off um well think of the opportunity to concede the details of the N will report to you today you are our our Thunder by a very very large majority the industry does contribute funding as well but certainly it 's only we might better help you love you once a night with Wiggins okay will do the mingle with it this slide please the destination great lake taupo in terms of its statement of intent really has three overarching objectives and they 've been very much narrowed down in terms of the board discussion and the first and foremost was to build a stroller tourism economy and that 's really the economic objective of the GLT the second component is about increasing stakeholder engagement and participation now this was set about 18 months ago in the very early stages of DT LT at that time we recognize the financial situation in and our goal is to increase the financial participation of of the industry as well as a relationship management part of the issues that we identified is very much around the eye sites they do consume quite a lot of money but they also provide a range of services I have two slides here because I thought this year 's really important to put chapo tourism in turn into her and her broader context so this is the national tourism really it 's a complicated story if you read the newspaper basically if you read the headline steps arrivals to New Zealand that up five point four percent this year which is a great figure but tell Post story in terms of international arrivals is quite a different picture and what I 've laid out here is jappos key markets are UK USA in June you see that all negative Australia was plus six point one percent so we are getting good arrivals from Australia and we need to keep in mind that last year in a neutral year according to the data around 133,000 world cup now that looks good on the surface we New York underneath that and say well how long do these people stay and so forth our total guest nights and commercial the year for international I mean slightly but it doesn 't quite relate to a plus five percent arriving further let 's sort of the international context if you look at the domestic tourism context again it 's a slightly interesting story total domestic spend is up but what makes that up and and this is a over a two-year period holidays relatively static visiting friends and relatives pretty much wait so what does that say for it is the we don 't get a lot of business travel so that does mean that a holidaymaker components not strong and when you look further at the data what you see is that Auckland is capturing a very large proportion of domestic market and all the other smaller areas are I was standing there a telephone heads to in the corner in terms of its commercial accommodation darkness September last year the previous five years that have been in decline and then it is it is picked up from there so we are maintaining the up their notes interestingly our international visitor numbers are picked up and just on the last line there you can see that that gives you some detail about which parts of it up well pretty much that hotels and motels doing okay last year but backpackers recently played in holiday parks the Sigma 's that suffered in terms of what DG lt 's been up to i just got into bit more key marketing campaigns this year done three domestic campaigns in some international marketing in partners with others by the tourism New Zealand meetings and so forth the 20 sites continue to operate we have revitalized those conventions and incentive area a bit later and the website is doing well with growth in terms of this up eighty percent in last year mr. dragging it is a explore central North Island Alliance which was the central North Island regional tourism organisations ran a trade show last year we do have a PR agency that operates and none in Australia and that 's been particularly effective in also New Zealand we 've done some of the branding work folder then on to the convention bureau and there 's a number of other he issues probably the most interesting when is the mobile website what we are observing is just enormous vibration from all websites mobile websites in terms of juice and its people are using your smartphone or the PR side is we 've had a really good coverage in quite a broad range of media and also in a result of Marcus lush having done the tongariro alpine crossing and treat the equivalent advertising values with some suspicions and my personal opinion that Germans they do generate some very big numbers very quickly we 'll be paying that much media for mills and travel trade business setting so that is vital there 's nothing like inviting people here who are influential to actually see and experience the product so it 's a critical component of the gfl teens word and a number of this has been done in partnership with tourism New Zealand it 's the most cost-effective way of running this rose _"

suspecting it 's got older he was running the EU l program like you well something with it so besides Downey this guy named a proposed so the state and a little bit confused here talking about the ETA

along well do we need three de lis no environment sdsd three that I understand they walk trimester too nervous for Leah this is a private moment it 's up to the developers decided by our house we decide what well well hang on a minute it 's all so lame it also belongs in the suspect side we 're going together concentration one of the public road runs aboard what 's what do you see what 's boxes need to be technically known as far as first one is concerned I think the reason this one is that if they want to number top of these along the road in they need council support for the name of the road if it 's just a private road beneath not going to many Street numbers on it you know you can just go from to ask your own places I go to want to see developers actually fighting way be as district it 's all about heavy machinery after year and windows and things of their life have asked they put those three app is really reason why we can 't be fightin way to keep your dish that I think how sweet it is quite lazy please 00 developers have submitted 394 careful consideration order of preference road 1 by the way go to my deck that way that equally I don 't work you feel like

asking sorry mr. you know because I meant for this and I can agree but I 've obviously got three year which the improvements have taught and what protocol so in a way they are saying that they do want to know when that they want yes bring a move for approval for counseling and that 's not too different resolution on perhaps being a bit absolutely we 're giving someone that you may invite and widely accepted oh that ignorant official so as much as we use guidance ourselves to choosing the right amount of its easier because of the to the night I want to be these guidelines of a chair that should try the road they can name it as a wish provided that meets the emergency post tool so it 's not a name of the street that generally in place in the district and another factor is too that if they want the number obvious on the extreme end here sign and a 10-11 just be kind of reassuring council decision I way to determine drive along with other 10 important reacts the probate is right and when 'd like you rate the house we 're at the dock you answer my question to do that easily god what they want the government attraction with private roads they don 't need to like they day they can 't I I

Lewis it 's another tender for her any road stewardship them so can you talk us through this one this has only just been tabled so I see once again amazing isn 't that that attenders come in from 253,000 to five hundred and forty five thousand ones double okay well engineered estimate we 're sitting at 350 6,000 I 'm glad he didn 't add any sense and the lowest timber price was 250 35 hundred and forty thousand and eight cents on headed on to the tender is also ability that have any other properties we put on the system will cope with the system or copious so that it has been designed for about 40 properties any more questions of clarification etc move counter Hickman on after I count dementia so just so Dennis extra cost would just be it this year quite work to those individual properties is what campaigns do I just have a question perhaps my best addressed mr. Louis but I and staff members how has it been going on dealing with the people concerned down there who services been what 11 yeah it 's good people good xmas second hey homina questions or ticketing and moving looting I 've gotta move on I 've got a second ball kicked a little question I was just going to ask mr. Lewis your worship if in a flow had got a record of doing work in Addis to specialize in supplying fresh oysters but they will be using laser humming both of interaction okay thank you screw okay so i have a mover over here come sit questions for dr. Williams the measure of dealing with each visit each aligner and it 's this concept of chance or as as as I 'm going to go from straightly like I 'm just not quite sure from the background modes the system that pose here for essentially sewer outlet at the house through new septic tank with pump station Allen to align the capsule world maintainer right solution exists among us yeah now that we 're one district it 's a district-wide st it 's a district-wide cost and it 's a district-wide placement watercraft our just forget it 's not user pays in that particular instance of that street okay be nothing further on that there is a suggested resolution and I 'm sure counsel startling will keep a good eye on in Oh Flo technologies new zealand limited as they haven 't worked for us before make sure that the job is done to the standard that we expect so could I please have or do we have a movie didn 't we we had cancer down out cancel the cap are all open favor all for the tutoring and amore refuge transfer stations and once again you can see there 's a little estimates and the tender spread from 564 to 891 thousands so mr. Lewis again and if aquestion council member are they the existing that on a risk involved in changing suppliers or three-year contract if my memory serves me right it 's rolled through you it goes out to tend every three years yes so the existing people did tend to again but when successful who I 've got a mover and counselor kipper and need to thicken the down here somewhere council Johnson they further questions all in favor aye carried into item number seven this is the agenda item it came from the tae tongariro community board up to council cancelled at that time did not create the counselor the district councils didn 't have enough information asked for a workshop we 've been down here to to Rainey had a workshop listen to people reasons for and reasons against and it 's now as was promised by us that it would be dealt with before Christmas and this is floor is you 're certain it 's been made and the only bit of additional information is provided on seven bar one were three additional streams have been identified and we received correspondence from the mirage secretary pavia bottom three or four days following the meeting and so there 's three other one else humor grammatical corrections that 's the only additional information I 've got from you or you pop but the rest is as was discussed at the other previous workshop so I 'll answer any questions to do with the report any question on report it 's Counsell Williams classic Christians against one 's resolutions if you just let me assure that that 's clear that 's clean her or defective person would that be a close on some edge comes muscle than the infinium patients that are agreed no but I guess I said to see me to make today but some guidance for us as to whether or not you want to be ceilings easily you can always make another reservation I just take Celtic Fishman can take it I just just fold there is are exclusive guilty kept up the ocean while we 're on the subject like all the resolutions are just write a query vital number four in that resolution terms of 20 states that council officers are requested to provide options for recognition of the people involved developers on the through 19 Township report back to the Lord in councils Dooley in 2013 I just want to flesh that out and make it more specific to cover the two streets that have really been contingent in all of this process and to change that really into council officers are requested to provide options for recognition of the people that is Gibson new anchor and others involved in the development of peering in townships and important factor is already comes only from 20 beauties talking to that just will you give some exactly you wish my hospital on the basis that those are the two streets that have been really in contention over this whole process can selectmen 's John there 's the advertising budget cover the communications oh yes counselor William can I also need to resolution straight to be mean are full with off and the inspiron is to a counselor it could be simplified I think if you just had council approved maximum and budget expenditure one word can solve the whole problem I feel Maximus that 's the test set of koi yes some we just VST issue comes up often at and at fifty percent for a government take it it 's quite important cancel those recognized only advice is your worship I wish to give notice that I intend to move the amended resolution speak with the number three the maximum word as well and your resolution number four does that does that resolution move I have a second a second ago another one sorry okay I 'll give it to counsel Henderson he 's touring a community board member so does anybody wish to speak against the motion I just would like to Rick put on record that I would vote against it only because I 've been contacted by a lot of people who have used words to me like being marginalized and things like that and I work down here from 71 to happiest time of my life down here with all the married people the Italians and everything else we had an absolute going down here and I worry going forward what 's going to happen to heckling park and oh and delaney park and whoohoo street in telford does that have to have ter put in front of it as well but I realize that it 's going to get voted on and that 's democracy so Council happen oh yes we ship I 'd like to give motion abstaining from voting but my reasons are but I feel that the particularly the two engineers that counselor Capra has mentioned in my resolution for I just feel that they should this be a firmer requirement of this council at this particular stage feel more comfortable about voting if there was options in front of us right now to make a decision on sooner than leaving until March because previously in those sort of resolutions March comes June June comes next year and nothing 's been done out so that 's why I 'm not stadium from both of your mission hmm we should all come to see us on to Reese mattresses thing to the motion or I could do that now which is appropriate yeah that 's fine and just nobody wants to speak against the motion is not a lot of point of speaking feel the motion so I just put it to the vote yeah you know who 's she going to kempler innocent so I 'll take his before the motion fit and you like you 've already reserved the last position yeah council Henson so just to clarify when i speak the second indicator which option of the fish see yeah yeah yeah ok so there 's been a lot of debate over this in the community and I think as a council one of the difficult things I 've found is that a lot of difficult things I 've found is that part of what we 've been asked to judge on as a council is historical merit or otherwise of particular members in the community in regards to this my personal view is that most of these changes i have no problem was i the right thing is but i 've also found a difficult that we 've been put in a position on some of these names on a couple of them of essentially deciding on something which I believes beyond our knowledge or skills to do so one of the issues that 's come up for me is how we celebrate and remember all parts of the history of the staff and I think as councillors that 's our role to do that not to judge I think we 've got some good options here to consider in front of us my view is that basically we should go ahead with us I think in an ideal world the cost should not fall on ratepayers button vendors in this case of will and I think we have to look at that practically on a cost benefit to the ratepayers in the long term and also in terms of building better relations with Turangi to cure so my view is that my favor option three you well they 're sorry I 'm look at that yeah be confused from them I love you the release of resolutions yes yes so what so so you 're the second do you 've moved this resolution here in Totem on page hidden bar X you 've taken up so I 'm not move to pierce yeah okay okay and did you review the different so just to clarify the option I favor as changing all this with the exception of the two names through em to speak and the further negotiations as happy Jocelyn oh you so give second of the whole thing you 've taken the whole thing give senators.htm bar sri ok let 's my mistake my apologies Spence my view anyway which is options will happen to the cash like you can withdraw your second if you want but yeah I would draw my second off okay but I 'll put it back again counselor kipper and move the resolution in totem page seven bars relisted 124 with the amendment in number three their counter approves a maximum and budget amount of 25 5 and that number for that council officers for recognition people counter Gibson Decker and others by March 2013 and is do it was dwarfed I do another second to flat motions just a word directives that Barry who cleans comment is the commitment from Council to celebrate a recognition that those names it 's a commitment they don 't concerned about well there 's no that 's why number four has changed to the repetition of people Gibson dick and others by March 2013 we put the work that 's the resolution it 's on the table yeah but you would do well no that 's what I support I said the offense for our supporters the only those first couple of heart and further discussion risks recognized here so you still taking this is there what 's up some of these names of the be further discussed like the Sun know just how to celebrate them they 're coming off they 're getting changed and these people are saying that they want another way of having those peoples tell about whether it 's a park and the more more of something something i don 't know that work and progress yes that 's fine but you 're shaking since fear the discussion goes on about celebrating my problem support by march two thousand get it that 's fine yeah and it 'll probably be a community board coming back to council again get the local people what they want for those gibson deck or less cocaine get it yeah right so you 're still the second that yes okay so i 'll put the motion or local divisions put on ya oh you 're so to speak so i want to speak to a fiercely in inside again also want to ask for a division yep just just to clarify please because I 'm abstaining from voting with i abstained from voting because what counselor Henderson is is employing is second this resolution and as I read this this resolution particularly item one changes those names of Gibson and Decker you without any further discussion am I correct yes and and that 's why I 'm abstaining although and no the writer that term for does refer to questions and some some sort of recognition for those two people and others but personally I would like to see decision and that 's why I prefer it to be deferred mannequin motorboat on it when those things come forward there 's been on such a lot of discussion on this item and a little bit disappointed that we 've not got some food recognition for those two people in front of us today Leadership Council hello I 'm vote comes a heckler I support you but having said that democracy is democracy we have a resolution here has a mover in a second that you know how to sister witness I most respect for how anybody votes you today that 's called a democracy and I have my reasons as well but we democracy wins the day and it 's on the floor and i 'll come back to once but that 'll be the end of it then i 'll be going to Gary kipper and he has called for division and we will have a division and your your your points are noted and I sincerely hope that that by March date does get me and all shouldn 't be writing writing it to make sure it counseling I 'd share some of those concerns and I have spoken with staff without going forward that that would have been better if we could of earlier in the piece get in place what we are going to do in terms of those notes but I think given the time frame that 's been a little unrealistic so I 'm comfortable with that and the other thing to recognize of course as we do have significant money about this pendant or any over the next couple of years and I 'm sure within that money and the space that will be worked on in terms that urban redevelopment something can be found in something will be and if it doesn 't then we 'll probably be back here having sort of discussion again well I hope you find something so final word from the mover in favor of the motion councillor cut thank you your worship I prepared for this moment that I want first to go back and then moving the best of the presentation I wish to cover my following points deed of settlement which is this body ache between the crowd and to Damien Sakura contains a number of things among which is the addressing of the changing for the street names within this document is the letter written by the then chairman of the tyranny community board tymberlee which simply invites to daily ticker it to the table to speak about these changes some of those and the document itself is not the letter itself but an interpretation of the letter and text form in the letter states the 290 Tongariro community board extends an invitation to 92 don 't occur to attend a meeting at my boards office to discuss names of various locations within our community the board acknowledges that today it 's occur and signaled in its treaty settlement negotiations with the crown a desire to have the names of certain streets and reserves and today need changed too naughty to dougie to coronate the issue of name changes should receive due consideration by both of us as we are all part of one community we feel that is important for our continuing relationship that we cut it together to listen to that we may both be happy with please indicate your response to this invitation and my staff will endeavor to set up a mutually acceptable date which may the five to the elections on the tenth of October 1998 involved in you to turn into two community board the this council has been accused of its tidiness and addressing the remaining issues and has been blamed if you like or lack of respect and for delaying the addressing of this issue since 1998 and 14 years a delay after 14 years has been blamed on this council I wish to address these issues in terms of what I know to ever happen yes you first came to the board in February this year that 's the sport idea recall that in august 2005 toilet place was changed to read their place in pod case was a new street concern created as a side street from agreement place to my knowledge that was the only time previously since i 've been involved in the board and council that any requests that come from to don 't need to cover to address members of our community such as lyric is mentioned and i wish to acknowledge their concerns the TT community board is simply trying to do the right thing but you don 't have to occur to correct an issue caused by the crown some 48 50 years ago to this extent i think we 're better prepared for addressing the changes and have so move the resolution to that respect I now wish to address the two streets that I think mostly of concerned in this process since februari they being Gibson street and decker drive I think the point to remember that going back to the takeover by the crown in the early 60s there were a number of issues tell her she was taken under the public we accept that was a different issue to the sewage or the pollens arthropods are and they 've gained a separate issue of where dexa where Decker and Gibson street is sitting on what was termed as the Industrial Estate now the important thing here is that the industrial there yes they will babe if we 're supposed to be taken website now what happened after that transpired was that the current position is that land is essentially still today need to cool and in terminal it has looked after by linens and there are urban apartments and sitting on the parts on that plant and most parts of the land have one alone is 27 B memorials what that essentially means is all that lends going back to two down lift occur in the future somewhere along the line and and that 's why I think by removing Goodson and Decker the more moralizing their name in some other way and it 's been discussed today that how are we going to do that we haven 't specifically stated and then that 's why I asked for the name gets you in deca to be specifically mentioned because as counsel Anderson has alluded to we have the revitalization second stage coming up and it may be that somewhere in and there we could memorialize the names by combining with project I therefore wish to move the motion then call for a division okay yep you 're quite right counselor pepper etc has been brought to this council to teach them at the last council meeting first of my knowledge or anybody other than a trained community boards knowledge around this table and I think we 've acted rather speedily because here we are one month later with workshops that and a decision of the battery mate so as cancer kept assembly will call for diversion and hands up all those people for the motion place so I 'm going to call that we okay on the sheet so council o keeper for guys Paul capsular crate okay so I 'm not sure four counts like into some counselor Williams one can slow down before councillor kept on counselor Johnson or counselor heckling okay s we ship them here again Oh motion is carried the resolution is carried thank you very much like there what up thanks John yeah we are bringing ah _"

during their process they explained what was going on the next space would be once we determine what we 're actually going to do what they will be going back out to everyone saying all this is what we propose it to this okay that 's good if I bought it again I 'll afforded as I power cuts back so notice add something the AC bars what was a topic of discussion between three of us among the three of us as we left was that the we didn 't have anything and I know we 're going backwards we didn 't have anything in the budget for doing anything about demolishing the thermal pools we had a look at than the night there you 're awful but the thing was there were the only two aspects of the whole complex that actually makes money quoted with seventy thousand dollars a year they married the other one was the tigress nice and I you from Beulah a of the manager she was quite upset that we were demolishing she said that they 've been my money so how many just quoting here are we well I think what Barry was before I 'm not really worth his mouth was that if the budget has got some fat in at the end or they don 't find that for what 's going as far down as they thought would we ever look we owe more to go well guess what I don 't want to be fair enough but I 'm just saying that I see a part of that just got a different I just want to say that I 'm walked on routing problem I don 't know either cindy has a daughter then when you jumped in the air for assuring this weekend will clarify it for you right go back that way you were before you want to repair the a bag or do you want to make them happen when i get decision n urltv yeah our only concern was really that it to require the pools write the to the bats during because that 's our story doesn 't fall I agree and we obviously nine

in it Supper is highly dependent on its domestic market in in neighbors for physics which to me is not sure yet if there 's no further questions always just so I was just on the young you know the rebranding Central Park people everybody need does to show how much we gain from the Australian market or whether it is decreased or increased well so there was a real good campaign was indeed changed you know because we won 't kind of agree that Central Park and friended us with in there as well if we get much out of it I think short answer would be no and the reason for that is you are getting two flights a week it 's around 6,000 seats as I understand about half of those of any weeds and even for the conventions and incentives business for what you would be perfect the timing is wrong because they come in on tuesday and fly out on the wind say whatever it is you can 't actually have a block convention for it 700,000 australian visitors to open the airport and possibly something like three or four thousand attractive rising visitors through the rotorua airport and therefore our biggest pipeline Australian visitors would be it 's really says that many people that oppose of course continue to 210 statement equal pavement with the 30 people that then came to the table and became the airline of twists and i would say constrain the airport growth by simply having flights and on tuesday the website that 's like that on the saturday and anybody normally going to australia for things like that list or anything like that 1a normally go I 'll 30 buddy come on a Monday Tuesday so that is that timetable as perhaps restricted that gross but I do have faith Driscoll 31 there 's a team of the voter airport for committee mystery cook they are working on moment trying to change the dates and open at melbourne won 't have melbourne and rivers so one can only hope and pray at Hope because it would would service especially 5px 0 times where we shoot you to a more ideal parking we can all jump across jasmine and visit our our maybe because in some thanks the presentation of a couple of questions and their colleague the easiest one starts I recognize you and a difficult operating environment that seriously take the eyes here was nine and I was having a look at them and the ps4 we met privately must with the average must intend to Annette is about 40pc so just and the other one was the most a separate question related to sounder operating expenditure is 266 thousand dollars the consultants implication please secure sockets a lot of cancer but us one thurs the majority of that is around website violence if I 'm neck is a whole brain in terms of design campaign collateral development and so forth but 22 first question yes I 'd agree we did the three-year statement of intent with some goals that n at a time prior to the European meltdown process so i think the prevailing thoughts of the time were that we were over the global financial crisis and we are on a trajectory of recovery and essentially that into at the time those gold pieces and obviously that operating environment is not tuned out so if we were to go do it again today we would probably be much more conservative about what we could expect my way out bro Christian 's about operating expenditure as well this sort of understaffed related expenses and then that all other expenses what I could expect about it the mostest category well the staff costs are all of the staff costs off both the I sites and the White House sir its staffing costs and I 'm sorry if we come back to you on another operating register one will excited about your new move at us but when do you expect to be installed the time of day event is the start of paper execute presentation I guess them an ongoing point has been that amount of as secret of your travel well is there any way to address that and I guess the other mothers the eyesight the website is a crime channel ocean distribution really connection particularly in the social media space I 'm in the process of a couple of areas in that segment of with contracts and so that I want to have a closer look at and also in Peru if I don 't achieve it while I 'm here it will certainly be on the agenda for the new GM to not very plus here so I 'm expecting either some of the activity to be bought in house or reconsideration of how we deliver some of our services you must acknowledge the others were any any company the size of the audience absolutely then again the GOP is one of the principal roles are marketing and therefore it is a variable and can and with regards to the I sites the other you need structural or realigning far as the more industry I think the ability to contribute more particularly into the eye sight sizes is somewhat limited we had some preliminary discussions about how we bundle our marketing package for operators including more eyesight presence but at this stage we do need to ever fundamental look at the I sites in a knot group we 're aware of monkey no situation we enterprise activity that 's down there and I know as we have fun for example provided some mock-ups in relation to grow signage and it also potentially caravans and marketing terms of addressing the seasonal nature and try to get more it 's fun thank you very much mr.

a council but in our background boy and we make the decision is going to cost somebody that may be ritually taken with inside there later date so we have a number associated today I think that 's big enough to give you input you know just point out of a nice council meetings in okay well my point of view is mere of resisting and having spoken to most of the counselors around the table I think it 's unfair to ask nine counselors who haven 't been involved in this process at all to make this decision here today I want to reimburse we are webcam and you can hear me in the back of the room i 'm sure this council is not going to share kawai or turn away from its responsibilities in this matter it 's not going to be just put in the cupboard be addressed more thoroughly look alive for one and I can hear to round the room for my fellow councillors I cannot give a conscious on a smokier today because we don 't know enough about it we want more information we have formulated a resolution here today which basically says that this maker will be workshop again headed by the too many hungry a community board during autonomy reversibility would will involve a logistic cancel counselors which are you ladies and gentlemen round table because you are district councillor we would be addressing the maker of all the issues including every name change as it comes up we will be interesting the issue of rune page and what it costs in a thorough manner including businesses that regressed to us having to change thermostat or whatever the issues of the time inspector pepper but this workshop 1k takes forthwith and a decision will be made forthwith and by forthwith i 'm using a time frame of one or two months perhaps we have to get together has been information that has come out suits the community board made its to go we 've got to do our job correctly and properly and i see there has been a most expedient way forward with this issue so ready I just like a crisp it does an open workshop you will into Super Tuscans I would be like the workshop most definitely we don 't ever behind closed doors and Leslie Newton would be an open workshop and I think we need to a very strong format people that may be unsupported and people that do we need to hear them equally a little bit like a submission process although not quite in that gift we will deliberate then we can make a fair and on a conscious decision especially the nine of us that have not been involved in this on its inception private community board so I 've written had written out a resolution here and I reiterate again this is not going to just go down the river on a boat it 's going to get dressed when we 're color that sorry that help our district council is committed to resolving this matter fourth word and confirms street names for certain streets and reserves and three be referred back to the board for further information and that the board hold a workshop for council and immediate families of those previously recognized in the street and reserve banks and Marty to Rainey took away on this matter division so if that is adopted each day that should mean that there will be a workshop in the very near future everything will be put on the table and then capital can make a decision and I would go so far to say I get a very very unhappy yes if that decision would not make this boat equipment I just asked to start I know they 'll be talking for you decision-making capital are costing apart from those four names it could be five years with all the rest of these can we do get a costume on those because if you agree just you know Tariq 's telling nation Main Street is all the council 's agree on it so you don 't need to cancel the innocent I just respond to counsel down I believe but suppose I 'll make very clear on behalf of the Capital District backpack I 'm not going to go down without a fight the central government central government had erred or made a mistake or whatever in the nineteen sixty happy to be part of a team put in right central government needs like cheese and no matter how big or small of us and we least we need to try we should not be going around at some central government 's problem with late payers money so that needs to be positive with that we will make proper care a lot more body that is generous amount of questions and we 'll do some more work for free now in the choppers and I just written but more the range of life understand I really I really don 't see any I would really hate to see this whole meter protected by an agile central government over the funding arguing over the impending birth the cost of us and it 's been like okay and this is a strong light but that we about converter for month which I 've I can 't see this proper seen in one two three and four that dick I 've had some posts my parent park the other the other changes are not that steep shoeless and before I own I would think I would hope that the costs would be quite small for those that we made a creamy to the effort all you wouldn 't like me to like to go move its after person to see if our funders will get back with no i don 't i don 't think that i think would watch it is cuts of donuts find out how what is the cost for these people need maker what are the possible costs and app and ramifications through that has and then make a decision based on that but I doubt that we should be challenging government or ever will but just a figurehead Australia but was 75 they open forward just a figure 2 to right wrongs that have been done in the city you don 't think we should at least attempt to give the other people are cool too long oh come farming area about the age the whole district and any food and on the right path no good thing that belong to somebody else I will try to put that through work along well I just can 't see that the cost of entry heck well we 're going to workshop it so you can 't see the trees I don 't know what the cost article to start is not produced up with those property when they do we can address it it 's 50 green on at least going to like to Treasury market if you have the money please but the right page shouldn 't have to pay 10 2012 in my opinion we may not get it but we 've gotta try it 's going to say I think we 're getting a bit sidetracked on the costing me because what and the effect we 're saying is we may not make these changes because it 's going to cost something when I 'm suggesting of a new suggested a resolution from the board 's recommendation there was a second part to it basically all of and Todd close so what I 'm suggesting is that we could simply adopt the other changes and you through these four changes for the workshop mentat material don 't you know look how we feel that the name something that doesn 't escort cost of businesses we need to know just just so we know our own conscience we realize that and you know I fully support via Rick asking the government force approaching towards us I mean to me it just freezes my conscience to make sure I 'm making the exact decision and not picking the parties at the paper I understand order I did one of the money

signage so I put an agenda item on which gives you a bit of background to this item but i 'm going to let kelvin most you know Calvin okay Calvin is a business owner on Hugh street on a wonderful new develop to ustream who kept up roached us about what I think is a really great idea just sat in front of you and I 've just that perhaps Calvin just talk you through it because he 's got a better handle which would which of your boobs kill them addiction addiction yak welcome rockland finger your worship new counselors and this idea initiated a little while bit when I go overseas or any big cities throughout the world you know you see you go to a place and you what you want to have around all see the city itself and a lot of places now with they of course if one 's a bit more active than they used to be and there 's always an allocated zone something in safe and run with everybody else in the community because then you go to places in some of the times you don 't know the areas you 're going to run or you know we should talk to you and you want to stay within a certain boundary and the other thing that I found running nose sort of courses that they actually take in the areas that you wouldn 't normally just put yourself into you know here is that of interest that you know just through sheer laziness or or just of not knowing that you stayed Greek within the center but this I hope also creates it sort of get some work out in the given structure of the town which puts them out the 40 walker and listen Peter sisters just for this trail alone itself but that 's what I bound we 're other bits and pieces of you go and issues keep this get to see a bigger area of the place you 're visiting this where that comes from and this is the start of a big picture I hope my items around the town and we 're an active community we always have a lot of events on a lot of people here so we can offer them you know it 's through a website with it then great like Chapo 's website or like typo or somebody like that they can all day utilize the structure which we 're going to set up so stage one is this like Lake Taupo trail it 's utilizing what they used to have mail from course of course at the moment but it 's a safe running zone for people to train they come here they can stay in two mile Bay they can access a point which is marked with oh they join the former old part full k part or five miles 5k part and they want to go in 15 case they run to the next market down and can come back and return trip they 've got some idea you know someone comes to town we can I run from I can go to the end of the fish you can go into team case if you want anyone put any more owners on the council for expenditure and bits and pieces the only part and I see that we do need help with of course is with your internal and officers to help me with permits or placements off and if there is any issues with landowners or yeah that 's although I sort of acquire and then of course just the maintenance program on these these items might server install but that 's yeah they thus Snickers themselves that I put on that model you got in here in front of you is on it 's a steel post it sticks yet twelve hundred millimeters 12 and Romelu meters off out of the ground it 's a steel post it 's a it will be in concrete it 's got a sticker outside platform which lasts up to four or five years so the revolving and cost of legal for five years which you can we approach we can reappropriation four years on that post because they 're putting money in towards the community of course and it 's also involves helps businesses get involved within back into something that they love you know that 's as you see this one here I 've already got two major sponsors which will cover the course of these ones which is Smith sport shoes which is very interested and they wanted to do something like this in the sales for a long time and addiction street gear view street also you know and it 's a patient from the business owners to put something back and this is where we can see it for the greater community really cool okay oh well it 's fantastic they look plain text to come just from my point of view just couple questions what they get a cost per per each one um now with them on the ground because it got the girls going to use your internal infrastructure but we can with the cost of a Vegas and meeting abyss appease about 300 plus GST per unit cheaper than clips yeah I wonder if the council council Council or supporter surely under our way finding budget we can produce the expertise that 's needed tips for landowners permits or happens first today is primarily do you approve the project keller williams and easy fix and Calvin thanks extra light I think it 's brilliant consider this may or may not be appropriate but as a solution but under the survey conducted over second summer budget cuts of Christ was very much speaking up there was a very good City shall you can come Trevor matchbox trucks go and that we look at and I don 't know how this would work feel confident with sinking area just just from an inertial consideration and bad code so that each rider or Walker besides the water I had a little card which on the end that 's like logic autonomy iono yes oh you 've got the is the media turn around please could you just cancel you put your iPhone honor and you get all the details I know this is a solid concept but yes but different external comms ebook were different outcome and the outcome is that that will help us to is a raging monster the useful but I 'm also next for instance of detection as some information was regards to how he to first quarter shoppers or what I 'm even be giving spot price yeah that could be a good idea to put into the melting pot counselor Henderson applicable first thing I 'm here great initiative and obviously a lot of times gone unheard of your own and I mention other people work about so you know you should be thanked for that because you know clearly got quite a significant community benefit of us to go ahead um a couple questions a lot of mr. how many of the mother is well on this trail here it is team 10 ya has de Lyons with that yeah just a couple quick questions clarified three hundred dollars to for a hole in Vegas I mean is that parents oh and that the whole and in the past everything yeah completed jobs really does not include an alert on it 's been put into and of course it 's just the initial in cost yep from the Hornet so what are you seeking from council

lot more trails that could be done on all around the district doesn 't it so yeah yes only the start of something it 's not exactly the type is that another trail it goes from spot you go down to hook a force you go back up beside down huka Lodge oh yes sir commander I 've just got three councils Council meets your counselor crate counts of downtown selected so Kelvin brilliant and once in a lot to support a bit like me wreck my concern obviously them to controls the advertising if the council sort of did it and if they come to us and you know you 'd rather have it in your basket just so we 've got an idea on that yes or ya ice take control of their marketing so ever yeah yeah okay okay and council quit Kelvin I think we all applaud the idea you can tell with the number homes that are up and the fact that we are walking and cycling destination just a couple of things I obviously the distance is that 19 where does that refer to on this one that he put it in a non half kmac which is the other side of the paddocks where you give them two at six you don 't mean y 'all_''_689.62 be changeable whatever the word is adaptable because the moment we 've got we 've been planning a long time for the new track to go all the way to five mile Bay yes in the moment is the fundings they 're planning czar Oh person it cover and it could not be enough might have been a straight line it 's going to wiggle all over the place aren 't there 's no medicine yeah listen degree the council criterion yeah what I 'm saying is that again the Kanda Kanda the numbers at the top be adapted to the any changes that we have in the realities yes it is yeah yeah yeah because you are aware of the fact that we 're growing all the time and yeah begging your control yeah we can always yeah but well no this is a fantastic idea kill come for dinner might be something smaller or not what I tow port row for pudding price uh yeah I 'll just yeah carry on with the theme of the bringing in the green button yeah the anything I was going to would be great length trailer yeah and yet it and then then if I try and changed from the trail to walk or run or bike at Pacific it takes away yet it makes a grievous of it there 's what 's called a trail so with a net Italian pulpo epic great but you just kept objects to mountain bike trails a group your own room mr. boat on the logo games legally yeah had this perhaps another business applied for or how do people get them the business on today officially opposition oh um yeah of course this has been the face one another and there was an because the force disc is quite gently one youth really in the big budget of things and it sold it really fast but the other next option i 'll hit that you obviously only gave Christ Kristen yourself yeah well uh yeah okay and I mentioned I just means that the crystal cell 11 post and he said we how much did you see well just take her you know I know it 's which nice a good democracy post yes no no this this one 's sort of closed for that but button future yet what we 'll do is we can ever ties point a point of interest and maybe break them down to a singularly position but then it also becomes people want to be on they say the full full came out because it 's the boat entrance into the lake you see and then they don 't want to take number five because it 's it 's in the middle of the bush than me you know but it becomes entire spoon you 're opposed or is to 410 with your and chris 's Smith shoes on olk in it yeah I 'll turn out in it yeah so I mean there 's no opportunity for other businesses and yay advantage of a lakefront which is a high-profile woolen in quite and finish they come to a hit clean they 've come with the ideal opportunity knocks yeah been there as long they are great like a speaker the opportunities been there as long as the Lions walkers bendy yeah sorry I think your jacksie i know i 'd love to see bengal more normal size i know but the official name is the great plague walkway yeah that 's the official name of the train from the yacht club 324 a walker point mmm it 's also man is a lines will to witches I excited you I noticed there 's a fair yet 10 meters of something anything about yeah you know it 's only any small thing but I know you 're coming on counter thinking about if there was another business in town wanted to do it has just been pointed out they could go and attack the trail that comes off and goes down to and across the bridge into blast hukka falls it all that could be done with this some all of this trip down this area 's got trailed you just open you know what you wish it all I 'm trying to inquire is because it isn 't years can I talk even if inferred I wouldn 't like to see all that because there 's a lot of cycleways and cook it could expand and other businesses to be able to go on other different oh yes if it definitely loaves if a lil yes we 're hoping to work with them organizations like the mountain bike trails and bits and pieces to get a uniform standard going around so we can all utilize as well the hopefully year will ever 100 of these things around town you know I mean and applause again except in I won 't like to see to give you the sole and Smith 's the sole ride of advertising right through all the tracks and that right over thanks yeah we 've-- yeah we 've-- liked we will go through the process and we can use to say can see the Talpiot to put it out there to make the initiative to you know and other internal businesses within the community you want to be involved okay yeah yeah I like that idea of involving town center towers you 've had to drink you 've had the vision and that should be rewarded I 've always wanted to reward people with passion and vision but as council heckling says betrayed by two forces yes um I mean for 300 Allah 's are a pretty good advertising medium for any sort of others please somebody is dancing so it would really be good that if it moves any further from here that it is controlled by someone like tells you to tell maybe it 's even attended or something i 'm not sure i count to hinton antenna you know i was just kind of one of the points of spoken before it 's great that we 've got the some smartphones gala thing that 's really good initiative but research will indicate that websites get traffic a lot because of he market and offline and one thing I think we do as a council very poorly often because it 's just forgotten my things to go it 's actually putting those web addresses out there because this is all about events and tourism right so part of a bit benefit we hope to kick was kick back the counselor at home especially considering we spend quarter million dollars on our destination marketing website is to use things like this the smartphone thing will work just people but if you give them address into their heads they do go visitor so I think you have to come write letters on a point I was going to make about it and the second thing is yeah I 'd love to see it happen other places and it would be unsuitable this type of thing for the river trail down here and I 'm quite heavy pay for this one here thank you Miss Teen sent the only thing that they the part of using the QR codes was a clutter yeah you can overdo a song and if too much information yeah and it was the easiest form that I would see that would you direct people to up to us so we can also have that type of district council won 't lead to the head as well you know Omega needs to be booked yeah yeah i mean this question of d put it on big enough so you can we see the distance what do you put on soon as you see when someone stops actual probably stop on the air force really um yeah councilman ship the move I 'll move the resolutions okay right oh except as we would typically get there look this resolution says that you guys be thanked in and we receive your presentation which we 've done and we do sincerely thank you the projects are the secret by the resolution says at the project the support of opponent design of the microwaves been approved by council officers now most senior council officer of the CEO mr. Williams had just pointed out under these great lake taupo it 's just a poor district council just put our way back to stl better so these guys are going to approve the final design we have a movie with councillor mixture over here to the suggested resolution as you 're a second to that counselor Johnson so you will understand what that resolution is saying basically you could see these pop up at any time after council staff have done the final approval okay also we 'll check this go to them just just occurring just the time not you said five years is I know it 's a great idea and it was your idea Kelvin you know with the sponsors you know because especially that one the lines warm as you know how many hundred I think that 's a great idea old people you know no realize or that 's how far it 's going to be to go for a walk and back but I 'm just you know I agree with councillor heckling that fat five years is a long time to a prime position you know would it be better to bring it down to two or three years so is the opportunity then through town center topol to put it out to tender for another business but I 'm enough to get the option which is trying to increase your you know I mean obviously we go gets you idea it gives the opportunity and you because all years is a long time for prime find peace I think you 'll find three years is a time because I think what you 're going to find it the industry is if i 'm not wrong they 're beating down on probably something like be hunted down with a saying yeah us a lot of sense because you get a new sponsor or you do it again yeah I guess refurbished at the same time what was it sorry killing this sorry yeah well yeah what was a time line did you give to your sponsors of yourself and the I was working on the UV before they start to break down or call fate you look horrible you don 't want them looking horrible was for years I still feel zone that 's probably a little too long yeah well that won 't take it it 's come to a lil more but gal to Henderson end up yes it gets an important point that 's been raised I mean I just suggest three would fit in with the counselors timing because each time expansion on this is considered we 'll have to come back to council work so you 're probably doing that in sort of three year cycles over to mention Tim 's re annual wouldn 't so that just my foot somehow needs defining of the tunnel of something like I 'm a great believer and we 've done this what we 've been elected members that we get the right people to do the right job why don 't we suggest a resolution that it should be three year period but why don 't we have this project over to town seems to happen yeah yeah does not really it 's outside of his own but they 're counting to tell retailers in the town centre taupo these two guys have got this one three years time maybe they tend to it back out but they 've got to denounce into taupo in that zone whatever thought I 'm just trying to find a way of keeping council out of it cuz we don 't think you could evolve with the sort of thing sometimes I don 't think through the chair we administered a lecture reserves this is a very similar issue to the leases on the lakeshore reserves because we allow individual businesses to these certain portions of our reserve and I think this is a similar type of issue I fact that staff could go away and consider a contractual arrangement with against these things near and then perhaps bring that contractual arrangement to you pre-order helpless ask you not careful that 's the men here sorry yonni Christian our golfers who 's got a home blood for depreciation purposes will we do more Ava not a weekend well we often have items that 's a business community well you know one st need you don 't want you again through the chair i think that 's movie yeah they get council take garnish it comes in once a place into the ground yes okay so that 's another thing lately and contractual arrangement don 't want the communication or the maintenance of it ownership must stay with who paid for it yep just in here rip three yourself then maybe changing the words that supported and the final design and contractual arrangement as approved by council offices somewhere a little bit take it out administered that 's fair enough i would suggest that we bring that back for your information prior to proceeding with in particular project and week shouldn 't be so that should be months away but we 'll need to do that it would be nice to see them number it is prior is pricey january feasible with this um to be honest though it 's sort of like the old like to get them in the ground before I seem very well Christmas so it is feasible but if we you have to come back to us mr. Welby yeah that 's another month loft Toutatis November meeting will add to the December me to the various immense will try fit another the later to get it approved but is that going to hold you up that 's a month away before we even give a clear spots that 's still feasible but yeah no telling why can 't it why can 't we get delegate council offices to fix the contractual arrangements we 're going to say it 's puckett similar to the advertising round own delaney park in the growing on Thea I 'm the Pioneers have to refurbish and do things and that 's exactly the same site what do you think issue so let 's let 's put this wing of movements here through the concept of the design that 's what we 're proving you go i tidy up the mountain box right episodes management yeah I 'll pretty love you that I was just going to suggest that maybe the draft contract could be circulated councils slightly never was finalized we are yet without a label now we improve it you know I think it stays with manager you guys have his management yes I am providing people I 've met at that please and then so that was a resolution I lost track to whom someone moved out of it and was taken by counter Johnson all those in favor I carried thank you very much chillin a big thank you very much from everybody you wish advance s just one quick if we go there 's each one change color like that black that orange peel on the waterfront yellow will stop you 're gonna use the mech form as you can see the pictures I 'll use your mac chrome colors yeah use mechelen colors on Luke would be green and then Omicron greens and then if you went down to RT t it would be in the blue just following water just just do this little ok so you thank you very much _"

thoughts are employees among a few ideas i think what we should do is give start today here a list of the people that we like to address us at that workshop it would be an open workshop but we will just have a lot of people moving on but to rescue counselors and community board members such as do any couple are some business people maybe families of whatever made some not that 's going to have an open floor but I think those important people must start by to come back on that bag get the costume could have been talked about without business rebranding and so your agreement with just happy that the stone which shop on bus only this one summer school sex the sub sign around the outside the school that I well I mean everybody else to make the moment we have worked according to very high or excess and school holidays ok when you need the special food on board I 'd really love to be need to visit was another fire you be able to protect me one but what about it will do some weed shop seafood any color very bored me but Gary and on the twenty-third we 've got virtual park what about tuesday the 16 x i mean i know you ain 't going now we 're going to do it even even if it would be pushed by one even if you gave the next area it 's all in one day we call the three choppers in during say nine a.m. they dropped 18 am through could we make a little bit longer than you think remember team to live there will be a decision engagement one strategy but the chewy nice treat one where we go from to get in the boys knuckles are the new ice on our appearance treatment due to the second need to do is leave it alone with Buckley that 's the Pyramid of teaching so community engagement strategy street name changes attacked right now we can we in which on both horrendous go on to that a tree with the bond tour and competent like they 're like yo Tommy win money money money as I 've a study their life but yet blowing it what I 'm asked his head no that some would move around the to mollify area oh ok ok so for the best shelter get trained to treat the tree going out one more time on the twenty-third you 've got a group of Uncle Mike and come back can we do the bus go along with that release release the Gregory link you doin up defense on those it 's no good yeah especially the whole value written ok I 'm going to suite that we 're going to sweep then back down into that 2023 okay nothing on the sea doo de the 16th treating but what after I got out of 23 people stood up for monitoring group yep really that if I 'm properly I don 't let the coat about it anything else alright this one this one a 95 year for you hit me meet support at x equal authority in future and some some jello leaf accounts all we 've kind of been languishing but as a sister Sophie Marty and I think she also suggested that we that maybe Keith and I get together with her and then we have a workshop and reforming it and i think i think what what the lung consulted on was what what did the kamati want but I 'll make sure ok very happy of those that they they want to leave some council because its assets fun and we 're just concerned that if you don 't reform a classy all that a lot of their information is worth an or mirror office and Cheryl was you know not real we 're to advise us then there 's no formal structure around it it 's sister subtly which is really help host and and cap functions of your changes that we like it back to Sister City absolutely no difference a twin sister city taking language just the city 's it language since the last election now we have substituted committee very very well all over the web to invite which chair right most people they will resign they all exited stage left no one thought the issue I was got many on the deck to counsel with the new way of running not factory right it 's not just America change where it went to international committee to match what we know the people reside on cassette of liquor ban trusts they 're waiting for a lead from Council and I 'd like we 'd like the opportunity to put some structure around it and and get it going what it really only would need to be half an hour I won 't think the workshop this is not this is not customized do i need this better sister cities week the international what I think that 's what we 're trying to find out it was almost as with eg LT stone that was it was officially called you relationships international relationships of tears came today it 's a no I 'm Derek white one road trip good anyway that 's what yep so my name is don 't book for sure alive because we get heaps and it was of schoolkids come over why do you here and we go now going like we can 't your direction from a committee committee it 's just but yeah they 're looking they 're looking for direction from us their previous members of the cisco something and people that are still very much unchanged supporting cheryl she goes to them before tue to go clean on rice that was a servo damn right it basically we allowed that just the city evacuation committee to three sort of not counsel more more those people at the coalface with later ease of paint a stranger for 24 people like that and they still get a twenty-five-thousand-dollar as one and we should be that 's it then not you why doesn 't sound like hansel _"

    "text": "excellent we now the registry is just an opportune time to ask mr. Brown to come forward with his partner mr. Monroe I 'd you know I turn up again so just before we start on this team that just to give you a little bit of overview on this some going back into the last rhenium we removed the rolling coverage from capara road on cash may straight you might remember with quite controversial at a time that was the rowing clubs face headquarters of teacher Duncan has been working tirelessly i might say trying to find a new place to relocate the rowing club because those skip things are quite long they 've had a lot of conversations would to like to the Yacht Club and over the harbor trying to build on top of the banker and things like that he has worked tirelessly for four or five years that I know of and this is his latest dream of which he shared with me a month or two ago and I completely share it with them and asked them to get before council as quick as deal it up to see it happen before election days next year and I 'm sure mr. Brown would as well so mr. boneyard introduce your guest mr. Monroe and I 'll hand over to you mr. Witt Thank You mirakian councillors biome times and brown and this is Hugh Munro and we are representing each our own club here today I will put a table a copy of our our plans and I 'd like to spin just five minutes or so then our way through the plans that are sitting brilliant meerut is taking over a little bit of a history and I have chosen not to yell on the history today most you probably be aware of it and we are going to focus on the future so if you could um I just talk through the proposal here to start off with we have a project summary tab aroma is seeking to lease land from the carpet district council to enable the club to build a boat storage and clubhouse facilities project will be lively self funded the facility will be packed design and kind of system land use and we found a complete as project in three stages one epi 's ition of the suitable and initial design and consents to formation of a steering committee to finalize plans and we envisage that steering committee will be represented by business leaders in topic and we 've had some very very good support to date on where we 're going with their and stage three once we finalize that will be construction as far as costing and development goes we will ask that he counseled to meet the cost of the required can sense the primary cost of stage 2 i 'm going to engineering reports and working drawings and we are confident that the stage 3 will attract sizable corporate sponsorship and we 've already worked with local suppliers engineers it 's all through the cost of network effectiveness of the approach of good looking we 're here so if you 'd like to split the page here and get an idea of what we envisage we have been working with the council for five years now to identify a suitable base from which to most appropriate location and this is with consultation with council we 've looked at a number of options over the years and being a little bit frustrating error ambitions however we 've chosen with Constitutional Council the site because of approximately to the offer in the Harbormaster the central location which encourage schools Rose the access to sheltered water and a be unobtrusive footprint that does not impede views in any way you 'll see here we 've done a design of what we think the the club would look like would put a footprint here of where we believe it will fit kind of true sofy you 'll notice it but a a platform that will sit exactly where fury road is as well which will add another nobody doing platform that the whole will it can enjoy and if we look over the page there I 'll give you a little bit of background of who we are and what we do that father Thea was taken three days ago and that is newly students your team getting out in the boat and you can see they having it going for a really good resurgence so establish back in the 1970s we 've been a two mile Bay initially in the mid-seventies added era tear tear more recently a 2 pi rho rho which we abandoned down five years ago because of concerns over safety of school rose we have a fleet of late model rowing scripts in essence tobin around eighteen thousand dollars in one year alone we rated fifty thousand dollars to purchase movies the success of the 2012 Olympics have created resume demand for row at a national level and we have kept hun president inquiry in recent months we 've got 20 verse 50 students from both colleges that was to be involved in Rome we 've got 20 actively training on water now and we 've got 38 or rubbers directly involved in fact and we strongly believe that with permanent facilities Rome from once again be a major sport and govern as far as the wider community is concerned we believe that 's really important we 've had representatives of Rome New Zealand enthused about having the martyrs we getta if you it 's a pretty awesome to watch another rates for to think of the town we 've agreed with the yacht club during development will take into account dear future plans as well so the land using optimized and discussion with included concept in 20 open days where your hand growing and other sports or sports a showcase we 've been very strong in from both colleges already as I say with their force for cruise up but really students are missing out at the moment because we can 't cope with the larger numbers from that are based our goal is to see chapo represented at the highest level the national international championships in the short end of possible and can accommodate a limited number of walker and kayaks and we have seized it suggested to both clubs that room we made available now we have a continued growth in the of the road level place pressure on storage in the long team this project designed to secure the future growing in Taupo but we also see it as a major step toward creating a single space for all their support and helping us create a real asset to our community well it 's a lovely presentation mr. brown every year Duncan so we 'll open up for questions from fellow councillors council mentioning campus of innocent councilman to PDF great stuff dang it just it 's my first question is is it are you doubling up at club rooms here would you be sharing a yacht the yachting Club rooms type style are you operating a new club rooms as well as storage what we 've got there is the the front of that building is storage and we specifically need a 21 meter long space to put down growing scripts on one wall we have got ablution facilities designed for downstairs and upstairs will be gymnasium he and some social facilities so there will be some doubling up but what we 're going to do is compliment what you 're doing or spoken to dean rope and and we will look at what the facilities out got and look at adding on so that that whole area here will be maximized as far as potential incident counselor approval in principle but our motor questions first one relates to unserviceable water power of sewer connections and if there 's any ideas and costs of the implications are there worth commenting on the stage and then the other one is own technical difficulties in terms the current status of the Lamb and whether the suitable for building does the suitability for building relate to chair technical issues or what 's the issue has been any engineering feasibility dollar bill in Cyprus it 's not far about the blade you know it 's whatever portion protections on any sort of akin to that Bank so we worked on it commercial the Asajj I guess Thanks couch or William do you think thank you very much your presentation I 'm just stabbed if it is ready and I know there 's a lot of address tomorrow I liked our community madam justice from our past experience human children of road don 't I want to want to be doing stacker but rivers griddle remembers did I have more useful life with these be scared of police with weather conditions now I 280 days if I can get these lights out on discuss the whole month another train so just really checking to make sure that you put some somewhere weird or one growers can train and the that 's a really good point in this may not be an absolute ideal point from Rome purely perspective there 's this room there early and we identified at the location bay Billy on further out of town that water is better however as far as an overall package goes for nutrients I 've been getting a community-based facility going having the centralized location really is paranoid getting school activity involved I 've found that that appearance will engage that they don 't have to travel to barge this isn 't working distance for training etc so you 've got to air 50 this plugin will allow kids to train when it 's but will have Dominus inside and take care of that when when when these row is actually developed a little bit further they will travel to train and so what you do here is an initiator the sport of rowing and over the last five years we 've had quite a number of open days and exactly this location a couple of these photos in here are taken from from the spot year and it gives an indication or bun of what we can do it so to answer your question not purchase dispose range but I deal to build the club for the community so a huge of trailers cooked out to air a TV or somewhere like that that 's why we have an inclement weather you just traveled around this gives a trailer and yes right there someone else killed em up yeah so it 's all in here obviously old senior come on full council lots of times why do some really relates to obviously there 's only so much population and so on sport nervously Romans got a huge you know momentum it moment after the Olympics very much as rugby did after rugby world cup and we look at the hockey tube hell that 's grown and obviously that 's been the German two different of other sports here we 've kind of creating another know I just wondered why you know there wasn 't something incorporated closer or partly your club so you actually become part of them to make it more solid and you know available for the future being both as to rather than having a super solicitor that 's a good point that there 's two aspects their first of all you 've got to designations of land here first of when you up man which you guys know the new your club is sitting on that butter cheese bar is less coast we did explore time building on top of the bunker the job is pretty short of storage space themselves so they have got plans will put the council some time ago but to extend that butter both but you see we 've taken that growth into account when we 're doing our plans but what we see here is we are future proofing zappos development and we believe we probably room for four other storage or other sheds for general watersports I think you know the discussions we had over the last three years indicated that counsel was yacht up there and say well that 's is absolutely meant as far as storage space goes and its future is not guaranteed at the stage either so by creating this facility here we really guarantee individual formulas porcelain superior I think it 's a base that we can break them I mean I think what happen is when the your phone design the bunker extension that will clearly take into account what we 're doing there and aesthetically you can whole thing is really looked the whole period is it is near yeah come to mention my question might not be for you jack is just does I 'm the Department of eternal our fears and to have a master have to do with us as well do you have to go through hoops it just excuse you can see the dividing line between to the right that is the boundary of the lead and on the right side of that is legal road apart from a little green area to like us on the base that 's been stopped pastor the smell is it so the area of sleep right at the moment we stopped in to resume and refer us to Lisa the access to that building would either be direct from fury road at the top level just look at all to the through from above in early may be coming down some stairs or vehicle exes would have to be across the department into the fees name yoga so they will need to be some involvement in fees and doc in order to get commissioning for access across the front of your affection area Katherine Jackson thank you but I think just worth that comes in i think just prepared you for the counselors should 've been floated past the Harbormaster and he 's quite in tune with me yeah just what we wanted to hear the partnerships are the colors a lot of work on into the Cyprian the Yacht Club whether it 's joined up and how far apart the cook of expansion harbormaster 's this is gone past a lot of people already has now let Detroit all spoke Yaya Walker kayaking honey butter Yoko there was two years of negotiating comes needs to be done just note the resolution seeking approval in principle and it might cost us five library to do some work on it so I 'll make the motion was emotional for that second or so council pected what we distinguish it before I put it to the motion because I totally support this and I actually couldn 't me push Duncan rehab but every time I see him I fav reveal if I 'm a willya coming banggood we 're going to get those done but also just like to note that Duncan 's been supported today by Hugh Munro on his right hand side there and if the CEO tells me is right you 're obviously in very good hands to build a club because your grandfather bought rugby to New Zealand great-great-great-grandmother oh yes a year you 're not on a great grandpa left over the lineage obviously if you 're going to help get the rowing club I 've built them down there I think it 's absolutely fantastic so well done and on speaking on behalf the rest of my counsels here and want to see this happen they do want to help you to get this to happen to keep moving a team and you have a move on a second to put the motions of the floor as a fat off just by dangerous despite Joseph Allison one question after we talk to the department conservation regarding access you know Chris really there 's not a problem there wouldn 't be a problem with with allowing access to this new building truly would carefully then we 're not gonna be changing anything that happened XP right now I appreciate know she 's part of your club as well I mean I appreciate that but you wouldn 't want to get that we want to go wrong with me no I yeah John I 'm just a mr. it so yeah and we 'll make sure that we are yes just just I 'd really like to think that you 'll be telling mr. couch davion that this council is very supportive and and wants to see this happen and pass them up in all those or flavors hi Carrie thank you like a really nice isn 't hey that 's because i just bought but I just shows you know people with at some point I go ladies a German defend your injection again please take a little cheeky bugger and you 're done are you getting up in the bar okay I 'm moving to agenda number and you know item number eight I think this is fairly mechanical I can 't see mrs. reg in the room here it 's just a purely renewing the license of Riverside Park which appears that we running very well the fish mover I 'll me yep moves willingly by councillor heckling seconded by Councillor John surmising favor right area which in n 19 is ok special put projects officer my goodness raleigh but this is about swiping down ladies please switch _"

but also as a counselor I don 't fit with necessarily touted for those events but but you 're quite right the lux levels from what we understand i will ends way way out of our budget so we 'll still do some training and we 'll go back to you or we can have an international soccer tonight yeah cuz they can play it in the day but for what if you could played you in the day of your we do Harrison so I 've got a question Cubs Henderson just two boys that they 're right um okay so you 're gonna rate you 're going to go through the whole yeah she 's gonna ask if there was anything particular point out and then move it but it 's Carly going I really just wanted to summarize that this and we brought a reports you initial when we want to commercial take the trees ouch demagogy permission for them to come down on the basis that money will be spent on replanting this is a little us and wanting to use the funds from the trees that they 've planted back in the 80s with the expectation but that money would go into the development of delaney park for training lights so this is why the book I think it took a little bit more history into the house and I said we were told the working party we 've told him we weren 't going to get much money out of the projected harvest of the forestry moment because it was so much damage true that stall but it was always being total sub unions Washington 's all the way through that even and when I was cheering the youngin Tony subcommittee in the past I am there any funds that were received out of their portion of the trees were to be put into an delaney park and upgrade in a mere Bush was of these lights and with the harvest scene or the forest there was more and they were really quite concerned with the amount of money that was projected in the first place on you know that they wouldn 't be they had but since the harvest is going to be there has been more money that 's been produced out of the harbor so that 's where they 've come aboard to say look out a voucher we 'd like to go ahead if we can with those light servants worthless items bill so i think we were a mover and council Henderson did you want to move that I second and come sit down I want to see my stuff there 's no further clarification needed it seems fairly mechanical to me and good for the community so that more who has a favor I carried whoa how the fossil watch come for rhythm extension of me to meet a pro bowling club just to give it over to a safe level one on the last try any others we put quite a considerable amount of money into the bottom cover by men like it was it doesn 't really leave the advantage I think it was a thousand or something yeah it supported a new after two green down in the bowling club at that particular time it view of the bowling club there is three bowling greens too long slide the lake fury road and one at the back of the museum when your previous predecessors agreed and I 'll take and remember to allocate that money in the long term planet that particular time or alien planet ever want to walk they were to give back that bowling green at the back so they 've now Elise is now due to be renewed and it excludes the green at the back so we can do whatever we want something else with it the lease was actually pretty huge years ago when we do it and at that time it excluded the green at the back so we 've got that back now yeah we 've got that pic now before you just say B haven 't had become people headed man John that being able to walk down to the boat harbour and all that choice and give us access well it 's still fenced oh i realize i 've got beans but we 've got it back hey we 've got a bit with him 'll go tried that happen when we get that money that happened last time we granted them a new lease in 2014 9 that 's right Josh what 's what we 're asking for what they 're asking for now is essentially an extension to the term of at least beyond the original expiring data to of things so that they have a bit of security to put some investment into upgrading their buildings yep and we 're proposing that the most pragmatic way of doing that in be to ferry the lease to include two parts of renewal that would extend the term by 12 years so we go for six years to 18 all together they 've already had three so it would be an additional 15 years in 15 years from now an additional 12 years for winter despise this one so I 've got three heads up so I 'll go on without you can someone please I 'm just when you introduce the back section and some izettle an adjacent museum I answer it 's this outside yes couch as I pointed out I forgot and we 've already got it down yeah we 've already got there yeah what I just want to ask you before I go to Cal today I council heckling is why don 't we just release up into my menu and because apparently they want to spend a whole lot of money on the club rooms down there the rest of the lease is fine that 's that 's relatively recent least we 're quite happy with all the terms and conditions and all we want to do is extended to ok cool I go down on a coach I give what was the windows a lease from me up the table tennis club because we renew here just so was it to join up with that boy yes and I don 't play yeah I mean you know that but I wasn 't wasn 't we did so the leases were kind of particular wasn 't it was directly opposite the time of the management we 're going to click the Tennis Club off but we had to go back and do a change to the management plan that time we may have seen that it belonged to but I can 't because and when you got a lead just like at the same time as the Tennis Club and then they doesn 't give when you got elected mogul elected we said we weren 't kicking anybody on and we change them we did that reserve management plan and that 's where the Tennis Club got a new lease and just still happen as well but maybe 15 years well coming from mr. chairman and said you know we 've done the same at the heckling person as we saw it they don 't make all those leases kind of like match up to the time that area line goes and I just that 's why I said if the tennis got 15 then why don 't we just do the same with a bowl well the pickle park all the same yeah well that allows is still make Tom you know structure mention if they 're happy with what they 've asked me personally I 'm happy because hey they could do the clubrooms up and at all good I think realistically we 're not going to be doing it 's 15 yes no there 'll be no international hotels gardening yeah council offices I can 't zactly yeah i just want is them to do so that we actually do maintain that bowling green because of that comment from actual bowling club that we 've given it back to the council but now they 're not maintaining it well we never intended to maintain its evolving oh no but which I 'm tension was to rip it out and to landscape and incorporated in your fist of the gardens but but that it 's going to require a favor of additional razon wonderful but I question is what what do we have to do to at least I don 't just know it or maintain it that 's it this effect caught it will look at that yeah that wasn 't a way that 's alive well I 'm well because there 's a bit of a hidden thing unless you 're actually in the bottom time you 're looking at it this exactly that I don 't mean to spend any money on it but just to yep ok well let society shows you have you look at that that account kid question if I just like smooth suggested resolution yep and no further questions comments second us cancel heckling or as a favor I move thank you yeah your gender item number 30 new license to trade on reserved you probably completes the messes additional include right it 's funny it 's probably here to start being very proactive the last couple months going at republic and asking an educational interest for reserves to sleep i said like something we did get a couple of bucks tee box must mr. right gotta call my open up to go for with a nice back yours might be Oscar he never got nice detail of the nine hole okay well obviously on a quickly into that lead people just want to operate a golf cart and sell some stuff on reserve this is one of the responses i got back from requesting expressions of interest for licenses to train on council reserves openings yeah and wants to keep going straight away is it involves tip-top and I think they 're wanting to know we do not pay me get some sign lodging done and I 'll soak and it 's hence the reason I look to the solution the other ones are going to be workshopping this week to talk about the bigger issue of commercial it to video mezuzah but this is one it didn 't seem to conflict with anything else mr. what he does found out to kinloch periodically but once a week or so and no brainer to know granite I loved one arch p.m. exactly out of it okay just move just murder you know I move one question i seed maneuver he was like there 's a wrestling move counselor dog i 'm seeking my counsel as follows yeah are there any silly vitals really have to worry about to be able to drive on the receive their why should you would have ordered your teacher that 's why I 'm asking councillor mission operation instant one where he was none yet moving very fast questioning the dad listen _"

by seeing stuff to move item 14 directly after boat have a late item we have an urgent later item to be added to the agenda as the last item to be considered in the confidential section those recommendations from the performance monitoring committee meeting held on the twenty-third of October 2012 I move that subject to section 46 a government official information and meetings at 1987 at this hour item be dealt with at this meeting as it was not available at the time of the Jindal was circulated in consideration the origin as a matter of urgency behind the decision without delay to know the council to meet deadlines analyzing decisions and receive information with agreed timeframes the item will become agenda item number 28 now the second others thanks counselor mr. all those in favor Louisa games area okay on to item number one we have a presentation from the etiquettes for the tongariro brother so like to welcome up Terry Brown Eric Watson am a crossbow sorry not resolve one last Joe Cosby my name patia and I 'm not the mayor of toh toh aisi so thank you very much for this opportunity presented today and the three gentleman on my right are also members committee members of the advocates of Tonga the area and I know you know two of the very well local scene and Gary here and has been coming here for 60 years he told me last night and has a holiday home to carry my petal holiday home here for most of the last 20 years but right now on them between homes what still come down here but it 's nothing that procedure that the purpose of today 's presentation is to invite you to participate with us and what we think is a very exciting initiative to look at funding a PhD study on the lake so we will get on to that in just a moment but thank you for the funding you 've already given us for something else we 've been involved in recent times mainly the development of stage one of the tongue video River Trail and unfortunately I was unable to get to the opening last Saturday my mother-in-law was having surgery at the very time that this opening was on so I was it was a good occasion is the cutting of the of the two by four people that presented as part of the opening including one of your counselors the chair of the local community board Gary kitna thank you for participating in there Gary and it 's stage one of the trial yourselves contributed about eighty thousand dollars for that so we 're very very grateful for their money and all there 's probably been twice that I now put them to make stage one a success so for the third new guide we leveraged out and got another two thirds and you 've seen this result now it 's quite ironic but today we 're here asking for the same proportion the only one-third for something that we think is even more significant than the river trail and we 've already got the other two-thirds and we believe that if this PhD can be funded then the result of that will be profound as intergenerational potentially so that 's the purpose of of today 's presentation the format is gary has been the key person that 's been with various people get the funding we 've already got together and to to put together a business case for for doing this work so what I 'd like to do now is to hand over to Gary now I 'm going to go over there and drivers presentation and Gary and I 'll sort of work between us and hopefully we 'll make it all happen this is the other son Wow just by way of introduction what we 're basically here to do today is to put the impact into the market on the narrow and the gbank is a great load cell phone the N certain applies to the mitochondria you used to be considered one of the best trout fishing rivers in the world but a reality now is that is a way way way off and miss me some good whose officers in the last couple of weeks but that 's the sort of interior bration and I asked me in there hydrocal just an era got nothing and and this be the case of most of the other people on the labels of food science that 's hope here this thing so we can that 's the purpose of it I 've already introduced ourselves and between us we 've got 160 years of fishing experience in this area so it 's all anecdotal evidence April and Dave Dudley was joining us today I 'm just going to you just coming in here okay so what do you say guys yeah just in time sick bay here today to support us a long run and help taking questions or to my ear so that all the powers given safe is like the allows for 15 minutes or form an hour and in the rest of the time is Gary right thanks tips to it mr. chairman and counselors thanks for the opportunity to make its presentation I 'm sure many of you is passionate as we are about about the fishery and the problems which we 've noted over recent times the purpose of our presentation is to try and improve the sports fishery and either directly or indirectly the economy of the Talpiot district because we feel that the economy has definitely suffered we 've got two thirds from to funding sources and we 're asking the top i district council to provide the remaining one you the two thirds is comprised of funding from the Faris entrusting lower Hudson Wellington and the and the other 36,000 is from from Department of Conservation which we delighted to have had the opportunity to have so to recap we 're asking the top a district council for one-third of the fun during the tote the total cost of the project is 108,000 for the PhD student to do a three year study and the so what we 're asking you folk is if the topic council can provide 36,000 say 18,000 over to two consecutive years or that amount of funding we could talk about how much per year but if that 's a problem as we say they 're the fishery is in deep trouble and none of us really know that why which is why we we want to do this study the interesting thing is that the fishing licenses and significant decline you know from a bit over 12,000 annual licenses six that 's dropped down to a little over nine thousand which is a twenty one percent drop in full season licenses and that represents something like a five million annual drop in the revenue to the local economy which is pretty serious situation either then on the table and all the like last night disabled if I had an N device associated with 10 not steer at least every night best idea that 's been two hundred dollars they just multiply interesting two decades ago in the early 90s the fishery was bad as a hundred million it 's pretty clear that you couldn 't value it at anything like that today so there 's an urgent need to restore the fishery again we don 't know how until we do a study we 've been searching for a way forward and we 've we believe we have really found a way there with the proposal to mount a PhD study by one of dr. a professor david hamilton students from the Waikato University i should say here we 've met with with the good professor and he 's very need to understand the root causes of the problem and the lake better we need to understand the food web and we 've got to try and assist in the interactions amongst the various nutrients that 's phytoplankton zooplankton is melting trout we need to equip our fishery managers to correct the present food web imbalances and from that we hope to be able to carry out the interventions expected which will be a combination of special breeding programs addition of nutrients and or removal of undesirable species or anything else that crops up as a result of the study yeah now professor Hamilton is one of the leading freshwater scientists in New Zealand he 's got a worldwide reputation as it says there he 's got 20 PhDs under his belt he 's got impeccable track record and supervising applied research and his track record and delivering a solution to the right lake rotoiti problem which was a potion problem as the results are there for everybody to see in that the fishery there 's has really come away of a recent times he 's competent that the tap it work as I said earlier on the budget for the student as 108,000 and as I 've already mentioned we 've had 36,000 from the parison trust 36,000 from the Department of Conservation and these existing pages are conditional naturally in securing the final 12 it because we can 't take money from people and as we can make it clear to them that the whole project is in place we 're asking new folk to match the other funders contributions it 's an investment as I 've already said of 18,000 and two consecutive years starting next year we 're having to start this project early next year now we 've got a good track record we believe in using in leveraging council funds as Stewart has already mentioned to you but we think this is our most significant project this decade because it 's got into generational implications for our children grandchildren I 'm particularly keen to see that my grandchildren enjoy the marvelous fishing like and recall of old earnest in this area thanks thank thank you ladies and gentlemen and we 'd be very happy to answer questions _"

    "text": "thank you very much leave your presentation and just for some uh me want to be assured that some that this investigation might say even before the decision to initiate a review into the management of fishery was undertaken we were already in discussion or the Internet 's because they came to us and see including the demise of fishery obvious and things you need to know about the fishery in order to better understand the operates that 's good straight away yes these are our research bodies in it off we 're not currently emotions so that the traffic train that chain that it was referred to is all about understanding there between phytoplankton zooplankton it 's not because trout utilize it it 's not them in terms of their 90 points and if you 'd like but must act so they 're critical to sustaining populations and we can 't even able to believe it work with other funding metal councilman sir yeah thanks gentlemen obviously it is a bit concerned just a my own thing that like so and doc might have more answers like other fisheries the licensing dropping is that unique to just a Tungri right so this some like total pushing district is ear suffered a as we can see quite a decline in license sales decline has also been suffered in terms of Easton fishing game where closest neighbors in terms of Rotorua Lakes but not to the same extent as this we know that in the really bad past the really bad years at 95 six week we suffered here because some anglers left the special really throwing that difficulty with this lake is that unfortunately I wanna clear if you like impede the roller it 's a really clean lake in fact it 's too clean that 's almost it 's almost II right that 's that it 's that sort of Lakers you know you can see a long way to the lake that 's because there are very few new pencil so we are we are backing there is as well as some unknowns in terms of the way things operate in terms of the lake system you know it 's might just just up look obviously i 'm river power for any funding if you go to private big business and the district or is it just basically been it more at the am trust live one of the things like that at the department through anyone has been to wire that there in terms of one of the litigation process and in we along to the human asked for the full sum we 're talking about here from their mitigation trust that trust the side of their but it wasn 't really their business to be funding the sort of reason thank you cancel them Kim followed up a lot last week in the Ministry of Science Foundation these did say available for research we 're complying all the criteria we assure them respond to that Stuart the respond as well well I guess I 'd you first of all I was introduced as mr. Watson I can tell you the Derek Watson and miracles in hand quite different bank balances I 'm the Wilson and Watson someone else is young of you by having clarified that that their brings me up a source of funds but with government changes and is no longer available to us so things happening in government are such that what was a source of funds isn 't there for us any longer got it did follow up on that counselor Henderson um I 've observed that in Rotorua there 's been a lot of research on and there 's been some significant changes made in a way they manage their fishery nutrient mixing the diversion wall and that 's another mother who stirs and it seems indicators been some significant economic benefits from that so my question is in terms of how we make decisions in this fishery do we have unless probably as much question to today this you know got being currently people a responsible scientific research do we have an adequate scientific basis how far away are we from having that and how does our science basis relate to exactly what the written without a motor room I mean how far behind the eight ball this is a mission there 's been ongoing research and like equality for example for a long time so we had some really 's always been missing is this link between quite a banker the key nutrients and smoked so far collected zooplankton and smell that 's the key like that no one has really study them to obviously unless you go back through the years to preview finest long long time ago yes we talked about that they really gotta be in the boot of the car right I 've got a lot of follow-on question as well which is that the terms of solving lead we 've got the fishery the OECD consider this to be a significant part as the other research indicated the distance this is definitely applies 364 right we need to understand this light system far better than we do anyway so courageous task what you said about the lake is too clean we 've got two opposing groups here once trying to make blue cleaner once you 've tried to say it 's got to be a bit dirty to commit to keep the fish becoming so this the idea of mr. professor Hamilton is to disprove or prove which is best to clean lake or you 're saying not really we already know and in terms of the road or a situation there 's more trout and I grow bigger no rule and it 's all to do with nutrients okay it 's no doubt data we need that we need to understand what you gently walk either link what nutrient level we need and the link between your friends and zooplankton and quite a tandem and smell we need to understand that better in order to actually make some interventions for the benefit of this world I 've actually thought about it actually has more imperative the decisions because I see clean up clean very good a foot isn 't couldn 't the fisheries already in a bad spot isn 't going to get them either who is that so but the boss once my apartment was clean and official going so we know that there is another sort to be there and that 's why we 've got two Pines your understanding is quite amazed on how semester it 's part of that discussion showed up obviously overseas it be some very clean 'd be even more pristine in heaven areas and we probably have so maybe it is just a an odd link it 's not a real link you know look at the Great Wave out in games only life surely he has that worldwide communication inside Jason bridnet to speak to do definitely a grateful day of the fishery scientists we had on our team at the moment as he also has international experience so he comes to us if this is what 's the chemical time yes I open we we think that by combining his experience with what dr. Hanlon physics and other researchers weekend we can actually find out what we need to know to have a sleepover indeed for them officially okay you just just dr. observation from Michael 's view you look back in the history normal photos that are hanging in or foot to different places including the council chamber a pre 1920s 30s 40s 50s dislike for them Petra pristine condition and ten-pounders and sit down maintainers network up Thunder than the Straits up I can 't buy in I 'm not Silas by fun listen to mitigate just just doesn 't make sense it doesn 't gel I mean that the lake shorty have got a little bit do ya I think it 's a very fifty made by God of human and farming but we didn 't ever mad crazy season 40 that was immaculate first thing it 's so left but it doesn 't wash that theory my dutiful son wherever advocate and coming here trying to find way to independently get a handle on the same official the Department responds to to your comment mr. Muir the department 's be one that is there in the 1920s and 30s the fish that found their way into the slake were busy gobbling up all the NATO push they were here and that 's why they were huge fish there was a huge food source but i suspicion upon by actually was reading and it 's very pure than me that 's the semantics Weiss not foreign to use because it was that was realized that crikey who 's trout having to virtually all the native fallen upon the lake and the mail on their they headed yet it 's not the mixing the waters and electrical a notorious for its a lack of food or declan there 's a lack of food but from our point of view that 's also linked back to nutrient levels and wait late June watch it because the lake so deep you 've actually the result so let 's all theory but again the good understanding sciences and watch if I could throw toppings and you 're quite right about the fact that the native fish that these big fish paid and they were getting the nutrients through the food supply the replacement fish for the Kawara was the smelt tarawera smelt about that long top o smelt are about that long the issue has been that the smelt in top o are of a different size for the probable reason n numbers the numbers in my time of fishing here have diminished significantly so why what 's happening to the smelt forget about the child what 's happening to the smelt where 's their food supply their food supply zooplankton Michelle when he the green stuff that the zooplankton feed on he says there 's plenty of there to feed the zooplankton so something 's happened to the zooplankton what 's happened because that 's what 's missing for the smelt and given that the smelt make up something like eighty ninety percent of a trout 's diet you 've got a problem it 's the zooplankton seems to be the issue that identified Kathleen I was just going to add something to that which people may not realize is that that 's a Miss like the smell proportionately how the latest on driver in there you 'll find the other resources councilman just a comment I just see it first in eighteen thousand dollar investment is very small investment on bar for ratepayers okay I 'm so sorry 2004 and I 'm going to a very small investment on behalf of ratepayers to look at the fishery is really at this address or any more questions from the counselors and if not them done I 'd like to think FC group coming along here in presenting and just so go be coming information be received and gather cuts for the form of arrow river representatives we think for their presentation with

Mahina tava district performance report from july-to-september which is first three months of this any Iranian now counselors you only received the accounts probably this morning or late yesterday 230 of timber the reason for the delay was that during the long term plan BOCES council got quite a better negative comment in the media etc and respect of the financial state of council to appease that problem we decided to go to Standard Poor 's do the international credit rating agency for governments corporates and suchlike and obtain a credit rating for the council we had to wait until you adopted the auditor annual report which you did at the last council meeting before we could finalize the credit rating with Standard Poor 's as you realize an organization of that nature who gives credit ratings to governments etc has a fairly strict criteria and that gives d category talpa District Council has been given a credit rating of double a minus which makes it the only district council in New Zealand to achieve a double A rating the council 's that do have ratings in New Zealand mainly city and regional councils but for example taronga is a plus which is rating below to alpha district council one is hopeful that by using an international agency of this nature it will add some confidence to the ratepayers of the district as to the financial stability the financial strategy that 's being applied to counts by counsel and also that basically this councils in good hands so hints that delay in producing the September accounts because our focus has been very much on meeting the demands of the international credit agency I just want to add to that since this process was a quite a long laborious process I was involved in it myself I think my meeting was about three hours they put a lot of hard work into producing everything that was needed to get this result they went through everything with a fine-tooth comb credit rating as a fantastic result and as must 've been in and said we are the only small district council in New Zealand to achieve anything like it and I think it should be applauded and the center staff should be thanked then congratulated congratulated because yes a lot of negative press unnecessarily you can 't you can 't go past Standard Poor 's credit rating double a minus so well done on behalf of council must have been here and please share that with your staff about your all departments you Marvis result I think this is a celebration we didn 't actually have one source of celebration and seemingly yeah just like to congratulate that 's quite not stand alone all the restructuring changes taking place ok maybe you 're just forget it counselor penis and I 'll just just finish off what I saying the folks are trying to speak to their one of very complimentary or stuff that I also like to point out congratulations to all elected members because you are the ones at the end of that have signed off the annual plan council so remiss of me before to be putting all the kudos on you mr. Mahina but it is a very very well done and I tech to see mr. Watson that would at least be reported to the daily fight at the Dom PO I realize it 's not bad page one I won 't accept like it doesn 't get there fast make her better stop just stole my thunder i 'm sorry i was gonna when I lost the WIC staff are done and say that 's great and say you guys think we have I 'm had to endure a lot of public criticism about that she 's related to this is press are here today and would be hopeful that we can see some possible news reporting out of this manner and you own the other thing I 'd like to say just in closing mr. Watson if you could leave you after four hour yes what actually happens is that just was embargoed until this particular meeting Standard Poor 's will now be given permission to make it public we have come up with future borrowing we should be able to access funds through the ldf a and issue even by assuring arrange benches at 20 basis points which is point2 of a percent cheaper than we would have that we didn 't have a credit rating paid so if you think about the size of the loan book you know that 's two hundred thousand dollars on one hundred million dollars of borrowing don 't know big party okay we won 't be there hunched over so I can spend at my second husband ever at least each miles okay say well we tried to carry on through the rest of your bum at the end or item number 17 or your bro factorial you will finish this agenda item and what I was just going to mention the fact that we are looking to to change the format of this report and so we 've been working toward that and and hopefully next month and we 'll have a much more joined-up report for you and which includes both the performance and the financials through much more inland through here and plus just a just a no further look out for the new book November approach so team do you want to have a quick 10 minute break now and then we 'll finish this off to this place okay if we could just stick to 10 minutes would be great twenty past please thank you my religion and reconvene at 220 please r320 please _"

    "text": "moving to number thirteen and team economic development services grant and you wish to report on the front simply to say that you put your paid them the report from enterprise great lake taupo this is one of their contract requirements they are required to report quarterly that 's been tabled to it today along with a copy of proposed contract and just a couple of points first of all we don 't normally you approve the the the amount of funding for economic development through the annual plan process so it 's kind of unusual we 've brought the the contract back to you but I think that since you 've had quite a focus on we want to go in the future in terms of economic development was important you actually saw what was what was in the in the in the contract and the second thing is that I think that as you 've seen from your presentations from eg or tea that they 've had they were experiencing some difficulties 12 months ago they 've really made some big changes to the way that they actually their performance to date and under the new regime and and also on there in the contract that we would hear and so basically just resolution is that you for you to receive the the annual report and that I know that the edl T did actually make a request for additional funding from you and our suggestion is that and we talked to ed ed aunty about this is a book we the best place to do that is through the long-term plan when you decide how big you actually want to move in this area and but to give them some comfort and is to look at an 18-month contract rather than a 12 which would take them through to jun 2012 and that would then be this the beginning of your your own ltp from from then on is the sticking point tonight there too is that you actually have two lots of money for economic development one as the the grant that you provide to each elt and the other was a 50,000 was a year for economic development projects and that 's quite a specific apply for them which is party you 're all handed out to superstar I think this would make really really good interesting reading it 's the economic action review 2010 so it goes with that agenda item or worthy of a red any discussion councilman sir in so that 225,000 is that for their ongoing running costs that 's what that 's to citizen 150 thousand year and because you 're looking at 18 months so I 've I got it right that initially it was only 50,000 for a period of 12 months for projects we 're increasing that to a hundred thousand over that 18-month period if I could explain that and you set aside for two thousand dollars a year we haven 't tapped into that money yet so in fact it for this financial year is still the full 50,000 available and then there 's 50,000 oh ok so next year so they they should ok ok different so you we roll in the 50,000 over to next year on that so the exes II met fans that they come to us for some special needs they do come and talk to me about it now generally if you 're looking at about say ten thousand dollars worth that that would be something that we were just doing through delegation if it was something that we it was kind of them which was bigger and more significant and Nate than with probably would be coming back into Council for this is just giving them a budget to use during the year as they but acknowledging the direction of this place to be so then they might come back with something which is 50,000 with that 's also looking for additional funding that would certainly be bringing back here negatory so that means that there 's no impact on me and I just I just wanted to speak in support of it in the context of considering that we 're giving 1.8 million dollars to destination Lake Taupo it seems the funding by comparison seems quite small to me and over the next 18 months if we were not to support this I would think that empat us would be lost subsequent to getting more money later to catch up from not spending the money up from now so that 's just my thoughts on earth that I 'm fully supportive of it especially now that I know who the borders in a more in particular who 's be hitting it that one foot tall so I 'm very keen on that he has no steam taken out of hers so moved cancer down add taking a counselor Williams all those in favor all right you okay long term how long will just want to take into it right now against want to know is when i try to do in here that 's why i 'm asking you so you 're so keen to get over it exactly long-term capital community draft amendment if we can get this through shortly we 'll just do this one we have a quick come water I a cup of coffee or something and get back into it so I think what M was saying before that we grow the resolution on page 14 by one as a resolution that must go Burt and mr McLeod would like us to handed out now which which is and you could read it so I don 't need to read it out to you so right any questions I let 's take it as read and any questions on this it 's been workshop done what have you about the soup some what have you so I counted on it sweet decision okay food counter dollars taking a council inappropriate the boat I 'll ask begin if anybody wants any clarification or anything on it it 's pretty self-explanatory with the workshop the SERPs which we 've talked about individuals and how that and it 's also this also says that the degree careful here is to agrees to adopt for consultation and I emphasize weed consultation the proposed long-term council plan amendments for one rating area using the annual plan 2011-2012 consultation process move for counter downer and thinking what Counsell Williams all those in favor _"

Bowden and you ask mr. Bowden for it and if you think does anything need to be brought to our attention dislike so moving on your history an upgrade now that 's almost competitor couple remedial work but I want to say and I 'm quite happy to stay here and have it recorded and pretty sure that when we allocated the amount of money to do the street we were united and doing it we did get a but I must say to go down there now is just in fact I said it on the radio more on monday morning my radio show I challenge anybody anywhere New Zealand tell me of a nicer street plus it is absolutely wonderful i just wish we could do the whole town like it however we 've done that and i think you should be proud of it and i congratulate the people that worked on it and as i said on the radio i challenge anyone to tell me real nice to street New Zealanders anything fares on that big nothing tougher water treatment plant upgrade do it does William O if you just people to date I mean I know we 've got a contract on it but just look up to date as to how we are with regards to but it 's spinach from and map there 's any little thing that we should be for any men 's that should be brought to our attention regard to the proteins which Bridget refer to have water too so is there anything mr. ping to attention because than what 's listed on base anybody yeah so I was King Lear to receive some financials on that time discussing we must win with a keeper I mr. Weaver told me staff i prepared net net was one of those questions you gave to me i gave to mr. Williams I hate got slap replying to all those three questions you gave me I think it was that BMG me to wait yeah okay a week ago so better d but it is working progress me up think this coming shuttin and I did relay the kitchen on and we thank you and at this stage there 's nothing happening that it hasn 't been planned to heaven no unexpected journey wastewater treatment process improvements counselor yeah and we getting this tire fixed up a lot in terms of when it was built interesting to was the major upgrade we thought it was the state-of-the-art plant and now we see this that 's membranes which are causing trouble a few years ago still causing trouble now and then I heard on the radio reports about it that we were much and cubic meters of nitrogen coming out of our plans into the tower race well I understanding will be first that this is the amount of nitrogen coming out of the pods at the time was equivalent to a pound of bars I compared to a tractor-trailer unit of nitrogen coming from above BL governmental Lewis has jumped in the hot seat tell you all about it once in state-of-the-art plant in 2006 whenever it was commissioned what we found since then is that the combination of the element and callum dosing that we 're doing and silica that 's present and the water is clogging up the membranes now that wasn 't evident during the design phase so that 's what we 're trying to end there is a typical way of cleaning the membranes and that cleaning is not getting rid of all of that combination of silica and LMK if you didn 't have those two and the concentrations that you have you wouldn 't be having the problem so what we 're trying to do now is to work out how you can actually clean get about twenty percent clean whereas you should be getting about a ninety percent clean so what we will this process is to try and figure out how to get that mighty the scene clean now it means that the hydraulic efficiency of the plant increases so that 's really what this improvement project yeah buddy what we think physically comes innocent um could you just go into a little bit more in detail what the applications that are in terms of the operational facility in terms of costs efficiencies that sort of it in terms of operational efficiency once weekend is give the client cleaning that properly then the plant will operate more efficiently require less LM dosing so the operational costs will reduce and the hydraulic efficiency of the plant will be increased what it will mean is and there is she 'll be kept ex need to be spent which is already identified in the long-term plan for this to enable that washing to take place so we 'll need to build an additional structure to enable that Washington take place with essentially what 's going to membranes so we takin some me Raines out of the plant cleaning them and then putting and swapping them over so that the plant continues operating at its lesson my question is specifically I guess is can a dollar figure be put on what it 's costing us in terms of operational extra costs given that it 's not functioning to the cell efficiency in life not at the stage it 's more a question of the hydraulic capacity rather than significant additional costs what it really means is that if for instance there was growth in the town and you wanted an extra 250 connections or 300 connections at the moment we not might not be able to accommodate that because the whole hydraulic efficiency is impacted so the cost really relates to the chemical we 've been putting out by Dyson here don 't know yet yep having to use more of it okay anything physical map ok moving out back here and moving now to see XD ms pretty self explanatory or you want to add to that this blue aerotek erode should be finished by the states it and it looks pretty good for the next week and we should be in a position once that 's finished see how much of we 're at a row we 're able to do and whether there 's an economic pleased that we can do will be in the medbox rights cover data I just wondered because we 're at a road as a DD in Rome it isn 't it these are those what does it link up to you fondateur yep thank you okay now being a mad bike us that you add you are jealous we will get mom with ye be road widening I believe this funding they 're not to do the whole lot but you 're working with the cycle people did you do something like passing leaves or something there 's 300,000 in the budget for the widening spread over two years this year and 13 14 we 've been working with the cycling club to try and identify where we can get the biggest bang bang for our banks and identifying discrete locations between state highway one in Prague matar been identified with the cycling club we might not be able to achieve then something will be going back and trying to prioritize what we have identified we can do those that are causing the most consumer and the 300,000 we 've got 225 55 mins ETA jebel 5353 subsidized okay then can we go back earlier why for more and keep working on that road or if we must have given it for me like now is that door closed that doors closed for the next three years and three of top and go back at once or more yes that we have you go you all right and the last one the listing we 're getting outta quit difficult or heavy ah well it 's a little bit off topic that just I 'm just continued because quite hard with cycling unfeeling us about Nancy Clark and I 'm had a spot future let us hope that we 'll be able to when we get a new pair stage once and money from somewhere else income also keen free needles doesn 't wisdom of cycling Bingley image forgets to make a town center cycle friendly and I have been to these conferences urban design and all that so I think it 's just simply reduced to speed up with the 15 koalas a nap dr. speed bike dude that 's a speed cars we like to do you 'll mix and mingle together another language your

and full team but we 'll move now to agenda item number 18 so comes a good move together Johnson check number all those in favor by Carrie DT LT final statement of them tears we have anybody from here but a while the Shepherd 's your mother could be arrested we just um basically when you the the statement of intent that DDOT delivered to you as a draft was not the same statement of intent that they go to as a final there was some and there were some intent and so this simply corrects that and she now had the same statement of intent that you received Ezra now anybody got an equation clarification will commence forties anything regards okay being none there is a solution resolution 19 by one that the final is explaining boy but 2014 this makes a great lake taupo a second and think

of them this year to put my name forward by volunteer for we need for counselors come to the crate when he would learn I was I was asked to be to do the youth awards to but make it absolutely impartial and Kirsty asked me to look after the four different categories and share each one of them because they were complaints before that there were certain counselors were on it that belonged in

go down yes I just clarified before you try to put five before could I just make a comment in terms of the other ways also one of the criteria that was reviewed as a result of feedback from the previous year 's was about impartiality in terms of counselors who have students involved in the schools so that was why council McCreight was asked to to take parts so going forward it would be quite good at possible to have counselors who didn 't have any children at the schools yeah or they make a copy to do but we 've also gone skelter hisses that would like to do something but milestone aside to rock what can say you do toward you yes so crate and Henderson for youth awards that right yes thank you so you just survive my hair sorry mr. chairman even should I should I stand down from the

experts said is that if we want to save accidents we can 't save it by giving out all this advertising and all this education the only things we can change our skills like speed limits you can change license and age we 've got the highest weight in the world where the teenagers getting killed and licenses sold out sort of correspondence and that road engineering in our in our country is way behind anywhere else and to give an example that I 've got wrp wire won 't barriers saved a hundred lives in New South Wales in the last year and they are the ones where you hit them like up Wellington 's got them you hit the barrier instead of the car flipping like they went over the concrete barriers they 've got on point B road and those little ones they 've got well bully point the cars had them eating grass video of this three identical model cars hitting one of those concrete walls and the car just flipped and the whole thing smashed that everyone did not kill 100 k hit in the barriers like the one for every joint and the cars once again flipped over and smashed that route smashed in why wont very is slightly the same and it gives hit it and slit on the side and the car didn 't flip and that 's been proved all over the world we haven 't got one workshops and there the council meetings but my apologies are the trial I was double booked for the motor small part so the DuBose 's bodies why our house ATM of cust meeting in the funding innovation around and the quarterly meeting with lens and firing to aspire I 'm just the usual thing for me my diaries for the government 's manager

board will re address this at its next meeting on the top of April I think just to clarify there has been a misunderstanding and pastor a NIAMS and past years of committees and committee members and it was thought that the corridor counselors on the community board that they couldn 't be involved in the of the making or the building of submissions to come to counter on impact we that is an incorrect and you can both you calculate counselor Henderson can be involved in working with your community board to make submissions to the annual plan process so they saw what time to do that in there because so but so just to clarify there we were originally told that we couldn 't participate in their process but we can yeah okay then historically it 's been wrong that its name people but I was also under that impression I 've been to council committee board meetings where we have left the room because a submission was being made to counter and we thought yourself but an actual fact you can 't omit to yourself so we were wrong hands up and Gary got it wrong and his predecessor got it wrong but the facts are you came I might just found out you worship I was actually going to challenge it since i 'm sitting in the chair this time but i don 't need to well there you go so anyway nobody 's perfect but you can be part of the building of the submission and listen to this dimension it 's kept in just a couple of points I was going to challenge it also because i wasn 't able to find any reference to that but i 'm glad that it 's changed secondly in relation to these minutes i do have

Plainfield 's particularly for cricket particularly for cricket and the cricket season will only just be starting would have some concerns regarding the possible damage to that playing field was hoped that we 'd get enough money people get a brand-new cricket pitch out of it oh my god i thought the one of the suggestions earlier in the piece was the primary school ground playing field so i would certainly support that well primary school we don 't actually have any control over but the pta or parent Teachers Association already they call them of the school is considering doing campervan parking and we can 't weekend which certainly it 's important but we can 't stop them but I know they ask for you I don 't know that the back you made a decision to the down add are very keen to have that fenced end user for what 's the process for their van is that a council decision your worship certainly there 's a she a little more work to be done here I mean it was simply a suggestion that was was put forward at the meeting and as I understand it mr. it 'll be talking tomorrow about and the whole the whole issue of of how we might deal with them I think probably there was actually

Williams are we still looking for a new AC buzz and advocate or Oh possibly yeah yes an electric motor that 's came to act as a key point of liaison between Andrew the project manager and the rest of the elected team then what Andrew Bowden has been sort of saying if he had one council that he could work with and even could even be on a two daily basis or something like that just he and then that person coming keep all these fellow councillors in the loop of what 's going on up there a lot of money going to that we get it right because it didn 't necessarily get it right last on but I 'm not blaming counselors for that but the more prudent we are and the more expeditious we are in watching and looking and making sure that the jobs been doing right a better result we will get in the end of the day I believe that 's a bit like being talked about in here before project management yes we have got a project manager managing this project but his management is not governance so the opportunity is there for someone from governance to work with that manager mb the advocate and Cyprien opportunities approach to talk about this next week when there 's a workshop I can 't believe that tightly i see birds and that might give you a flavor of what 's happening and absolutely the interest rate under issue interested in okay well we 'll put those are a need one or two counselors just a zoo but one would probably be enough we Andrew can bring them as well have come up and have a look at those to just come back to us and say hey we better have a look at this or this one kept me just give everybody time to smell the flowers so we 'll address that with shop next week so idiot any anybody want to add anything or towing company but oh it 's just that we find in workshop mr. green has promised up there and be within two weeks and apparently it with your three as soon as possible I get this right and we previously surprised according to mr. green well this how we 're going to get on in pain and will will Easter sitting in three weeks time absolutely no well one will work with you mr.

    "text": "you mind taking a question as we go through Scott I mr. Pearson sorry I 'm not counselor Truman I was just wondering am so how many visitors at the same dish but Jesus actual visitors to the site yep we would get just telling you in sort of bulb terms since august two thousand ten you had one hundred and twenty-six thousand visitors to the site I 'll just run through a little bit more detail in a moment as we go through those performance results we tend to sort of set around that sixteen to eighteen thousand unique visitors it does vary from month to month Marion mind there are two eyesight 's hotel I 'm just talking about the web traffic at the moment sir just to err is it with it we 're here just one thing to keep in mind when we go through these stats and especially talking about the commercial accommodation stats so interesting to know that there 's a domestic visitor monitor which basically surveys domestic travel patterns throughout the country and what that 's showing is that tow port in the front of Wellington before the leisure traveler so it 's important when you think about commercial accommodation stats they include business travelers they include visiting friends and relatives and they include the leisure traveler so one of the things that we 're particularly looking at is how we grow that leisure market and potentially how we go the leisured market versus the events market so there 's a couple of things in our research that we need to look really closely at and say you 'll hear more about that as we go through the year and the research work we 're going to be done a bunch of redemption conferencing obviously conference they just usually hire new zealand like this policy without a bit the numbers of compasses have dropped away is that that 's for bringing we do have the Cody extents we haven 't got them in this document but I can certainly make them available to you as far as I 'm aware our conferencing stance is still relatively high we get about ten percent of the new zealand 's and it 's and my sister conferences association meetings and special occasions like weddings and things our events tend to be slightly smaller because of the size of our facilities but yeah whisper as far as I 'm concerned we 're still doing relatively well there but I 'll get better suited to show so what I put up here is a list of the key achievements since we started in July last year now I 'll just get you to run through I won 't read through these individually but that you have a look through those now and that will give you an idea of the sorts of things that we 've been involved with the domestic marketing campaign has been a huge one for I think this region and for the organization and sensitive building up the the money at what I would call the thin end of the wedge that really makes the difference and having going from a twenty-thousand-dollar domestic marketing budget up to a two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollar budget has meant with much more opportunity to build our profile out there combining that with the new brand launch is as I said I think we 're we 're still in the starting stages of that process we launched it in August we have seen some positive results coming into the summer I haven 't got the January guest night figures for you but I 've had some operators telling me that it 's their best ever summer on record and we 've also had hoteliers that have had eighty-two percent occupancy since January so I do think there is some indications that were in a very positive sign and I think we can take some credit from the domestic campaign in those results a number of things we did you know both in the last calendar year and in the last financial year been around building our marketing tools improving our video presentation our brochures at flags making sure it 's all coordinated without new branding so that 's been a taken a lot of work as has the transition to the new board structure and I just think you know from a management point of view that has been a huge amount of work and I thank head and pulling that together but it is when you look at what we achieved last year I think you need to keep this in mind the other things that would you know focused on I 've mentioned there some of the events that we 're getting behind I also want to point out the teroni longoria door visitors strategy I think you know this has been an important piece of work for that part of our district and say we 're trying to work with the community board and the promotion Association and other stakeholders down mentor to help keep that going along I 've been talking to kirsty in monkey know about doing something similar region the other things knows our work in Australia we have got a strong PR campaign over there at the moment as well as an AdWords campaign just to give you an idea of what we 're achieving their we just had the Australian travel writer come through last week they write for biggest or the only national newspaper in Australia and its head it 's got a readership of over 1.5 million of a luxury focus but that kind of publicity and you know from an advertising rate is much much higher than what we 're paying through the public relations channels that were working in Australia the other thing we 're doing is the AdWords campaign I don 't want to get into too much detail but to give you an idea terms in New Zealand gave a presentation two months ago and they said that they are they 're basically investing in Edwards in Australia which helps build the search terms on to our website they said there was only two artios in the country that were in that space with them and one of them was us and the other one was Hamilton Waikato so I do think you know where we are at the forefront of some of this work and you know they said it 's the most cost-effective speeding we can do in Australia so take heart from that comment since that time we 've been talking to the industry about Australia and where we go and so I 'm like an opportunity later today just quick overview of the some of the key things we have achieved okay last year when I think it was about this time of year when we 're talking budgets I approached the council for next 100,000 of funding to go into a domestic marketing campaign on the basis that we would get 75 to it was 75 to 100 k proposal on the basis we got the same amount from the industry to match that 100k i 'm pleased to say we did get the hundred thousand and it 's allowed us to have this 225,000 dollar domestic push now what i did say at that meeting last year was that i 've come to you in prison results of our achievements in that campaign I think you have to bear in mind that 12 months of that campaign hasn 't finished yet sort of kicked off in august last year but on the sheet here if i can just refer you to that just running through some of the key results that we 've achieved so far and some of the key activities so first one there strong some of the major national papers we attracted over 2,100 entries through fits a profile of those competitions second bullet growing our consumer database with built building a an active traveler database of people interested in our region and so we 're sending out a Consumer News Leader regularly to update them on what 's available and the deals in our area our Facebook growth as social media push has been growing we 've got extra resource and now helping us with that and we 're putting posts on on a daily basis onto facebook twitter and other channels you 'll see there that we 've had two and a half thousand people that basically effectively follow us on facebook and we 're also tips of our viral video and our other destination videos we 've had seven thousand views on youtube just mention the web stats for for 126 thousand visitors what we are seeing is most of them coming through our search engines so that 's like you know the googles and of this world we 're also growing direct traffic and what we 're noticing is that topol and really pleased to say that that 's in our top five search terms now to me isn 't indicated that our branding work how do what we 've done in this domestic campaign is starting to get traction next item there is targeting both domestic and international visitors you see there sixty-six percent of our web site visits from New Zealanders predominately Auckland and Wellington which is our target markets followed by Australia UK and USA the other big area of our domestic campaign has been focused on television we believe in a duel or a multiple approach to marketing we don 't want to put it all into just online or all into just TV we 've gone for several approaches but just to show you their 360 commercials have been aired about our region on television New Zealand it 's been a combination of generic brand in commercials and we 've just shot another commercial and the last two months of a mountain biking what and it 's going to be showcasing seen these adverts have we started out targeting our immediate area around the Waikato once and an Auckland specifically so we pull back on on the local area but you know as I say I do think we 're getting some strong brand awareness through that and you 've got to invest in brand awareness first and foremost something you have to keep doing you know I 'd be really disappointed if if we had to pull right back on that going into next year because it takes time I 'm also saying that to the industry you need to have patience to allow these branding and marketing efforts that we 're doing to come through you don 't turn the New Zealand economy around in three years very easily so the government is finding that at the moment and I think it 's the same for our economy you know it takes more than six or twelve months to turn the ship around and get it go in the right direction so what I ask for is some patients from the industry and from the council and allowing us to stick to our guns and get the results the next one there is before we 've had some major exposure in the Dominion Post sunday star-times New Zealand Herald and a number of other industry publications as I say that as again brand profile out there we 've tried to move towards more of a call to action and I forgot to mention as well for TV we 're doing the same we 're now with our operator adverts trying to say to them look here 's a package deal come on handbook we 're finding it 's pretty tough going getting the conversion from those adverts it 's fair to say the phones aren 't ringing hot every time we put an advert out up there but what we have noticed is that operators have expressed to us that they are seeing growth in certain areas like for example Debrett 's I 've had growth in their Facebook pages which is part of where their package was pushing recently on the TV we 've had bayview Iraqi resort as one of their major joint venture partners and January they were on the month for the month and basically they sold an extra to see some conversion coming through and we 're getting better at it we 've got the huntley billboard and that 's basically going to be up right through the Rugby World Cup campaign now that has 16,000 traffic movements past it southbound every day so you know that 's the sort of exposure of getting from those sorts of initiatives and having that extra budget we 've also got that our domestic was the guide we 've bumped that up to 100,000 copies this year partly in response to the Rugby World Cup but also that is used by a domestic market trying to put it in the right locations a couple of other things we 've done our is it national PR work 15 national and local press release stories it 's important we 're out there and people know what we 're up to and finally a an important part of our website approaches to drive deals seeing a lot of growth and things like the grab one websites which is all about offering deals to industry and we 're following the same pattern an hour on deals page on great lake top or since we 've started so we 're really encouraging our operators to offer good value deals to not it not so much discounting but good value deals forever so that 's a quick run through of the key results today to say I hope to have more at our 12 months report for you but you know I just hope that gives you an indication of the level of work we 're doing and that we are getting some good results out there any questions on it no don 't oh nice I mean you 're obviously got great success on the electronic and media and the exposure and they 'll successful of you produce figures what I 'd like to say is that I 'm not being aggressive milk you 've got challenges ahead and one of them is off season of visitations and that 's you 've got a face because the town dies in the window the other one is the extended stay of topo is only one point seven nights which tells us that we 're just a pit and the other one is that international visitations and I say this in events has gone up three hundred percent in five years ends of the cycling alone we 're up to 20,000 people come here recycling so we have got some areas of success that I think you can reflect on and perhaps build on other what you 're doing so i think the events industry of course is still flourishing in this town and i think i do it doesn 't not mentioned at all anywhere when I think that 's a given isn 't it that we 've got a lot of things going for us all the activities for the sweaty things you know it 's got to get for the num sweaters and it 's yo it 's pleasing to see the moves of the council making the results into those other events but you know we certainly are trying to make sure that our existing budget is pushing the key events things like rugby world cup we 're presenting our Vice project plan to or marketing plan to committee later this week and you their resources as best we can we 've put out an email flyer to their 30,000 members fence on their database and we 've got counting on our website pages on our homepage for those needs cycle challenge of hippy are in Australia that 's putting articles out there I think that 's had good pick up it had an article in The Australian business review and that 's a national circulation in Australia so other sorts of initiatives that we can draw on throughout our marketing comprehensive marketing we don 't just right away keep moving on counter downer he comes with it I just I know it 's not in that I can 't see it in the marketing program but one of the things that I don 't know how much work you 've done and that is from the top layer down to the bottom layer say a international visitors looking up tourism New Zealand where do we set you know as a identity avail ourselves we 've got new branding but we part of waikato are we part of that linear we 're part of in there it 's a good question I mean one of the things we 're putting into a lot of thinking going forward and we just touched on this in the past too is around our web strategy in online digital strategy and we want to grow our own website but it 's also making sure that it profiles got on other websites like towards New Zealand they get a huge number of international visitors so we 're trying to build our profile bit we 're currently trying to hassle the both towards New Zealand and the Rugby World Cup organisation about our lack of profile on the arrow key World Cup site i think it 's it 's poor the presence they 've given to host regions so that 's another thing that sort of links them to what you say coming back to you know Bay of Plenty Waikato I think it 's fair to say we we want to work with joint ventures and the industry said they want us to work with joint ventures with their neighboring regions where it suits us but what we 're and wanaka are doing they are very much blatantly pushing their own brands first and then the macro region second are we going with us say the rotor or you know the airport be in the Central Park that got presented to us you know say a year ago I was that going because that was the neck aqua center it was kind of a big thing that 's right you know kind of the Central Park suited el el our areas and what we provide as a destination in activity so how is that working out yep I think you know it 's we can be honest and say that for this financial year from July last year when pulled out of Central Park and part of that was the board felt well the interim board at that time felt very uncomfortable with the level of results we were getting out of Rotorua in terms of the flights coming in we were getting good information on how well our campaign work was doing over there there 's a couple of other things you should know about Central Park and that was Bay of Plenty Hawke 's Bay and coromandel and they were citing that the brand didn 't represent them effectively and they were concerned about their level of representation so there have been some really there have been I guess some fundamental issues with the central park positioning both from a branding and web point of view it 's fair to say some of those have been fixed now and the industry has said that they still want us to be involved in Central Park but we 're looking at that conditionally and saying well we will still support that but what we want to make sure is that our own brand is the abuse and foremost and Rotorua 's doing exactly they 're there for example their investment Central Park this year is sixty thousand dollars the investment in Central Park that focuses on Rotorua is 270,000 so I want to make sure and the industry i think is supporting us now and saying that the money we invest in central park or whatever other australian JV we do it 's got to leave a legacy about of central park falls over in three or four years we want to make sure that our awareness or visitor 's awareness in australia of liked oh boys as as high as it can be so that 's kind of where the thinking Zach young we 're not going to put all of our eggs into a macro brand that may not deliver for our region want em constipation yeah just I think the app different form but I quite consume that we we are lost and now identification is in our area when you look at we 've got four territorial regional councils you 've got you know when we look at King country rugby it 's you know in that area the Health Board and you know using our tourism you know when people I 'm done talking from the top layer down and it 's fine having a great brand and that is a great brand it is performing but unless you can filter down into that brand you know we need to have actual identity of ourselves and probably it goes outside you know destination great I think it is a concern that we need to look at is accountable _"

Vinson do you accept that nomination thank you the next one is a really really it only meets four times a year but it 's a very important committee its environment work at a regional transport committee counsel well spent many many years almost he traveled many times to Hamilton he was a strong advocate in the past but the ETA issues of importance was roading and what have you sold them I tried I 've must be quite fretting quite honest am I just simply wouldn 't hit the time for myself I tried at the start but it was just impossible it is a quite a heavy workload so I nominations for the environment wake at a regional transport committee when elected member you 're only an advocate and an advisor in advisory capacity council get very hickling see denomination any further nominate sorry can we do for both 89 yeah it 's going to get to that so they are separate and they have to be done separately but i would if there 's no other nominations and I 'm yet to call for that I would suggest that they won on the same this number nine environment wake at a regional primary transport subcommittee new it 's a new subcommittee it 's got me a little bit flummoxed because I can 't understand how you advise yourself as to what to do but they have done it so well yes there was any further nominations it being none would counsel hickling do you accept nomination to both committees yes I do you worship and let 's thank you for your support favor I 'm just through Maricopa um I just would there was no call for further nominations for the lake subcommittee there the lake taupo catchment liaison I 'm dealing with the nitrogen issue on the protection subcommittee so I feel as perhaps a need actually be involved in that as well and I 've been approached by the time I River advocates and Turing overreacted and they were pretty keen to have somebody from that interlake involved in that back to that so let me finish off eighth and nine we had a double nomination of council heckling we had it seconded we had no further nominations we went to a vote that so carried over there right thank you referring back to number seven did I call for further nominations in a minute please you know they 've met my duty to do so who was the first nomination I counselor minchev was nominated by treatments or call for further nominations Emerson okay have a seconder councillor Williams do I have any further nominations which question so i use here do we just about in room Ezrin wash our hands ok so I 'll do it an order of that how they were nominated counselor Mincher was nominated I believe our council heckling and was favor of supporting councilman chappuis prop your hand those in favor of supporting councilor indocin of your hands come to my beautiful so even like production Johnson roulette it rewarded on the lightest on I got Rex I hereby declare come to fill the position of Lake Taupo catchment liaison subcommittee of aw the elected member who is an advocate in an advisor moving now please wish I was like just like to remind Rex that 's when you get put in the gun I opposed to you and I had to vote for you because I nominated you into a good fun good fun long as the district is served well that point metal appointments that may be an elected member and because they may be they also may not be so it 's up to you to discuss it and talk about it why Ricky Tourism Development Committee i think is going to be quite important going forward in this trade in because we have reached at long last after a lot of efficacy to central government and dealing with bureaucrats and what have you so you know wasn 't as the first of december the woke the controlling of the wire aki torturous park has been taken and given two limbs which is land information news ilum there rosario office will be handling applications for tourist attractions and anybody wants to rent land and build things and what have you in conjunction with napa district council so not only we getting our road back as a local road in the strain in another 11 months time so we can have egress and entrances off the state highway which has just been a nightmare to deal with in the past we now also have the ability to be able to vet along with land information new zealand known as lens on approving or disapproving of applicants and what so I think this is going to be an important role going forward as as as it builds up steam and we try to get more economic growth than to tabu which of course revulsion the visitor industry which predominantly should should emulate from the Y key tourist park so I think that we should have an elected member on for nominations I need to do you agree with that because this is a maybe or may not be situation do you wish to elect remember to the wire key tourism development committee of which has already got fruits for comment you do right now I will now call for nominations of an elected member which has a vote as does the other voting member mr. Fox focus oh I call for nominations councillor Craig to nominate councillor works mention all this position seek and that is being nominated by come to curtain I heard a second someone second yep seeking it counselor Henderson any further nominations comes recoup nominate account to cook nominating counselor Chris Johnson any seconder for that ticketed by cancer downer any further nominations okay once again I 'm going to have to take this to the vote so we started off with councillor dementia and we had counselor Johnson we went to to this yes I just wonder opportunity well if we had to would we want to replace fruits fault sincerely had to equipment the cattle I don 't think I 'd be keen he just had to be on running with destination lake taupo no compass development manager of year I 'm not be on a team this is a this is a local government central government join your committee and that 's rules are set the you can have to equipment that they will have to equipment and it makes recommendations to the perpetuity Krishnaveni Commissioner of glands if you say yes these people we recommend that they have at least your recommendation then goes to the Commissioner glands and that 's how this new system will work for we want to get that land out there utilized and opened up and I think the best but we if we could expand this committee I would certainly support that public art I was actually going to put my own name for as well but I 'll go back out of us because I could normally act on its officio role but I do get a lot of people that come to my office with problems out there etc plastic cases the lady that set up at the airport you couldn 't wasn council down up cancel dinner now what are you hand we got rounds delica hella Corey I thought you said you were coming today sir thank you your worship I just want a question for een if like these two nominations and there 's actually a third person sets interested can we have those three because I think this is so important it is a big parcel of land between taupe or and and were key and whatever happens out there is so important to our district can we have more than two people one that one person but only have one vote at the end of the day whether we decide that go to those and an ear and heavily voices as well my suggestion would be that we actually talked two nuns now the situation has been is that the the ministry of tourism has actually been they previously been the convener of this committee and now that because of the changes that have occurred with the Ministry of Tourism v it has been handed over to lunds we haven 't actually met with the new administrators of make your two appointments and but that we could actually then ask linds whether it 's possible to have an observer who can who can attend the meetings and you might want to put forward and observe it a day but recognizing that lens would have the right to turn back say no that 's not possible or as it as possible I 'd actually like to suggest that we actually suspend this I don 't_''_744.31 I wrecked you like to suspend us because i liked India Council to understand a bit more about this going forward Howland 's is proposing to set it up maybe just do a little bit more work on us if we could have and one of the next workshops we have if we could have 15 mar delicated for this more information from Lunds because all of us here want that why Ricky tourist park to go forward so I 'm going to propose to suspend us with your with your help Team I agree with that worship it 's been a hot potato for so many years it 's got so many components actually made it i 'm really thrilled to bits and I 'm not taking the credit for it implied that Louise up to turn my predecessors I 've been involved in the scrap we have a breakthrough on a hand we 've had central government actually capitulate take the control of it away from the documents that morons or women when the people that had it and they 've now given some local control to a local body and partnership with a government department and Rotorua so easy for us to correlate and talk and work together it 's important going forward which with the ETA met so if you 'll support me suspend this and in annex which we could have 15 months on this and some more linkage packed with limbs and even if we could have bite them to come never talk to it so we can get the show on the road it would be my suggestions so all those in favor that like you gotta hold Harvey Kim Leith consultative group that 's one appointment it 's an observer and a monitor meets once a I believe I would actually like to nominate Rick 's mincha because I think it ties in with setup awake at all because it 's now that they 've set up that working group with the cleaning up of the river it does english or okay cancer treatment nominates councilman sure if that second taken by councillor cook do you accept that nomination miss Clinton thank you very much any further nominations there being none all those in favor carried Tapper you start is an appointment that must not be an elected member in the past you can see on the right hand side dear mrs. Alex Wilkshire and mrs. Christine even have been on there miss Gilbert you want to be on no but you wish you look I would just like to advise that those appointees are open to being appointed again effort suits council job two hands going up into it moves counselor down out second encounter Williams Williams all those a favor carried _"

well yeah on they 're not here so we have a movie with councillor hickling for the suggested resolution we have a second the council a crate all those in favor Jared habit our ceiling ok so if what can a regional council is happy to move into the prime SWAT and be the first presenters today well the left people are doing some repairs I officially welcome you here good afternoon and thank you for inviting me along yourself today we 've just got a few slides and a brief update on some service improvements that we 've made quite recently and the front slide there has the new bass back that we 've put on the local bus and highlighting lake taupo and so on the twenty-ninth of july we introduced some revised timetable I 'm quite sure he 'll be strobes and we made the changes to the timetable in light of feedback and customer consultation early in the year we came and presented to council what got their direction in terms of how we should take the service forward and the service has been going for a number of move quickly along to the next slide this one here I just wanted to put things into perspective really currently the service carries about 20,000 trips per annum and the farebox recovery of the current service is about 12% in terms of our targets that were required to achieve regionally we have a forty percent target that we must achieve by 2017 working very hard in terms of the rest of the network that we operate and to get that farebox recovery rate up so find a number of optimization changes and with a networking Hamilton and other services and we 're currently tracking at thirty six point seven percent as a regional average to some services in our region are doing better than that some are worse although you 've got a 12-percent farebox recovery ratio it 's not the worst in the region so take some heart in there and absolutely add can 't open so so that forty percent Edwin that 's regional it 's a regional task individual services not individual services that we in our current passenger transport plan we do have criteria under which less than twenty-five percent for any service then we 'll look at that service how its performing and steps we can take to to alleviate that or improve that so I 'll flick back to the other slide so we 've got the new format timetable some different route options or service options there so we 've got were a key twice a day it goes by the hooker fall so there 's potential to tap into potential tourism there and we 've tidied the timetable up to make it more efficient so we made those changes at no extra cost so it 's within the existing budget for the service so the aim is to generate more patronage hopefully increase revenue and provide a better service to everyone so it 's only been going for about a month the new service so we haven 't got actual patronage from the new service yet that will have some later on that we be able to share with you and we keeping a very close eye on how that service will perform so some of the things that we 've done 'm not sure if you 've seen in the d marketing initiatives that we 've undertaken or heard with them yes no no feedback year okay so we 've had people subscribing to try and win an ipod because that was one of the promotions we had use the bus use the ticket there or tell us where the bus stops near to you and so they 've been quite popular I think we 've had over 250 local people saying this is one nearest bus stop at one of those promotions we 've a timetable drop we 've had newspaper adverts and we 're planning to do some follow-up advertising tea and point i 'd like to make is that why keller regional council has done that and for its own funds so we 've made that investment to try and get the service working in a better way and there 's some examples then you can see the bike right on the front of the bus that we 've introduced that 's the trial server the trial it 's the first one in the region we know that quite pleased and so we 've got this nice positive messaging around the service so basically it 's early days in terms of the new service and we 're hoping that in two or three months time we 'll be able to give you some positive feedback on how changes have made a difference the other thing I wanted to talk to you about today is the changes that total mobility scheme and previously we had one of the few places in the country which wasn 't consistent with the National Ski so actually moving to a nationally consistent scheme on the first of October that will open up a scheme membership to a wider participation and it takes away the restriction that used to exist in terms of the town boundary limit so instead of having a town boundary limit there 'll be a maximum fair subsidy per trip that can be paid and so based on the research that 's been undertaken it 's been set at 12 50 and that 's based on the 95th percentile so ninety-five percent of journeys on the current looking at current nationally consistent scheme is it that it attracts a high rate of subsidy from so previously it was on forty percent subsidy and it will move to sixty percent subsidy that means you 'll be able to do more with the same amount of money and scheme changes take place on the first of October we 've set up a hotline or free hotline so people can call in and find out about scheme changes and that 's an that 's a cool center that 's open I think it 's seven days a weeks they can phone it only to chatroulette but it 's they 're able to find through it 's a free phone number we 've been doing the training with the agencies and providers for total mobility so they 're away aware of how that will transition through so we 're looking forward to that and our existing users at the total mobility scheme looking forward to the changes too and that 's just a just some of the information we 've got some postcards that we 've sent out to people so they 're aware valid at the end of the year so there 's a transition period where you can swap pouches over so do you have any questions yes I do you want to Henderson first I 've got a few questions mostly quite short but i 'll come back some of them later on um you see that it 's got twelve percent cost recovery at the moment the goal is 40 by 2017 two questions what happens if that goals not met and if also if you 're doing 25 thousand trips per annum now roughly how many would you estimate you need to be doing to meet that forty percent cost recovery I in this inverted us both the two questions the first one in terms of fare box recovery i have not had a discussion with our key investor which is ended ta saying we can 't meet that target and we 're on looking at how we 've tracked we 've improved our regional fare box recovery blagged a half percent in the last year and so we 've taken great steps to move that forward and the i suppose it depends on the type of customers were carrying in the revenue that we can generate from them so it 's not hard and fast but i hope we could get up to between 40 to 50 thousand trips random that would be the target i would like to see you tune it to be questions comes okay well considering webcams line and we have got a little bit of an audience here today I just want to recap something and a few issues here so this whole bus service is paid fifty percent by MZ t a two-hundred-thousand-dollar approximately and fifty percent by tap a district council two hundred thousand dollars so could you go back to your last slide please they did that one you just hit up this phone or get to that so now that it 's like this yeah so you 're into work at a regional councils regional annual plan I submitted very strongly that I was extremely upset as the mayor of the town that we couldn 't be masters of our own destiny and what I meant by that was a Sunday and I see a 40 seater lumbering bass go past my restaurant I 'm the only person in my race traitor i just seen why are we paying wake at a regional council four thousand dollars a month to run our bus service and then we go out and we do all these lovely things for people with mobility disadvantages in that and we anadrol branded waikato regional council now i submitted that the annual plan on behalf of this council for you guys to delegate the running of that bus service back to this council to our very able people dennis and clear Sharland and a few others then we had a meeting at way tony with a bunch of very upset people because they stopped the bus service to white and internet once again i asked the CEO to ask the new CEO of waikato regional council to please reply to my submission to the annual plan which has still not been replied to which is my request that I 'm saying it again to return the bus service to taupo save us forty eight thousand and even save you having to drive down here today to in the interest of the environment etcetera etcetera so win and i 'm looking at this here wake at a regional council lovely doing all this for everybody when will just be transferred back to top it because everything you 're telling me here has a long-term feel about it I 'm afraid I 'm unable to comment or answer what would you please more requested so on video came back to your CEO I can take I can take those questions back any other questions in second um the total mobility scheme is quite separate to the actual public transport press the car m town that 's correct they 're two separate programs and they come from two different separate areas of funding and the total ability scape that 's more of a personal account service the todavia little scheme is a subsidized taxi service and for people with mobility needs or ability impairments and there 's certain eligibility criteria so it 's not open to everybody but it is a national scheme ok Thank You counsel German people that live in mannequin or automatic religious so so previously there was no ability to provide it outside a boundary because it was Geographic there was a geographic boundary and they are people within the district are now eligible to join that scheme that they do need to have a total ability provider who 's able to make that to provide that trip for them so it 's not just any taxi that can provide back we 've just got a new community vain yeah so the community then teach me do this today besides environment I have to make certain criteria to be members of the total mobility scheme to provide those services so they serve criteria and if I can take your details post the meeting or post my session I can get some feedback on it and then you can direct them to the right place Williams we did have a presentation another or a consultant that you had to to look at ways of improvement on senior quite concerned it 's rate could you tell me when we made the presentation to topple district coats figure in this year yes Gnaeus comments it does seem when we were so concerned about the location of the inlet say means so long to change those increase from the numbers since i have 2x be some yeah i take i concur with comfortably of us comments and at the end of the day is to have a district council ratepayers money that 's paying for this and i believe they should be running your own good bus service and not promoting work at a regional council min counted em up i was just going to say that they are running it thirty six point seven percent don 't you to reach the 40 so it 's you 're not that far and you 've increased it regionally by eight nerve saint engine so with these changes with at over which we discussed it workshop going purse hook a falls and stuff I there then hopefully that will pick up none of my fellow councillors disappointed that you submitted to wake at a regional council annual Brandon you haven 't even had a reply like people that submit to even had a reply with any person us until in some um Michael public transport work and pay is very difficult it seemed from what you 've said to us today that what you 're delivering in this district is in line with what you 're delivering in other areas in terms of the usage and Patrick is roughly would that be would there be the case where we were soft feel better off how does it stack up that 's a very interesting question counselor I think across the region where you have very different travel patterns it 's not uniform or consistent so we have a mixture of urban and rural and and we have town Oh which is separate from the rest of our network it 's not connected into the main sort of regional center which is Hamilton and so it 's got different needs associated with that in terms of typical patronage to repeat bus and the network here is predicated on one peak bus we 'd expect at least a hundred fails and trips for that big bus so you can see there 's is carrying and what would carry that resource if it was applied elsewhere within the region or what we could expect it to achieve girls were in the league and we 've got areas of growth in the region so we 've got really strong trends there in terms of the satellites has been into Hamilton at the moment so working with white bar and Waikato we 're tapping into that and providing alternatives commuters there so to get back to what was meant in terms of patronage looking at this particular market we wouldn 't expect 200,000 because that 's not realistic based on what you have here in terms of looking at that market assessment that somewhere between 40 and 50 it seems to be the number that we should be aiming for in terms of patronage Christian in terms of getting there what are the site or three things that you think of the most critical to change to give it to achieve those numbers I think we 've we 've made some of those changes in terms of we 've looked at where we weren 't that we 've discontinued there because they weren 't carrying passengers we focused on having a more usable service and in terms of out to Jarden mile with a number of return trips there that 's been increased and we 've also looking at how we can promote it locally and also work with some businesses locally to try and generate additional trips nothing further from fellow councillors thank you very much for coming down from Hamilton and presenting us with how our bus service runs and telephone and how good or not so good it

Park i knows we 've also got a local controller here mr. Howard so well answer all the questions that you may have this is just really a mechanical matter in terms of we traditionally used the no longer a Bible in terms of a requirement for a post-disaster facility and therefore we have been looking other options and this item suggests that the modifications to the current CD rooms across the way and the prefab bullying is the best option we can achieve at this point in time questions countless what you actually have to the building mr. Fox let 's to referring to the prefab building at the very end of that property here yes we have to do some link to the city- teams to cheer and also this embracing as well to walls in two piles mr. Parker 's it link is quite correct seismic issues or quake or something of similar so this is really a maintenance I commission of it oh I 'll move Oh things haven 't gone okay move counter downer taking the counter cook all those in favor say aye and budget of item must come to counsel if you know item number nine is this authorization of exchange reserve landed kinloch we 've been through this one is this the same one that we 've done it right one you would have would have lost dealt with us a couple of months ago when we I came to you asking for permission to publicly notify we 've since notified it we 've had no submissions so it 's really just a mechanical process of passing the resolution that enables you to apologize to care mr. how would that lift is not working you need a hand down the stairs okay so I think you all remember this one has been to council two or three times now been advertised as I think I heard you just say yes and the submission period close with no submissions for or against elder council innocent moves motion counter William seeking to the loads of favor okay agenda item number 10 is the council project performance report business plan we got give us the green and I 'll take it mr. two minutes it 's pretty standard once here we have to have projects in the proposed milestones that we report back to you on a monthly and quarterly basis these are the projects that we 've identified for rum for end if you 're happy with those either suggest resolution to receive them hey we just got the question isn 't so good William yes to Swan question of mr. green um could you update us on the museum governance options I understood that they were to be presented at the circus meeting I 'm nomis three mr. chairman they are currently waiting with our partners to free talk for their feedback so we 're essentially in their hands at the stage you have a further question clarity etc be none is a suggested resolution on timber one that come to receive the business plan for the council project performance award for two thousand thirteen and fourteen to Jim McGee remover move come to Johnson think a nerd comes from a crate all those in favor say aye moving off number eleven chief executive of chief executive report mr. Williams Thank You mr. chair and yet I mean that there 's this report is sort of a transition rapport between last financial year and the commencement of this financial year so you 'll notice some commentary on Pradesh 's projects projects that are it that are still continuing and no major issues in there although we do have project managers in the room if there are some specific questions about those projects the key issues to note in this report summary other arm only around the central government legislative changes I think it 's just important for counselors to be aware very much of the changes in the resource Sgt area they 've been highlighted through the report there are some big issue use that we may need to deal with into the future and staff will endeavor to keep elected members up to speed as we understand what those changes are more and more I just wonder em for their the leaks Council with it it might be appropriate for Lisa of invitation to the minister Amy Adams to be sipped cabin address peps staff and counselors on so they can be considered yes yeah always difficult to get a minister into the room but if we can take an opportunity to do that then why wouldn 't we um miss Williams i know this report would have been give me that these turrets which i 've been very keen on helping to promote at ming kee kee de la camara are going to be in by the end of summer yeah I knew assurance was that even though they 're all the other she just waiting for that want us to arrive everything sorted for them and we 're down to a stage of wishing our painting and type plants to plant around them and the representative group was updated on it last week that meeting something that we 'd promised to have done to those people out here we got really are bombarded about it we 've made a promise i was about to make sure their promises completed by the in September anything further from anybody comes Williams with regards to enviromental meters that 's not and miss Williams 's report but they have we had any feedback regards to either Waikato Regional Council I 've got to what 's reviewing them Mighty River Power resource conceived I have person I don 't know if Gareth so do anything through some staff involvement and they 're reviewed and I understand that we 're going to get a copy of all those reviews within the next couple of weeks and the final decision will be made within the next couple of months I understand green if I could just clarify it I 've been told in no uncertain terms that it 's Molly governor 's decision it 's going to be done by management officers primarily the couple of officers that have presented to here in the past it 's my understanding correct my understanding which I don 't think I concur with however I thought government governed and management made those government 's resolutions but however that 's what I 've been told as well I think you can read what you want to into that regards to that when they when that comes out as at the Mandate of this council to have any Commodore involvement and whatever the decision as by the way to Regional Council you mustn 't even the decision of the regional council was the decision of the Regional Council so we don 't get an opportunity to feedback more and later and have serious conversations and obviously once the decision is made then it 's up to this council when any other party about what you do with that if you 're dissatisfied with a decision only opportunity to have if you had two satisfied with that decision there 's a judicial process which would cost a lot of money a lot of time now I don 't think this council we 've discussed it before would have the appetite to take that on Justin put the capital projects update under the AC bars refurbishment stage to her the key risks of additional funding required for the new cafe embalming Island scope changes when is that going to be formally addressed Andrew still trying to get though all the costs and get them pretty robust so that we can present it to cuz those lights off to help webcam or just wonder what was so dark to me Counsell Williams I something on the the working party along with cancer crate and Cutler and we we soon have more up-to-date information than what 's prepared here I see that this of June I just wondered ever to be a appropriate you worship to ask mr. Bowden to give us that 's all an update because things have certainly moved along mr. Bowden if you 're going to reply could you come foot and speaking of the speaker we have webcam on and you want to complaints about in volume and audio issues thanks thank you this is a timing issue mum three the time this report was put together we haven 't agreed with the contractor what the progress claim was for that month we have some variations that we were at odds with him on so rather than put a guesstimate or on an erroneous amount in here I decided just to keep it as it was for June when we issue the next report in September this will be for a month for and it will definitely be up today but it was just a timing issue counselor I apologize for that but term there were some variations that we were not serious odds with the contractor and it took a while to get those agreed we have here okay so I 'd rather give you not give you erroneous information and I kept it a month to I know that you 're proceeding on the September meeting but I think would be a good idea to signal to councils that you know there has been quite a number of unexpected and problematic areas that hit to be addressed over and above the contract prudent that we advise I 'll be doing that we signaled it now because it does not black yes sir move is not kind of bait I won 't be the new cafe is a scope change that was never in the scope it was diagrammatic on the construction drawings the bomb in Ireland we were doing no work there when we took a cool ring off the bombing Island the slab was cracked broken in many places hadn 't been constructed properly subsequent to that we 've taken the slab off we have costs to recommit Irial below which hadn 't been compacted very well put a new slab on and then a non-slip cover over the top I have those costs now to swim pool and they endure a leisure pool when we open that up that was full of rust so wouldn 't have lasted very long I 'll be a year two years so we 've obtained a price from the contractor to replace that duct in putting new as it is concealed and I 'm confident that that will last but probably about 25 years from now so these things have just come about as we 've done the demolition worked I started to do some of the construction work I 've got a quite a new one as well these you walk down the stairs and you face like a service area than the bottom that 's a separate building to the remainder of the facility and it 's it was constructed i would say about 20-25 years ago we had to cut an opening between two rooms in existing block work and when we did that we found the block work has no reinforcement in it it 's not structurally sound and supposed to be supporting the slab of floral the roofs love above it so we seismic perspective bear in mind that is a quite a heavily trafficked area by the public he 's given a design to address that I haven 't got the cost for that yet that 's why it 's going to be in September but i 'll be putting that forward as well and again for public safety health and safety issue if we have until cut the hole in the block one we 'd never have known discovery with regrets and so yeah we 've found outside there 's a stormwater sump in the concrete which is connected to the foul sewer which is illegal so we 're going to have to reroute that into the adjacent stormwater system so these little for want of a better description surprises are popping up all the time I 'm hopeful they 'll come to an end as we are trying to close in their return I think we found most of them so that 's why I can 't do it this month but i will be doing it in detail for the next meeting is septum we were all on the in keeping with the new construction areas stage 1 and stage 2 so I you to make some comments to accounts look about pruning there after scratch so that it 's not a visually um you know that doesn 't swallow we reviewed we reviewed doing quite a bit of work in that area those costs with that we discussed with working group were prohibitive there are over a million dollars so a working group decided we weren 't going to proceed with that last night I received an updated marked up layout of the area from the architect with a view to basically decorate in the area it is an extreme minimalist approach so when you walk down the corridor it 'll look a lot better than it is now it 's very tired at the moment and you 'll be walking from a new area which is the indoor 25 meter pool and the indoor leisure pool if you went in there now it would look extremely tight so we 're going to it 's basically painting on some new flooring and that 's it so I received 've sent it on to the quantity surveyor for a cost estimate i 'll be submitting that cost as well at next month 's meet um to questions of all the things you 've just outlined most of them sound to me although not all of them saraly but most that they 're um things that you found during the process of doing the job that could be classified as design flaws from the previous boat to somebody the cafe is a new cover yes so that 's not yes a bombing Island definitely is oddly constructed again but hidden the the area of the stairs with the additional steel work for seismic purposes that 's just that 's just bringing the building up to code we have addressed seismically indoor 25 meter pool we 've addressed seismically the indoor leisure pool and then at this this area which is a completely separate building will address that there as well but if we haven 't have opened up the block we 're willing to phone them my second question as you 've mentioned you 've costs and some of those to discuss those costs no album I 'd rather present all the information together I haven 't got the cost for the cafe yet I haven 't got the cost for the seismic work I 've got the cost for the bombing island and the cafe is still a bit up in the air hopefully this week we 'll have the new layout for the cafe signed off by the operator and then the architect will then complete the detailed design and I 'll give that to the quantity surveyor for a cost estimate sewn up ok so I 'll pull all those together in one in one package but provide detail for each one and why we need to do thanks I hear from come to Henderson made a point of bed design but does this bed design or just just shonky builders I mean what pipe has put into what pipe did you say before since the refurbishment yeah 10 years ago there 's been one or two stormwater it 's like a drain really in the concrete and the one that we fact that there are quite to start off with goes straight into the foul sewer whilst there 's a stormwater mono closer so somebody has just cut it out put a new pipe in and put it into their foul system which is as you know well it 's illegal is illegal shonky workmanship isn 't it yeah somebody 's yeah it is him yes sir I know any boys I 've been involved and get quite thoroughly by inspectors that was allowed to take place they see that 's actually a caller agree and it 's only ten years ago to modern age just to clarify when I said design I should have probably more accurately said design and or workmanship but I would also include in that some of the asset management practices of the past which seemed to attend up a number of problems with regards to the facility to say so it asset management going forward just for your information I got a phone call today from gray City Council in greymouth who put a swimming pool that 's got very similar problems to the one that we 've encountered throughout sale in the floor tiles so the ceiling tiles and the structure as well that some of their problems are even worse than what we 've encountered so might be well she 's not comforting we 're not alone well that doesn 't give me much comfort I know we came seek enough to walk a tiny from the same builders too but five million door debacle but it 's only my personal opinion but I don 't believe from in pushing a British on them cuz hottia raises rises okay so anything feather it be nothing what 's sorry come too good I 'm not regarding AC bars but just we 're just in regards to the communications plan yeah at the top it 's got that it 's you know contribution to the TDC business played 2013-14 that there seems to be a lot of past stuff in here and then I 've got a couple of gray pages which I 'm hip dates before but also those gray pages on 11 15 have way data connector bus changes and it seems that TDC have contributed to fast and their presentation said that they had picked up the marketing so all the changes so don 't have an answer to that I 'm afraid but I can find out for you and what I will say is we think we have just pointed a new communications manager so hopefully you know that the tea will be able to tidy this up a little bit or for the next council meeting doesn 't that strike to the heart of what I said before when I put the slide up there where you apply for the set down and white head of regional council CDC 's money thank you okay comes Williams I just getting back to the AC bars um the or the S the S it manager we were matter in this hit manager we have you got to as I probably in the June we can I think it might have been that we have appointed a contractor to undertake that role until such time as we 've ascertained what exactly we want to bring in house our vision at the moment is that we need that is perfectly at a capable of doing the job until we make a decision and with regards to making deployment so yeah we 've got the skills and our availability the manual from the isobars manual have we watched a jury yet for that that would have been a good question for Andrew yeah but he 's left so i can find out and give it to remove and as i understand it just for some clarity they will be coming into the safety valve saga and one of the things that mr. Bowden has been is to do under his contract is to have that manual that management program supplied before he finishes up here on his contract for ask for you or someone going forward to adhere to so we don 't end up in the same damn problem again that mug a bit clearer absolutely not just the AC birds but the event center and then any other building that has complex equipment associated with it so I might be missing something here but we should be moving a motion that we receive that chief exhibit of it all about to make sorry that the chief exemptions report for august 2013 be received come to the henderson and Counsell Williams all those in favor aye _"

    "text": "I will jump the car moving been out have a district council draft annual plan report which you have which is only a draft with a personal um and it 's an order to do I believe it 's that the audit office now do you want to speak to it all yeah the draft yep gerroff not going to take team I will open up the council 's do you have any questions on the draft annual report go up to 13 please tips before you die here so just making a comment that one is apologies you only got a day it 's literally hot off the press seeking me you 'll note that there are some meters which will parts about which aren 't complete and notably there 's some of the numbers the Me 's report chief executive officers report etc and it 's again just because of the timing you 'll remember that this is an extra step in the process that you last forth in terms of looking at this before winter order which is unusual so it 's not quite in its complete really good understanding of them of we were setting them what the structure is in a bit if i can add to that as far as the financials are concerned but we 've ordered at the moment and we will get the financials to the next order for risk committee meeting the forecast that we gave you in the june council meeting is still pretty much online this being some revaluations of assets and on buildings and land which is of effect at the bottom line but that 's just an annual revaluation basis so we 're still going to finish the year with a loan book 17 million lower than what we budgeted and our profit before the free valuation will still be there six million bit of than we originally budgeted for so that 's very much in line with what we indicated at the june council meeting any questions on anybody sorry he big bigger mob sorry my counter do they include the savings of effects to unit that 's great yes six mobile saver so there was about a couple million in operational savings and the 104 yes but as we will understand that we 're hitting in a pretty positive direction of you can reduce the level of debt for 17 million in one year it 's very very commendable very commendable um just a matter of clarity under the new local government the chief executive of the office have had to put out a report before an election pre-election report is that gone out yes and is that the report that 's going to be in here separate reports on our website for anybody that wants to access the pre-election report it 's on our website it 's a new thing that governments bought and it has to be done prior to an election by any chief executive officer so that anybody coming in knows exactly what they 're coming in to rather than being surprised letter anything further let me like that for okay so resolution that council does not become a party to the appeal or the hound that 's an extra at the ammo auditive to have a district council draft annual report 2012-2013 be received I think it 's also anything else related to yes we 'll go to the ordinance but move with it but moving please move cancer download taking account of Johnson all those in favor aye I cute but I hitting myself here this is the appeals to the Hawke 's Bay Regional Council regional policy statement change five we going to talk about this kara or Gareth carrot hi Kara welcome thank you dear mmm so this is willing to change five to the Hawke 's Bay Regional Council policy statement and our last agenda item officers made a topol District Council 's submission points had been largely accepted and the decision tether to change five and that there was no need at that time to appeal and but that we would keep a watching brief on the appeals that do come and have any affected our position on the submission points that we 've made anyone no appeals on those solution points so our recommendation is that there 's no need to join as a partagé those appeals McGarrity Luba I just ask what 's what 's your officers view on where it where go through I think what the main appeal points were for parties that were very much focused on their own interests and there 's a federated farmers there was a a wee group horticulture New Zealand and so they weren 't really fundamental issues with rafet change and that change is about sort of keeping up with them with the national policy statement so Robert II can 't_''_351.41 DiNozzo it 's an appellant yeah don 't think so with many submissions for it so there are therefore appeals um I 'm not sure how many overall submissions they were back at the time that pits the murder on the change I 'm just on a related matter on local government reorganisation smushes property council has produced a document about their ideas for reorganization of the Waikato which would be with they want us to take over Oh trauma and okay to disagree please move cancer cook thinking the council John towards our favorite they all right all right okay gender item number fourteen draft joint management agreement with rock our settlement trusted supplementary paper will probably remain help emissions mr. discussions with us regarding us through a workshop and you remember at that stage we 've been working on this this joint management agreement with the other councils in Ocala for some time remember at the workshop it was one issue which was outstanding which was around the council 's ability to not accept recommendations from the new joint was joined governance work that was being proposed some alternative wording has been agreed with with our trustees and I understand is of about an hour ago today broke ever have agreed to those words so those words make it really explicit that the council wasn 't bound by any recommendations that it may come from that governance group and their position has been reached through a number of discussions in officer level but also a meeting of most of the governance group and may he know last week with locals cheer and in cheerless committee so there was a general level of comfort at that stage that should those words be included the concerns that we had at their point would be would be reduced Williams is mr. Breen we Tierra revert DB trust private 30 to 40 Taiwan and also to have some involvement in it as this suggested resolution consistent with what 's and the final draft of our agreement with respect to governance issues of the turbo District Council all sorry pay pay and variational reviews of the district then as it consistent with what we agreed with kiara brother eerie trust I 'd say it 's not inconsistent so the same issue isn 't isn 't doesn 't repeat itself at the stage in their draft documentation and that they have a slightly different process and slowly governs right different governance arrangements so it 's certainly not inconsistent and I think it 's fair to say in one of the our concerns as officers with the Rope our words when it the same would be repeated through the other through territory and through to collect also he had to make sure that it was that it was pretty clear and concise in terms of this one and we 're confident that it just does that 3g I have to UM I have to express some real council 's and the region was along the locator river with respect to time and resources i understand it working to regional councils put aside a million dollars to put to do their joint management agreements for the work every River and I can just see now the time is running away on us with our the three parties that we have to form a amazing i 'm just like to put out there as the not some way that all the parties can come together with some consensus and then bring out a master document and then have them and suit their own particular wishes under that master document rather than have all these separate negotiations which taking an enormous amount of time and resources from from what I 've um that 's if I 'm to achieve they are slightly different in this because they 're slightly different in terms of their setup in what each you 're wanting and the bones of the same and so the bones are replaced but like anything when you go into a negotiation you go into it with an open mind of their relationship there 's no option anyway though is it is no there 's no option but to enter into an agreement there is an option s of what you put into row column being excellent to deal with and hasn 't cost much to come up this joint agreement I think the rest of the media would agree cancel heckling yeah if I could just so the resolution on page 7 of Mach 14 parsecs is not the resolution we want you to consider did you get this one handed out around this fashion yeah so could you cross out number two concentrate or number 1 i 'm prepared to move the suggested resolution number one your worship sigma okay and I 'll just read that resolution so we understand that council adopts a draft joint management agreement between the rock our settlement truck and top o district councillor subject to the amendment of clause 5 bar 10 to include the additional words and its decision-making cannot bind the parties move by council heckling seeking them by camps are down out all those in favor say aye aye policy for elected members now this probably should be taken as red I 'm happy to open it up to you it 's the new remuneration issues for the next triennium affects some of years not all of us miss Jake so anybody we have workshop to any questions from anybody or clarity or anything I think once again the incoming care so we 'll have the ability that we had still had at the beginning of our train em where we divided the pool rather than not anymore okay Ross already been set the next biggest Sonia Council of the Ginen of the next term have been said I asked but we had to because that 's the law I 've been set by the renovation authority ok so we 're so this is about your incidental expenses as opposed to your celery negative mileages yeah that 's great and it 's based on the draft policy the main changes are in relation to the communications area basically ok so this is where we thought Robin I talked about I paid something to next year and how you get so does anybody else have any more questions I know you have workshopped it with some mistakes mr. hip cat sleeping yeah I just like to have some clarification on 15 bar too because it 's it 's an eye its new certainly new to me where you can claim 35 dollars per hour for travel time could you just expand this is that just one way or is it that the whole travel time during the day that you travel to any during the day that you travel to that meeting so for example that you go to Hamilton and you 'll be paid for one hour basically and if you come back then you 've got a second hour but if you stay overnight the first day a leader I appreciate ya okay anybody else Oh anything over an hour if day travel allowance kicks in but what if you went to Hamilton and back up one day you just lose the first day and get paid three yeah that 's my own whatever the time is this applies to count laws and I think in here if meant the media elite dominguez so if there 's no more clarity needed around this could we have a move in a second degrees for a suggested resolution on page of item number 15 council Johnson council heckling all those in favor say aye then we go on to elected members remuneration amendment so when we had the extraordinary they can see Iran and the year the pool of money that counselors have was read avoided and this renew Maury shin authority requires back to go through as a resolution so this is the formal process to make that happen no questions or just move on a second Flint move comes to Johnson SI unit comes with down add all those in favor so I i I 'm a 17 council engagement of the month care of September reading down them there there 's nobody applying to go for anything so all we have to consider is meeting dates the airport authority will now be holding a meeting as of today 's general conversation on the 9th of September at 10 3d at the airport that right yeah yeah yes be a meeting it would be a public meeting public so

number 18 will go around the table as members reports council Henderson back there today I 'm been to a number of meetings for this one I wanted to mention which was the catch of management meeting for the upper Waikato which I attended with councillor Williams last week very interesting is a lot of work going on with development of design plans and so forth but um the reason I went along princess players i found out that our previous representative on that committee counsel immense alert months i had attended i believe one previous meeting in the past two and a half years so i felt a bit of a need to go along and build a few bridges and thank Counsell Williams and I did that successfully and the other thing worth noting is I 'm with catchment management and McLeod has now been appointed by why can 't a regional council as the area manager which is an extra resource above and beyond what they previously had on the ground here in Cabo so just an meeting in the princes a museum AGM as counsel rip I was a an official counter at the National breastfeeding electron and I 've we had said trust power Awards just at judging session emergency management committee I 'd it a safe kids new zealand meeting and we have a junior safety Expo heading at the great lakes in turn on the 16 for november attended the more FM woman in business section and the youth employment steering committee meeting the lakes dhb community have form and then i was given a tour of the redevelopment of Toy hospital by the manager Julie Alice and it 's it 's really cold I hope I never have to use it but vicinity and you say I just went along to observe the tahoe airport authority makes an active interest in found it quite informative don 't look great I 've circulated my report from the NZ IEP meeting can I just speak ER just a couple of items on that just a lever I think there is one of it Thank You vesture all for letting me go on this I man of the events industry New Zealand and met lots of people from all sorts of areas and I 've come to the conclusion that the event industry and our whole nation is in pretty good hands and it 's been well financed and there 's a lot of people in our events industry of that have got jobs overseas and I just mentioned one down there about the seventh a bullet point low and middle ditch in kiwi and she was responsible for the seventy thousand volunteers the 11 million visitors that the london olympus london olympics and she gave a a great presentation on the involvement in that one of the things that does come up in the whole thing when you talk about events and we do it here in in Topal let 's say we talk about iron man we 've got a thousand event event ease if you like participants we 've also got one point something people that come with these and they 're still visitors to s town and we 've got two thousand people that volunteer so the event is bigger than event and also the volunteers a mess I think we 've got to always keep that in mind when we look at events are now sort of in Street on the local scene ah I 'm not trying to steal a nick we 'd estándar here but I think we 're thriving I 've worked with Nick and the events team are quite a bit ly Vince capital branding is still strong they produce this booklet here that I should have got for you to put in your pigeon hole but that is just a wonderful document on our events oh and what we are hoping to do and what we 're hoping to attract and there 's plenty coming up in the next year or so for the luck some of us might be lucky enough to get voted on so we are in good heart with the whole events industry I 've underlined the challenges in our event industry and it 's in truism tripped Renly that we we do need to look at extending visitations instead of a in one day offs you know getting festivals and together and filling our winter months and it was great to see last weekend we had the Winterfest that was on at the same time as the National joslyn champs were out at the motorsport park they on the sandy I went along and dug holes for the living legends you know sir colin meads and all those people and it was just a wonderful weekend to show that we can actually fear winter weekends up so any comments on that the other attendance is of course I go to the tea mug the Talpiot road user group meets again and we 're still trying to get the safer roads in our district to sort of get a better reputation I was greatly involved in the twentieth half marathon we 've been involved in every one of them to be quite honest with barian kirsty we had our last mango key no meeting and it was quite sad because they 're probably you know might not all meet again so that was good enough I just congratulate kirsty on good chairmanship for the whole three years he 's done a the usual cycling club and all that sort of stuff meetings over the last thank you for listening and I 've been to the tutor mahoota trust 18 of into the sports advisory council meeting and just on that sports advisory council pleased to announce that contact energy or sponsoring again the swim well program for toku nagar genome tarini so that 's pretty huge keeping their numbers up and all those swimming pools and getting kids to swim 100,000 and then also attended the dog obedience I 've you know the new club rooms on Sunday I went to the mural candidate bungee jumper to celebrate winter feast week the night bungee and I see only one that jumped off no uncut my rope they 're good I also had the pleasure to go with Dominic up to turangi why why is it Mariah up and never why here for the Waikato tie noe environment plan launched and had a real great day I got invited to have lunch with the King in the air and with a lot of them ears and I know IAM elders and so with some cats love de nada attended the Citizens Advice Bureau AGM and they had some apps celebrations of some outstanding community volunteers some of her been volunteering for that organization for 20 years so that was quite something to celebrate so near 50 sets of them were governed certification also with council Henderson and as such as your counsel represented of your new council it seemed of us are Tina my second upper Waikato liaison committee meeting and Patera last Tuesday they we were specifically asked to have for hunting groups to give unput unto the zone plan and the afternoon the morning was their usual business i think as i signaled to you this committee that 's made up of land uses power companies district councils of course the way our the Regional Council ok the Regional Council and various scientists and as i would like to signal to this council is a very important committee I think especially with regards to water purity which is going to be I think a number one issue on an ongoing basis for our district and I think we need to us that there is a real concern over a river degradation there 's also a real concern over biodiversity in our district and of course pest control that goes along with it and then also erosion problems which are hand in hand I guess with our type of glenthorn so what 's been signaled as that on an ongoing basis farmers and landowners who may or councils that made it may have activities that impact on others and their immediate vicinity will have to do mate will most probably will have to be paying so so there are some issues and so I would signal to let 's get somebody on their next um train IAM who 's active and like hunt kelsey hints and i was quite ashamed and there was comments made from those members that the type of district council had not been represented for two and a half years member that we nominated to go to their had attended only one meeting at all the monthly meetings that are taking place i guess when I look around this table at all our hard-working counselors and the quite disappointed I don 't have anything especially to report I have attended a number of local to ringing things but nothing to be surely come to council 's attention from men and get so into tetanus wasn 't settlers association meeting the monthly meeting in also to the monkey nor and enterprise making or had their first meeting me they 've tried to get a business after five directly so it was a really big tune out for my familiar lots of businesses that it was the this one 's I 'm hopefully that 's going to continue so that was supportive EG LT in a little bit of representation in DG LT as well so it 's great let it continue to build and at the sports advisory council and also the tutor mojito reserve trust I also attended the annual general meeting of the typo health think it 's the health trust and they have just donated 750,000 towards some of the refurbishment the taboo hospital top of hospital there is still a shortfall because with the seismic upgrade it 's about 1.5 million so there 's is that there 's also no contingency for the landscaping of their hospital and probably the what I would dress as the internal decorations of the corridors and such like so some artwork or whatever I don 't whether people 's visited the rotor or hospital recently but some of the and certainly the new part of the rotary hospital it 's just you know it 's nice and relaxing when you walk in it 's a totally new sort of environment and I think perhaps I did I say the new council might be year cick on to try and put some artwork or do something to do probably help the local hospital I think it 's a very it 's a good community thing we 've managed to establish and keep the hospital in Taupo because at one stage that 's why they health trust was set up originally was to keep the hospital in a problem just as an idea there 's a hella lot of gifts given from me as to me is over hello it 's not what I 'm thinking they 're all sitting me we tagged at home you know the devil we do the did we don 't everything 's gone to archives and you know I would challenge new council to go and ever report to make a second lovely stuff and that 's all I 'm saying we don 't have to purchase anything I 'm sure we 've got something that would be awesome in that in nadi 230 tall would have to in the air cause you know that did stuff that I 'm sure they 'd love to be display your major generic ha schmuck you don 't a good just to follow up from that from the DHB forum last week too funny toy had been engaged with by the pilot the lakes dhb of Julie islands and they are currently working on at work from there speaks but yeah odd well I 'm sure Julie would love to hear from the vehicle someone with the other right there people themselves rightful criticals as a lot of stuff and a mister williams as you know including 650 queen okay there 's a suggested

    "text": "you go sit here got to go in spread some ashes I 'd roll through here on events okay who 's presenting this one Ellison Gareth again Johnny violation of gas supply to spar pack okay BAM just I just need to just have a glass of water obviously right so damaged spot hogg and there 's a CCTV camera that 's cited by the public toilets now when this was installed a number of years ago and it was done using solar power unfortunately we can plot a drop out because the we 've done some work to the solar power but it 's not have the desired effect fundamentally we need to get a permanent part power supply down there because we 've been getting probably a number of days have drop out which particularly with the during the winter that 's been problematic because it 's still a really busy spot down there we have budgeted for this in the draft Lantern plan but obviously that 's very draft at the moment and so may or may not and appear in its final sort of version and registers expenditures to get that permanent power supply down there so we sure we don 't get that drop out on the CCTV cameras which the which the police monitor so I 'll take any questions and so that this is a major crime spot will need coverage outside 32 and cubix that there was something that I was quite interested in and is that is quite increasing you down do you have any biggest I don 't have I don 't have any stats but we 've we 've had a number of high-profile and we 've had a couple early this year French couple had the whole of their camper van taken and this is happening what 's twice a year but this petty stuff is well going on and this is about having evidence but also because they get monitored by down the police station we can hit the crime straightaway it 's as Rob so as a major hotspot for crime and I haven 't got any figures to you and just to follow up on it like him if we were to delay a night I 'm just cheer my gonna vote against that i 'll give you the reason why over the last couple of months off me a few at a time I 've had about three hours during the day you watching the cameras I went out on a night patrol saturday night from 1015 to 4 30 or so four in the morning with the only monitoring them at night there 's a couple of things that have come up that I think we need to put into long-term plan as a total package one is the fact that some of the cameras are wireless which can cause a few problems particularly at night on setting I believe it not the main camera to photo street went down then it came back on at one o 'clock on sunday afternoon then the camera at the other end of the street was stuck covered by a big truck so there was we had to physically send the police to that area rather than getting their action the crime stock before him so I believe in conjunction was the community that run there and the system is dated it stores it for three weeks so I think it 's a total package that we need to address as part of long to implant so I 'd vote against this resolution at this time take it on job on or what mr. Reid has said we do to that at night and it 's it 's that 's when the crimes not happening because they change we 're across although people still down the yeah the issue is in the night the issue is during the day is yep so I 've given some Walters doesn 't want to raise and last mr ridd there we got the World Health Organization accreditation one of those they look at as a thing and I 'm going to probably say the word wrong at sea cep te X is to do with having plantings around towns that help prevent crime now the recover there is particularly to photo street we 're trees that 's the one that aims towards vertical that area there when they come across from what 's the irish pub on the corner on that area so i believe the whole package needs to be redressed that 's the cousins who is human John how long how long is it the substrate how r is the distance for the cable to run so it 's running from spa spyros me judge you by cave on the 30 by ok but by kilometer are common L yeah yeah yeah nearly vertical arm is a long way so you ran in right away from spa Road right the way down here sponsorship another possibility as it became the settle now herb unison or so my mom made hackles I 'm sorry to cure just a question to mr. red and mrs. unbudgeted expenditure if it 's such a high crime area and it 's been in their show why is it why was it not in the plane we 've attempted to upgrade the solar power using solar power sort of cleared vegetation we we 've upgraded the batteries but it 's just not we 're still gonna drop out so we 've tried to limp along and yellow could limp along another one but long-term plan but there 's always that risk ler and knock on effect in terms of our image is what I 'm concerned about what sort of sinus do we have there at the moment for people when they not to leave the variables yep we 've got we 've got all that we 've also got signs saying you 're being watched by cct lures we have to label it and that doesn 't prevent those who you want to do things I mean I think counselor body makes a really good point that we need to look at the whole safer community project on what we 're doing in other areas as well I 'm I 'm reluctant to spend forty one thousand dollars as a piecemeal approach just to one piece if I can give you some comfort that we never work piece meal and we have got a strategy with our cities TV and in the draft Lantern plan there is a good renewal program for upgrading and renewing the cameras around sitting at CBD but in some ways this is not part of that picture you spell park was put in solely because of the crime that we got we were getting at least three campervans more stolen everywhere with the goods being taken and through front page articles about how the community had to step in to help them so council responded at that time to try and do a job to provoke that and therefore we work for the wireless solar-powered CCTV camera and we 've tried to make that work but it 's got to the point where it 's just not working k 3 g.r you 're thinking would take on board councillor bodies council John 's comment share with regarding efficiencies also command council body for his diligence only going out community patrols pitches before he on grants them will give a full time job the way I i I 've made precise supporters never going to be an achiever I believe it should be should be done and I 've like to second counselor Woodson my mood we let 's what is it okay thank you thank you if it 's yeah I sort of because I 've talked whole thing is actually getting to it mature level where the whole replacement might be needed shortly and I 'm wondering you know I think dance has got a got a point here and I just would love to hear from them from the organization as well as to I know you talk to him every day John and all that sort of thing but yeah my talking some he is near he he has always mentioned it 's a problem but he said so so so absolutely John see that the cameras I was a violent intimidation computed man whose places to tape it really structured yes yes they are like even a data that even in real life the bright side at least we were three weeks my clip from DVR when we replace them at the council but it arose about 2009 determine teams and manfully for the cameras in the first place ability remember there and this date three hours my from the PVR so we 're now are three weeks I 'm so weird to in a bit where you spin it off the more whole lot betta but they do need replacing renewing and operationally we need to keep on top of trimming trees and a little less sort of stuff although say sub T is all about about using vegetation and stuff to your advantage rather than just clear felling outside so there 's a balance that 's always going to be a balance and this though is is the CEO of cedars the camera actually came after that so that CBD project was about putting cameras in the CBD we didn 't had a continuation of people tourists getting the events indeed out and it was a negative luckily were getting stuff on social media was it 's coming another time with you new stuff all around the world that tap I was a horrible place to go because you you lose you hear when we go to a penetration in sweet ride this as we 've said it doesn 't work and this request so this item has come specifically from the organizers of the CCTV who organizer who set the mirror and I 'm meeting with you and myself and have heard from and they said to us then we said we could wait and we wait until the 10-year plan and all we could put something on now the request was please put something on now because all it will take will be one then we rubbed off when the cameras down because it 's not enough solar energy in our job here has been jeopardized he says papers in front of it oh and you wished in through the tutor state they don 't mean the negative publicity I mean a dollar value of this and how it made the trek from people want to come here just I think with us myself just want to know the move on the second yeah we ever there is some just thinking some external sponsorship they could be gathered from some with the thing accommodation providers people like that they 've seen all the crime stoppers about that or even just one with electric rotary club or something like that I know that my place but there yeah if possible 41 k his squad but from the late this is clean new exec you is parents see these things are getting related accessories you can oh can I just reinforce we have got a prawn okay we aren 't we haven 't seen is back where you won 't_''_678.509 until on turn plum what I 'm saying to you is that this is this has come from directory button from Roger who runs it runs the the volunteers there now if council chooses not to do it I also we 're saying is we 've got to risk here the solution is this if you decide that you don 't want to spend the money where that risk will still be there until if you decide to fund missed you in the long term I will do it then but we 've got a risk that as a all of the community as a risk in terms of yes people steering or breaking into vans etc so the soul of how has not been effective at the moment this is the solution to if you decide not to fund it the risk will have to sustain the risk if I onto implants at all it 'll take a couple of months up to gonna go shower will keep the resolution is this am it 's been moved by can cancel Williamson did you move it against the backs of all those in favor please say aye Iron Chef Hanlon booth oh yeah I

planets in that that sort of option debate area I was quite concerned about the program for Bali to a witch on the nineteenth and with i think was pretty successful in upgrade in that to a much higher level because the original comments were it was not going to be much development work done for the next 30 years and i didn 't_''_1278.08 i didn 't think that was very good at all so rather lifted it

    "text": "um zoom you 're now Chris Georgia Stan I just give you an overview de sculpture now get into the technicalities when a Chris cast is finished and the Talpiot Scott trust is incredibly excited to be taking a sculpture designed by a local seeking school student to completion and I don 't know video we 're but in 2013 the trust conducted there and uncle skills sculpture competition and it was for year 11 students to enter to local schools totally a tiered college and tongariro participated the competition was made possible thanks to sponsorship Ventura up a key and other local businesses the object of the competition was to encourage students and their appreciation and understanding of the importance of art and culture within our community our hope was to find a design of originality and excellence it could be taken to full scale construction we also aimed to inspire the youth of our town bringing art and culture to the community through an incredibly careful selection process the trust choice tap Honoria tier student t sourav sculpture butterfly should be designed and engineered for installation and a our criteria that was contemporary robust low maintenance topical and visually outstanding butterfly will set perfectly in the South the main site which leads to the circular garden area and over three meters high with a wingspan of 1.7 meters the sculpture with orange wings and a black body hovering on a metallic silver pole will be a reminder that the number of moderate butterflies has red lead runner shape that is your opinion of the trust that this work will attract national attention as far as we are aware no other time is producing works by secretly schools for public spaces the trust is proud to recommend this communal scope to opportunity to counsel and hope to realize our dream we request that in keeping with the Talpiot District Council outs arts grant that we be given fifty percent of the cost of butterfly being 3081 dollars including GST we hope that the tackle district council a process submission and supports us and are givers to encourage wild appreciation and understanding of the significance of agriculture in our society a vibrant and interesting environment as what we strive for I 'm happy to answer them question actually would like to move it and I was thinking just before you do I tariff occations gym and regards of the cost that we 've got before us I understand the 26 us just had there 's also in regard to this project pair at a cost of 1,500 which were no debt would be on our shoulders who should the resolution drag you better say something yeah the intent we 're doing some work in the salamander on the lights anyway so we were going to include that as that is part of that that contrast so that 's why I 've told you about it but I 've kept it out of those costs because we 're already included elsewhere in another budget again that specifically towards that sculptures the 1500 so we would we be saying it 's part alone no mine cause by 1500 before we do another project so that you were doing at one off and we 're doing as part of the other day you wish be honest let 's just make a comment thank very impressive technology innovation button up the local ecology and system this instance a very good opportunity for local gang tells young listen to demonstrate the yard where yeah quite various now young people doing with my casa johns all those in favor say aye take team on this one um any only because provoking with one of first times the last a while since I 've got damaged I 'd love to say that it 's a procedural item and it was take it as read but I do understand that is for the discussion around that so so we look forward to the questions but essentially I guess the important perhaps out of this item is that we ask gift in that the original resolution that you passed which had the bike being mended by a local artist be revoked and that that the resolution be replaced with what we 've suggested there the net result of that or the end result of that would be that the bike would be repaired by the original artist which is desire of the community a loose community group I use some since its inception and I guess most importantly for you that the net cost to the ratepayer will be no different what it would have been under your previous resolution which was the approximately two-and-a-half thousand dollars so and it cost ratepayers the same and the community group who 've been involved with us will be fundraising for the remainder in order to meet the desired outcome which is for the artist to to repeat the bike um there is one update from what 's in the item and that the MOU that some text has been updated u13 has got a copy of that which she 'll hand out now and well Crosby who 's been involved in drafting that is present and can answer any questions regarding that specific we getting the memorandum now and there 's literally counselor because it 's it 's hot off the press that 's not the point mr. chairman so the the memorandum has been circulated to you as a sort of presets and as has been suggested to us by the by the opponent softer like many as I say you wish anyone on and maybe a suggestion when you worship and that other changes their significant muster gospel is here so maybe if he was to walk you through those changes that might just assist in your Noreen human growth clarification is it not a fact that if new things would be to be put on the agenda if I wanted a resolution on the agenda at the table that X number of working days pride their gender coming out in this case we have a document that I 'm not prepared to save five minutes of reading whether I agree or not I believe it 's at once again another breach and procedure nice little bridge meant in the same way that other things going to mendel it council meetings it 's just making sure that you guys have comfort in terms of what you doing so if you 've been able to make a decision because of the timing beside that takes some time to get that comfort or discuss that with the chair about how you proceed I would believe that the item needs to fury look at the the original one some of the some of the language might be likely different but essentially the changes um to if we go through it background be we put the name of the artist as opposed to forge at and paragraph one is pretty much the same just with some slight wording changes um and being more specific and putting the artist name in there for instance paragraph the old paragraph two now becomes paragraph three about confidentiality and there 's a new paragraph 2 which makes it clear that once the bike is returned an ownership of a physical structure and copyright beast in the council and with the artist being recognized as the author of the work and a couple of provisions of the copyright out what that what that means is that if we ever have photos of it put up on a publication we have to say this was an artwork by this person so it just means that you have to you 're obliged to recognize the artist when you use images of the sculpture and paragraph 4 is the same as and is is the main method that 's been amended I 'll come back to that in a sec um there 's being a dispute resolution clause added in paragraph six which is a standard dispute resolution clause allowing for negotiation and then a mediation I mean paragraph seven is exactly the same as essentially as the old paragraph five the only change being in 7.2 and where previously said the memory and themselves terminate on the request of both parties that more appropriately says terminate only with the agreement of both bodies so the as I said the only apart from naming changes the only real two amendments to what was attached to the agenda are the clarification about what happens to ownership and copyright ownership of the physical item and copyright that parrot that paragraph 2 and changes to thee and what happens if the bike is further vandalized and as Gath has pointed out this document although and if you like written by me is what was firstly written by John and then modified by me is what the artist and the loose group that but I and it 's obviously for the council to decide whether it agrees with those and what I just point out in paragraph five is an obligation on the council to if there is damage the council under this document would be obliged to repair have the bike repaired it would be obliged to use the artist however if the cost of the repair work was going to exceed half the insurance value and then the council could decide simply not to repair through the cheer thank you Rob couple of quick questions for you regarding the MOU um has the artist seen this mou my understanding okay because I would be very interested to know whether they 're happy with that mo you sure figure enough he 's what I what I would add to that is that I 'm the one of the proponents of the bike locally as a retired engineer who has informed us in US but he has informed us that he 's been in discussion was with the artist and in representing his interests and they certainly been the approach that that he 's taken says on the return of the repair giant by to excite would you clarify to incite does that mean top o or does it mean aside where it was previously cited and this papers written on the understanding that the bike man returned to its original sites at the top of the control goes hill and that 's the best the basis of that there is some discussion within the group about whether it 's peace the year or somewhere else if it was going to be somewhere else then we would need to obviously bring that back to council at some stage in the future at this point it 's it 's it 's original site will be decided so there 's no reason why the wording building consent on 13 bar 3 is included in the agenda duck the reason I put that in there was because I would just highlight in the May the required for building consent I saw them oh yeah and pick just a couple of points of clarification the two and a half thousand mentioned and the resolution is that faster inclusive of right okay and secondly and is nothing in this email you about such and i would i would like that in there so it needs to be a specific decision of counsel at the stages a the only decision net that you 've got is that the bike go back to its original location because that 's the site that you 've approved yeah def at some stage in the future you wanted to to consider changing it or someone who wanted to change that there would be a specific item that would be brought to you with alternatives and we don 't have any information or knowledge all that at this stage so yeah the basis that we 're working on is that the bike will go back to that original site and as i say if that was to change would bring their back to you in the future right and this to a fish mainly the estimated insurance value of the back is six thousand dollars right so 5.4 and you know if the FF the bike were too unfortunately be damaged or vandalized again and and 's finally nice to put a face to the name and which provide a quote for the bucket exceeded 30,000 and in its apt to westward gets fixed or not oh yes that does this email even say if he was damaged or vandalism and it was under half it and estimation insurance fairly did the bike could thing to speak automatically effects between our arrangement with operations in the artist to clarify through the chair I think we have an insurance he exists for that 25k so we 'd be ad no second just reach in the fedor 60 that 's insurance value of the excess as 20 pattern so it a big sale around 30 ingrained if it 's anything under that amount in it it would not have to come no so so through through you the chair with the way it 's drafted at the moment what it means is we have an insurance value not at present of approximately sixty thousand dollars that 's what it 's our book says the way this is drafted is that if it were to cost a needle thirty it repaired by marcel right Marcel would provide us with a quote if the quote comes up to thirty thousand dollars councils obliged to have it repaired if the quote is over thirty thousand dollars the council could choose not to have it repaired insurance is a separate I can see the Ender between that this is where else am I we are trained from in the first place with the bat is known for back for the right pair and although these things and some issues along the way this is mainly the consensus from ratepayers is that we do the best buy them especially when it comes to and budget expenditures so I 'm just trying to get a full picture since we 've had this for that five minutes so you smell you 're running until it 's rob just explained efforts fergie is damaged in a in god forbid god forbid in the quote from ourselves so that under the MOU would we 'd have to go to myself the quote aimin at 30,000 or under then we would be obliged to focus attend to have make the decision whether or not you fix the bike or you don 't as I was then eight you will just your discretion and if you decide to fix the bike you still have to go to Marcel under this agreement and that 's that 's a that 's a that 's the case anyway so we got to last time by going to another engineer you wouldn 't be in that situation that 's on the basis of the speed being a piece of art this is sculpture and likewise if one of our other pieces say the Scopes the cloak of tier by the great lake center if they was damaged we 'd go back to the original artists to get a review you know it move at this stage that we 're doing the meeting for 15 minutes I just wanted to ask one question you wish it another question if I may I 'm particularly to do with my item five on this no you and we gotta say it we got the same statements conditions with regards to our other artwork in the town 'm just concerned that about item five that 's all yeah we 've with go long-standing MoU with the with the scope with the Scottish trust and whichever they come under the scope trust and this has been issue so because with the sculpture trust we don 't we haven 't had the same issues because we 've got an MoU which we all know where we stand with it then with this one and this is the whole idea of those has to get Garrity just that mieu with the sculpture trust does it allow the artists the same as what we are going to well perhaps might assess if I read out the provision in this and now we have a you back in 2010 there was a email there 's Nemo you cover the sculptor trust and the sculptor trust the reference under maintenance repairs the council may from time to time carry out miss he reappears cleaning maintenance and repair the Trust 's shall have appropriate be given the opportunity to request the artist to carry out any repairs or maintenance many sculptor that is commissioned engage by way of separate written agreement the artist for any such repairs or maintenance as appropriate the trust will provide counsel any instructions it receives from an artist for the ongoing maintenance of any sculpture that is commissioned under this memorandum so that 's that 's slightly different to what this is same as them yes so as it is different why was that not put in the document we 're reading at the moment as a guide as as as I so as I said although I now understand that myself um hasn 't seen this document this the words that why that are in this document were words provided by the representative of the group of the funding group who said to us that they were lazing with the funding group end with the artist so we assumed that that was okay so these are this is their requirements that 's not what was drafted by by us or would necessarily be recommended by us it 's just what they what they 're asking for and we 're putting it before the council this appellant sorry mr. advocate yeah I feel like I 'm standing in the building with everything crashing around around asterisks completeness I 'm sorry my cell i have met young saying i was going to stand here and bleep the council about how the communication has been shopping to you ence the engineer in fact is the whole communication has been a total cluster stuff up I 'm up here to make a decision on this today I think this agenda item needs to be deferred you move old chick I 've moved that this item mr. food I 'll see my right speak sorry to tell you I 'm just through the cheer councillor cousins can you explain why you think it needs to be deferred I 'm just in the interest of getting decisions made and moving foot it 's like I understand your rationale for why yes I want to with resolve for the community soon as soon as we can but if we 're going to tell me why we just understood before that the mr. called spree has some information for us regards to the bike you want _''_1469.63 information the ownership all due respect my cell remains unclear the copyright remains unclear we 're asked us on a document here which we haven 't had a chance chance to read we need to clear the ground zero and start again otherwise all we 're doing is moving to miss out of the way in to have a mess and there 's so many things in the background that have not been addressed which I think from a governance point of view at a democratic point of view we need to sort as well because we 're here for the community and I 'm principal and the masking my counselors to act on principle here that 's really what i have to say mr. my comics are that we 're here is governance I would be concerned that to do proper governance we may be looking at unforeseen costs further down the track to do with this particular issue with respect I you know I get there I 'm not to see I 've not really it went into the blame game side of it and I take pick resolution of bursting with rather see a tree consoled immediately rel them to Thurid I mean I I know that 's an Underwood with regard ownership someone 's going to correct me if I 'm wrong with referee guardianship it 's not necessary my personal view but this in sculpture wasn 't done under the auspice of a sculptor trust so ownership is really saying is greatness own ownership is very unclear so there is an argument to suggest it that the ownership is within the artist still data domain not counsel so we knew this the resolve it yeah I think though well I hope more of the same mind that we would really like to see this bike repaired in in the site where it was as soon as possible but I 've gotta confess I 've got some issues with this in front of us today I think it 's different to perhaps the standard meu for the sculpture trust I appreciate what to Castle bodies just said regarding future costs of of this and unless we get those clearly defined and sorted it might have to to do with it pretty quickly I don 't want to delay it and meet at the end of October for the same similar meeting if we 're going to delay it can we please of an agenda item for a special meeting so that we can actually make a decision on this once and for all can I just fear the table if we do decide to defer it and respect to the artist I would like to know that he has had me to sign the MOU that we are going to agree to as well because there will be a guarantee that like we 'll come back if my cells not happy with it and we have to enter into some further discussions because he 's not happy with this draft then we 're back at square one and our cluster whatever will be even bigger than it currently is so weary table it I want to know that Marcel is happy with the email you that we have been asked as well and I also concur with and he runs comments particularly the deputy mere and would want the right Beck we want we want it sorted but there are a few things in here which you know with 15 between that sort of knowledge on just kept of concerns about that I 've like and legal opinion on and I know that there can 't_''_1697.749 be done in the public arena and and myself no disrespect you and I 've don 't want to string you along whether will I do with this than speedily as well but I believe we do need to do it properly this time so that we don 't end up coming back to this again I hope that 's okay with you as well yeah it 's probably the best most sensible option going forward is to fair enough so we can get a good understanding the scene by you make sure you 'll help you this as well Marcel and make sure yeah I 'm the happy event of obviously got some queries on it ourselves so the deferral i think has been moved and yeah in your worship there we 've already got a special ordinary council item can we not just it died also six myself you worship especially only problem is and if we if we defer it yes that gives myself we understood that this was a document that Marcel was happy was happy about I understand we have a resolution in front of us we are going to be turn be diplomatic and well so sorry so quickly can I just can I just finish if we 're going to bring some comments about legal advice and I think it 's quite right that the council should get some legal advice about this um however if we simply defer it back to a public meeting we can 't I can 't give you any legal advice anyway on the other hand i can give you legal advice now if that 's what you wish it won 't resolve the position for Marcel but we 're always going to be in that situation that is going to need to be some backwards and forwards about final arrangements anyway and the council with respect can decide on a what beer bottle liners and then authorize chair but with respect mr. gold three what we 're trying to do is get the bike back and if we approve and rescind resolution that frankly I 'm not keen to rescind and there 's no guarantee that we 're going to get the bike back that 's why I think Marcel needs to be happy with next that will help inform our decision and for me it 's not so much of a legal issue it 's about whether the conditions that we 've been in polk we 're agreeing on pariksit people to the artists possession well now so another fish business eeveelution yeah what it made us feel that happy to defer it so you moved and seconded I think so it can consume this we take what Rob said here and bring try and bring it back to that 15 luton you wish it does that cover off Rob 's advice just thing about him giving us legal advice which would need to be done in confidence in copper in confidence that 's not on the intro session even though it 's not on the we get some advice and confidence if Marcel 's happy to give some time we can just put this agenda item later in the day no longer it 's too much just it 's been moved and seconded to ferret 15 octobre and we 'll do it then and I think in the mentor so if we 've got any queries on this can we can we get that 15th meeting trying to make those changes in you wish it what what I would anticipate happening between now and the 15th is an odd suggest that the method needs to be he starts off in the confidential part of the meeting there will be further discussions with Marcel to make sure that whatever is being placed before the council is what he is asking for as I said my understanding was that the document that you 've now got is what he was asking for but that clearly is in the case um and then I would anticipate giving the council legal advice about that document which you could then make a decision about the confidential shixin of that meeting is going to be the repair of the bike the 37th of May a resolution unanimous he was passed on this chamber to carry out certain course of action and I 'm concerned about the reading on 13 bar for 13 bar 5 where it states it would appear that a solution is now at hand the solution was at hand were 27th of may we have a look at the other page it says as a reinstatement has been a romantic process due to ignorance of parties disagreement with councils original decision so what the community disagree all the time with council decisions I don 't know who wrote that but it 's not a fair representation of the reason we 're debating this issue at the moment if the bike had not left the confines of council myself and ourselves would probably not be sitting here now and I think the point is to make very strongly moved and seconded Carol all those in favor please say aye aye as against Kerry item number four _"

    "text": "information remove the question just be sickened by cosmic dogs all those in favor please say aye I us to carry item number seven I like to see back ok ok I just take the report is read and if you 've got any questions or um where is a layout I 'll do what I can a couple of questions as I asked previously why is this path why are we going through this process now should does not be part of an overall rating process through the cheer this was a recommendation made by the community board as such counsel can adopt the recommendation as a resolution where I can refer back to the community board for further consideration what we 're doing here because the recommendation from the PT PG was fed up and bulk and included only recommendation we thought it was appropriate to brief the council on facts related to the valuation I 'm hints the attachment repairs the valley regionals ordered opinion etc and Tony 's here to answer any concern to that particular nature so it relates back to the recommendation that was except that when I read through the item and I look at seven x 3 + option to paragraph there where we talk about lateness RG would take for them to 16 revaluation within the defined rating area but to me it could have potential death that should apply throughout that criteria should apply through all the revaluation throughout the district not just to data pad of the district a large at the river therefore it raises the question for me whether in fact there should be part and parcel of the overall rating system and revelatory valuation and whether in fact we should go back to that community board and say yes we will look at it but we will look at that in combination in combination with the long-term plan your suggestions um three mr. chief um most of us though some of them that it 's done as the motor of course through the local government waiting act and that probably what are the loops they have to go through to pass the orbit probably supersedes those things over in some cases and that we have been no that wasn 't a design of the script that really will really upset and so they look at that bird I don 't end with the letter audit process I don 't know whether they need to go that far the only reason why I asked it is that will be in inverted Lee or unwittingly set a dangerous precedent by doing a tiff or more so to F or doing this on its own and then other groups later on come along and all this early good point you 're good point and really what we 're saying here though is that an N and I and and management will talk with slowness and just crossed it took these things off and just as a matter of course for that for the good bit of ways the questions hmm so it 's part of the annual review yes yes the same concerns as councillor Bennett I just feel sir our district properties should be reevaluated on the same procedures and not if not have a separate little section that 's dealt with differently yes so my concern is the Riverside to any properties if it 's dis required and I 've got no problem with it then XO for the same screen earned it you know I think about that um the woman who started all this in Sudan he was really about the methodology of the way they were treated on these things to do with could you have to have tender process that we can 't get involved with because it 's laid down by evaluation failure general so nothing was about how man mass actually got by the way they treated people they weren 't taking the right statistics I don 't think the girls were thinking about it as should only centric um I don 't send it back to tongue in the community ball is going to be the right thing just here to change what 's on here to make it everyone I don 't think we 're going to be able to change the world but this one early really doubt about the way they pitched did things yes yeah yes so some people do know what Leroy I 'm not the value is hid with individuals I I can 't say whether or not and we were at that meeting and too many and I don 't okay my perception was it was were they rude how do I think he came across as being arrogant but he was only defensive because year before he was waiting for it to be yeah and I suppose full of older people obscene is moving in major investment just their house do you know you yes sir s 'why yeah i think that figures for a real estate point of view we 're in line with property sales yeah so so but basically what we 've ended up with as a group of um owners who are unhappy with the evaluation who joined a group um and by suggested to us that we should do these from a to if to appease them really and we 're saying that okay we 're happy to do that and I 'm Chandler and we hit the week with loneliness and make sure that group and if we deal with it but if you think that year is audited by the office of the venue a genial which has loaned information New Zealand to get to try and put a little from like this and make big picture a sort of but but then to say we 're not going to do it other ads prefer to say to that group okay we 've listened we 've taken to on board what your seed and we 'll try our best to make sure next time you will help parameter and that could be pad after year he waved review or their evaluation is part of that will get no mess to work with you guys and individually and we 'll start start on the right foot we 've done it before where in the past we 've had objections from and the forestry sector and so what we 've done since 2005 from the arts it we 've talked to them and you know started off on the right foot so with this group who have and stood up this time we 'll do it if you okay with it yeah I just going to make the graph shows that scored four point three to four point five top marks are five you know to have a system like the real evaluation and come out with an average of four point four I think that 's pretty good personally and you know I think most property owners were a little bit disappointed in the new evaluation I certainly was and and I went to the expense of getting my own valuation done I registered value it that 's the opportunity you can take if you wished it so I 'm more importantly more important to me to keep whatever revaluation in 2060 as a district revaluation and not as something other than another group having special little arrangement um that 's just an adjuster to get to clarify Tony there the request by this this group are actually nothing is nothing really different from what they normally do for other residents anyway and this seems to be more of discussion of the relationship between land mass and these residents and I don 't think it 's appropriate as a council resolution really tell you honest I and work with those people when it comes ice together because we talk about being dealt with differently yeah they 're actually things that they were doing anyway fully and for themselves of the economic development will they do there that 's my heart of the order no we 're not out there not asking for anything different that we treat they feel have been treated and well it 's a relationship professional he 's not a rating issue i feel ya so it sort of came about to end up in here because it went because of it went to the board and there is no strangers here yeah you know I suppose we can amend it to make it a district-wide thing or we amend the resolution just to say that I think this is a relationship issue so maybe it 's just when when it comes around next time that we will work more closely to help facilitate the relationship between those aggrieved residents and land mess is in our role as a council but I don 't think we can do more than that limsa yes of sitting with councillor burners logic regarding priests and whether if she were getting involved yet were they going to open the link to the whole to stricken certainly with risks counselor rosine this data this is poor relation personal thing is not rest with the personnel within the lame s and instead i think cancer cousins say that probably work to the did reflect like those would reflect the valuation pretty well yeah yeah you 're the melon squat yeah originally the group wanted us together what you think so wonderfully what you 're going to do a hill I didn 't have a response notification I was not anything here through youtube I was not at the August board meeting down there but I notice in the document before us at States a recommendation from the board was and there 's a tech it is an effect in the first one if is dad for this and the following resolution that is there a reason to that right the original resolution dilution time the caps from the TCB more data to create record of the resolution is a on KGC number 7 11 a car van include point A to E in the in the document next time there 's no easier jobs include yeah it must be a mistake one of them is a fine inspected the second question mr. chairman if I read it it 's on page hidden bar to utilizing market evidence in the midst of property inspections property inspections for both sold and non sold properties produces evaluation that reflects a fair market price how many physical visits were done on both sold and non sold properties um all so properties kick it um opposite and there 's the auditors ensure someone 's ensure that the appropriate amount of properties are visited both sold and unsold that 's part of the audit process and the odor that audit report on here says I think it 's synthetic what oh yeah when I rich when I read the valuation airy for you to see how have another whitewash but I 'm going to be incorrect on there it just seemed to be from the eight zation in the community about what happened with the what I 've actually reading that just suggest something I 'm gonna throw something out here just to see if we can sort of help things more the wrong I personally don 't see a necessarily a big issue with the resolution as it stands the key is that if staff go away and have a discussion with the with lung mass technology and ultimately decide that this group should be treated differently and that is an issue that council needs to be certainly aware of and involved with any decision-making process however if staff come back and advise counselors that this group will be dealt with exactly the same as every other group then the issue is sort of an irrelevance so rather than trying to mend the resolution which has come to you from community board it may well be worth accepting that resolution however adding your own portion to the resolution which you 're entitled to do which you can then also return to the community board for their information which is that if there is any decision made that changes the district wide approach and then by a council or something similar on those lines perhaps something with a bit more we could table it at the stage it 'll be invisible I 've moved at the table the resolution before us and they would recommend an additional resolution to be incorporated at the same time so part 1 and part 2 that if anything if there was anything any little district right approach as a result of Blackcomb conversation it will be built back to Council and traitors of the long-term plan better and I just need to take some advice across the table see if we can do that through the cheer naturally we don 't sit on your hands we have had numerous discussions with lameness and regards to this and we have got to a fairly common state of mind as far as the valuation issues within the whole district using this as one of the catalysts will that discussion so we do have a degree of confidence that heading into 2016 that we 're all on the same page and certain aspects will be tightened up but from a process perspective had to be addressed in the appropriate fashion as I say we haven 't just SAT around doing nothing okay three I just wanted to say that witness came to the community board and the group came to the community board with this and that the board felt it was best to come up to council because it needed to be dealt with between land mass and council it wasn 't between Lee and mess and aboard so that 's why it was needed to come up to counsel and we 're being watched by one of the ladies on webcam she sees them can I please explain to you the EMS use and consistent data and an adequate economic analysis and we go through the chair and regards to that that is why i asked the value of general to do a audit of the objections and respect of the valuations and you 've got a copy of you 've received previously your copy of that audit report and there was nothing in that audit report which matches the comments that you just made sorry I 'm gonna say so we threw the chair I think Rob Williams suggestion and the interest of moving this along following process and meeting the community water needs we do with have the amendment as it stands with the rider about the long-term plan and so just a reason just a recap part one is the resolution as you see before two will be that if any approach is agreed to that is different to a district-wide consistent standard than the matter will be brought to counsel for decisions to be made via the long-term plan thank you again see you then I can 't_''_1066.08 be moved by Councillor message on my promise to say I really _"

talk to you later anchor anchor wire okay so I each we do you suggest we please thank you very much Ariel and floor is yours and I won 't go through the paperwork when you 're a geek like a psychic and it is really opportunity Castle typically their community before you start saying so and I just want to make sure that you ever feel it so what they also raised it it doesn 't take away any choices it cancels like what when you get to thank you every Kingdom evolve giving along with colleges so that whatever the TV people I represent of a wife or so and I just like to take you through evenings and we obviously kid places and we 've been working on I last three or four weeks and terms of who we going to join this eating show and so i 'll come at you guys about this later that will be really great with mini else 's as we obviously met with 're presenting till these organizations and whatever okay so you 'd like capsules support I quite well trying to come along to these organizations justice we look three misdemeanors them the size that we would likely to this is your plan you need to own it and drive it so to be really honest we would like to have at least a couple and counselors at each and every one of those meetings Jimmy let 's get some clarification in as we as a council if not recited what options we 're going to take for the 10-year plan are we having these meetings for Senior Council staff to say what we 're thinking or should these groups be being addressed by councillors what 's what format will this discussion take i mean i 've emailed area with my concerns about the tell fund and about then barely careful really not been included and I 've got some real reservations about some of this which is so blank and depth there is nothing for the general public can we work on but I need to know the format how 's go along and say this is what we 're thinking what do you think to the community because if you first meeting by this is on Monday no one would have got my monday will go through hell sorry you 're just a these are the things that we have decided initial stages this has been been through workshops yeah this is what would come out of the paint oh so this is what we have decided collectively as a unit so we have decided this the initial part but it does not assign some concrete going forward or whatever but this is what the initial part cancels wanted to be a constant so this is a council and I understand the reason I raised it was to me when you go to this document for instance i took a cup of councils before about it we got this notion great lake taupo with 400 million to our area tourism that ain 't come from destination great lake taupo so we 've also as I explained in my email to you in regards of the fact that the X has for that elderly it 's no longer a core service of council but this publication doesn 't point out what these changes me what we can and can 't do give me I would rate I 'll rephrase that not the support from the community it might be a hundred percent support for a particular action as counsel to take this country to the changes in the act Sophie to fill in one major thing that 's on this document is being decided by government that it 's no longer a cool service the counselor at the beans Eden here to complete a statement made of it event particularly in regards one of the things that 's on that piece of paper so I guess just to reiterate what has been said and they said very well my side but the housing for the elderly despite what an MP might of receipt or might not have said long as prisoner believe it is up to you and your community to decide what you as a council do so you have decided through your workshops that you are going to go we be into housing for the elderly it 's then up to the community to respond to that and then ultimately it 's up to you of the next stage to make a decision which will then go into a draft and enable another set of submission so this is right at the start end of the process and remember we talked about hot potatoes yeah these are the things that potentially the community may have a really strong view on one way or the other this options debate is a nice safe place that people can give you this their feedback in the views so then you can have that debate with knowledge of what the people think going into the draft long-term plan so it 's about information given and I guess coming back to your earlier question about these meetings and we will fight you to go and tell how you are going to run those well here you want to run those meetings but again it 's about information sharing us about getting information remember this early options debate isn 't about submissions and for hearings the community you need to finish my point that I made earlier you need to be there to hear that because as you guys that will be taking what the community are said in having that debate on their discussion around this table about what you couldn 't so in terms of the meetings how are you conversation rather than and what we are other team members in lugano ultra and inside it is we will have information to people and would have been seen people think not and I think what God is doing what about you to try to resolve because much more trying to do this and in what the counselors there is a bit about the community and hearing all the same to you I think we should be lots of food so it 's very important you know in social situations where I hear a presentation it will be based on my face it that 's the conversation might come back to my people something else they come up if we haven 't conclusion Castle Park and yeah I was dumb but really I see given as i attended was dead and elected noon does rolled and our teepee in that 's exactly right she liked it it 's not defined what our actual activities are and i 'm pretty sure from the workshops we had that we 've all decided then although the housing for the elderly each did a theory mine a number of residents in the district is extremely sensitive an emotional issue and it was something that we should definitely be heavy conversation about and regarding but and the detail here respected and that worried about the security and I sort of took it a bit different that its overall tourism so again if we can all get out there and explain it probably would help and with the rate squeaked I thought and the conceits as counsel Jones had a brilliant idea about to around about the philosophy around affordability and reducing deep it so I think it 's a much sort of to order a nicer way to go out about a number of things that she put include some of this two subjects of your so yeah I 40 minutes it is it is quite different options debate compete to going out of your draft LTZ and whatnot and I have a number of committees that meat over a month so if we can keep existing strip copies so you can take them along to inform those groups as well just to edge to this cabinet and do we just be thank you individually about what we can help us yeah I 've seen the absolutist right there 's nothing on the fittest of Taylor please it 's like they find me to take solutions we do a lot of things I most people we get to I just go to Howard so for ant can write pages with us thousands of paphos don 't have those hepatoma and I 'm going to be getting a postcard there 's never a reason to the h1 very expensive to current students are girls and copies it wasn 't_''_1474.63 a post it to people and also to you will notice these online christie option we 're really trying to people online be measured there 's a couple of reasons to things like them so it makes analysis of the information theory you 're incorrect get to the places to find the spell also all the postcard again we also people if you don 't we 'll be up on the website obviously it 's going into the total times the size so it 's true peace it 's also going in the entity advisor we obviously MTG multiple community groups including England he will be the series and wandering around street in these posters up and be news in a library offices me that I talked about in these also new engagement so ever squatched a lot more if you clench Archimedes yeah very tiny bit me for us as we will bring us making like another comedy or you 've done a lot of work i 'm just reading through the groups or reading through the meeting eight and I want to attend as many as I can it seems to be two individual groups rather than individual members of the public experience a good venue was be the coffee mornings to the library we get involved in those students also an ideal place which I mentioned before is the weekend market wake up on you in even to Atkins wish your market into the visa obviously is eros it will be in the focus on saving this we the Me 's coffee tin cans and I need people to you wish mr. rotor else would be good venue for a local public meeting will combine or compile combined prettiest for an X region are you offering it free your mother 's on the other television yeah sorry i forgot to mention it facebook has been utilized as well to promote that message yet will be tweeting like crazy i guess okay thanks oh and yeah and our side yep a few minor changes to the front page i wanted to bring to your attention i 'm under there and look quite rare talks about reducing DD at the end of the sentence i just wanted to broach and legislation and near so it would read upgrades for drinking water and wastewater to make legislation and consent requirements sorry and it is just going to be a little bit so that we can fit the logo on and the right hand and bottom corner just such a bit more prominent we 've also created a team we 're playing email address i 'll be getting it to this as well last time you had it favored like this said how many did you get actually physical pamphlets back Harry pamphlets we got back but we got four over four hundred responses and tip in total why do we still like them to the back 2008 offers the last time I saw reviews and mobile portal tap screen oh no we don 't hit those anymore yeah the people sort of you know stand on service fee appended Misha and we did it slightly different through when we did the L neighborhood expo as well so we had the opinion meter but we also use laptops on the street and we yeah I was just going to say we could probably do it and 2008 didn 't wear that great because the Wi-Fi was pretty poor thing so I might be a bit more you know useful no Haitian people to save time money and people are playing them tween so absolutely never sell feel impressed okay I would justify concern again about the community engagement and I believe one way around it is to take off the names of the groups for instance on the fifteenth it 's lake taupo tourism Sun court why doesn 't just say sand court 5 30 feet when we go into an igmp how 's he going to capture all right what happened when they did a survey how many members do they get completeness all that just from one bit with n times that to happen to already existing again we 're not going to take all right you don 't have to seek thing out you just can walk in do your thing in and talk to the people is a very and low cost of easy way to exist or it eats a serious so effectively you wish upon the limits when we meet with the friends of the library who are just going to turn up well I figure is the opportunity have you got some other groups or you want a public meeting with a sandwich board on each side or I walk down the main street of the sandwich core don 't think I like be wrong with a much more in the bed I don 't think the option you have a say on scene today to say well anything more you know look at doing anything so i think my advice suggestions for instance the one to do with them typo resonance group or the Fievel over of acacia bay it should be a public meeting part of democracy is not talking to the people a mom and priests we 're also having night meetings which is great to see the markets and excellent ideas you said earlier oh definitely Adam those new mural coffee meetings in the week in markets um can go from you I think you 'll probably find the average attendance of public means and pass feel pretty light yes very liked it a lot haha we need to go to them okay election booths on Election Day yeah I go to the celt starts to the side good idea gasser but should they be four hundred and 20 year 2014 15 years 402 Oh chase develop and also under the rubbish one just before the choice had it sees them the last sentence we could we could provide wheelie bins but they will also come at a cost don 't we currently provide waiting rebels no because I 'm just thinking if you come to the yeast no part I just thought that last sentence was a bit so you do you could like is it part of the useful than I unless there was a some lines to say you saw one really burn off generally if people know that we pay for yeah that 's right you can use some moment we don 't get any information there I pay for the wheelie bins oh and I cancel room some erosion sorry I am would rather just put something on the news letters because the cost of doing it is probably quite significant and then also to about a keynote just allows us to sort of push the message in terms of using the online option on the williamson this i 'll just play pick-up castle Darius Boyd regarding the GLT with the that scene is very real tourism at rivers for a million goes to the economy and the context should be aware at work just a local economy but the papas leading diversey Ariel New Zealand 's economy shall be my boss specific to be more relevant to what he wanted using the 400 well as I would go through the tube that might sound recording in is through our district and these consumers announced because I think remember that mail your contribution of tourism some like 25 billion then to the national coney so if you want to put a quote in the night that you could or you can you just a lien oh right local before the words only Michael bleep before economy for local google yeah and the appellate counsel billet just a purely practical and request is that a lot of that will particularly when you printed in the newspaper you have a lot of small tight game and and when you print it on the newspaper if there 's any is going to be very very hard to see particular our elderly yes I am despairing in mind that this is that a full version so it will be it will be printed up to that I I agree they will they will there 's one of the challenges with with newspaper printed so it 's not great quality paper as we will know em but it 's it 's also about cost effectiveness in reaching as much of an audience as we can so that 's why we need to use the newspaper Lisa 's listening in ten severe that we needa hi Riz I think that 's you 've got the hold up the newspaper lose him yeah I the top I time sites and that 's their yeah yeah so there we go with it yeah okay I don 't yell a three patients the tumor they 're happy nalli room I 'm sorry about this we get down to the library and we 've got a yes or no and would you charge should we charge the higher books and use computers at the library yes percent the funding of the library comes from rates so we put into the cost of 700,000 to run the library people maybe more keen to take yes and pay two dollars for the horridge of a book that 's when we get about the facts you give people to make make decisions as important I don 't believe in some of these areas rectly doing me i 'm headed to put some additional figures in the library wanna finish yeah that 'd been encyclopedia though I 'm sure feel you saw one at short and sharp people actually read it boom they don 't want to read a whole encyclopedia in the history of the mighty event that tab absolutely no I think I 'm welding and trace one of the challenges that we hear a lot hello the content on there you just got enough okay but um yeah okay that 's the cousins yeah it 's right yours this to do clarification take for example of the DT LT it 's about whether that we spend the same more or less rather than a kiss or we at from accountant is what i 'm going to do with the information when i get it back so I mean summons that 's because people are used to know like to the community about the 3g LTE in advance we were asking about whether she was sending more or less was there a reason why you did a more or less or the same yes no answer no sir we did that was based on the feedback that we hear from the workshops which was my understanding was that there was the direction that the council 's wish to take rather for the yeast or thighs particular land yeah I think about it differently I think it captures it quite well a lot of people want some people miss spit some people want more or something off quite happy with how it 's all going so this is just the first is that we 're we 're going to add 400 ml into our local economy because there 's been a lot of discussion on that last sort of sentence is that really necessary because what we talking about castle and we 're asking the question do you want the same level do you want more or do you want less does it really matter what they bring into the community I don 't think it does I think it 's good to highlight their 400 on organizational you know share conduit sorry cam body yeah well rather show though we 're so deep in this community and they have heard of it and they apart and they 're funded by us so I think that you know four hundred million dollars is quite a significant amount of money yeah the eggman could be they go is it still there is a story i 'll be over in may not be no public will say oh yeah that is a there is a lot of money in Middle East and right through them but yeah I don 't think anyone 's gonna say all that comes directly from them so I think the public and dessert will deserve to know it 's a significant here it 's been ok do we have a program of engaging um you slip the dates ordered so just yet ok it 's been moved by Councillor pack all the amendments taken dear ended by cancer Stuart thank you very much all those in favor please say aye aye is against carried item number team _"

    "text": "like good afternoon mr. girl you worshiping counselors are young I 'm certain words and these days and item um I just wanted to really clarify that the item you people come out there is very much procedural rush it 's a legislative change weekly menu August that 's necessitated us making some tweaks to our existing teensy policy and we 've got a very short timeframe grape tomatoes given the requirements and the new legislation but I really wanted to emphasize is that we 're doing a full comprehensive reputed policy right at the moment where dissipating here in the workshop with you on that towards the I think about the third week in October so the VA an opportunity to sink your teeth into the policies detail at that spinach and then obviously flowing on from that will go out and we 'll do thorough consultation as part of their long-term cleaner princess so today very much procedural not mean those legislative changes in there and way over so that 's when we the developers and all the people that actually affected by this policy coming and presenting resolution that 's it adopts that ebony Kyle taken secretly draft hit the road so this 2 2 's pigs that learned it sorry sorry and basically another aspect of the new amendment eggs that brought in some changes which we went through with the workshops and was actually we don 't have to go out and consult now on certain items and DC 's was one of these so from a procedural factor because we had to do these changes what we 've done is basically just a moon did our count a DC policy and because of the time frame we only had a month to actually get these all done so there was no way that we could actually make these changes in the meaningful manner and if we were doing a full review and so that 's why we weren 't with just let 's get these amendments in that work we 're legislated and we 'll use the new amendment requirements from the new amendment to the local government neck that says we don 't need to consult so we 've used both aspects of we will consult just the same as any other with the actual full review that we 're doing so be finalized done as part of the RTP that then for with you not this amendment the full review and it 's completely being completely rewritten as well I might add and so it shall be much simpler for you tasty understanding DC policy as well just fantastic the Christian we 've got a lot to read lines you 've got red lines that cross yeah right jump into that now up here just in case so either big bits other bits been changed so the Crosstown bits pretty much the bits of gold as the rig boots then are basically new are the Lubitz so it 's extremely simple and whenever one of the really annoying things that they actually did was instead of using the word with you ever change that to out exactly so so there are few and crossed out and added a new read and so on yeah but that 's basically what changes the really interesting change is probably the introduction of the objection process commissioners and there 's a list of those a well on me do you are a website and yes so pretty much these are truly legislated requirements that were a mess we are all well aware that got red rushed through before um before Parliament adjourned yes this is just nice just like she kept within a month of your sins so that was why this was even Delaware Jimbo why send for the out to be an finalized also so has anyone got any queries on the red lines not that that we not that we can change or decreasing them because they 're legislate see just just a particular ship pages one just looking at page 53 I assume that 's to be with the growth projection are those some ways actions have been some of these due to the legislation obviously are now probably also our annual plan where we 've got all those red lines crossed out and then perhaps well there is one the infrastructure tapos f local pork it 's got 92 down to 55 what so one of the major changes of the could create either disease yeah so and basically the the cross lines and the dolls is just a reflection of here we 're not allowed to it click them anymore but we 're actually relatively in a good place because we never really collected for some of the big items that other councils are going to be in difficulty like-for-like basis and things like that we 've never done that so ok cancel beard just a couple of questions and on 10 14 and there 's no mention of manga keno miss Darrow mr. spaz feed maggie keno included in our DC policy 10 to 14 or what patient for team clause cool we mentioned tapper tutoring accurate ow acacia bag kinloch or to any secondly just on that graph of 10 bar 47 I have to confess my eyes just could not read any of the black pipe on the blue I have no idea what you thought you were there 47 so I haven 't got the ax jingle in front of the other look at the young the actual DC policy such like thank you and just tkm p crystal award again means we 're going to be fixed up with the full review and it just wasn 't necessary to change the standing DC promising as it is Jill I 'm no timber 64 now this is the to determine groceries that 's real terms this is part of an act of parliament these possibly teams little creek by the VA not necessarily all of them and again with the full review if it 's actually determine somewhere else we 're not going to boot wind Whistler will order it to the policy I 'm interested in what they define as a residential unit 1964 this is from your existing can 't renew at the moment you will be as part of your long-term plan all this amendment is don 't happen vector very small changes the whole policy of these Christians that you 'll ask just to raise the question regards the definition of a residence when it 's takes us detect building with a bathroom and kitchen the bathroom and a food a toilet body facilities the kitchen will have a sink if a the house it must be able to be accessed from inside the house care is not included for it not to be considered a second or subsequent building dwelling I 'll keep a note of that for all we know about wanting mean it fits in with our rating the moment of building such as that and that was determined to own a previous and development of the DC policy so then the last one was done at the last hour TP so 2012 's Truman and yes it 's just a couple of things see talking about because and the glossary is as well at CS long-term council community clean I don 't know whether that needs to change remember no definitions have reduced subsequently out of sight there is a lot of glossary of terms which I find were actually defined in the legislation or defined elsewhere so there 's a significant reduction in the glossary returns from the new policy that will be so eventually within our workshops in just another m and timber 53 in like on subsequent pages could a taste belt wrong three alex pack sorry cancer suski I was just going to say happy to move every move Thank You counselor sake thank you I think signal if I can swap back just in time and thank you Jane thank you sir oh yes verizon favor please say aye aye against Kerry item number 11 electoral system predictions was a very popular 280 working locals Jace Council wishes to change its electoral system for voting on the current biswas boost past the post it needs to do so by the 12th of soft timber

queries on I 've got at the years about sixty thousand dollars and eleven battery to do a poll well I said you should any money the community at any time with five percent of voters request a pole and we have to do it okay does anyone want to change just just a quick game final verification every six years not every three years for this particular one which is around how you vote whatever the council resolution is continues until it 's changed however you might be talking about the representation review which is every six years but this one as as really and this council decides to change it it can remain the same so and basically if the report wouldn 't come up to you in it would remain this first past the post but this is just the opportunity the Utah to review it sorry that she and you know this is just really a chips and balance for us to come up and head this especially to Train iam so it is iffy is this the same question all the same time to just revisit what happened when sadly Keith passed away and we hit ever by-election this no it 's not the same thing this is you know you vote for the hospital board what are they called yeah yeah you gotta go one two three and four how many people sounds a bit of the word stuff there that most would suggest i forget what I ticked actually the regular ones that came in it was a huge amount so we 've yet to counsel you know you go one two you know good selection so people just get completely bamboozled over it and i think this system we have now sir certainly the best add that i can see that the chair my understanding I 'm serious eh basa legislated to do the other system I think there 's any council that has these TD yes might be about the best way was to movies with the messy sorry yeah we 'd I digress a little bit um yeah this is what was they convict CEO that the badge is given option one because cause this confusion proposal will confuse doesn 't all right suggest a resolution there see anyone see the moon thank you can tell John 's see my counselor cousin all those in favor please say aye against Erica 's off ok won 't even try and add to the conversation application last year about what was going to happen to any question some of thing as an out of town right now to be able to receive I how how do we educate ratepayers okay okay i believe the large resume is revelation as SN t ARA as a writer out they should be given the opportunity yeah so there is a a i suppose a process that that does happen and last time there was a little notice that went into all the rates rates and use letters reminding non-resident ratepayers that they needed to enroll and existing people on the roll i sent letters each each election to see whether they are still an a out of town right path might have changed addresses something along those lines we could do some media some media press releases um so yeah thank you yeah yeah Wilson I don 't know me too well thanks Tina _"

interested retail yeah I 've done I 've just like 2m sort of mentioned the appreciation of these these individuals who are putting up their own cash and expertise to invest in people who are trying to move forward and growing your business or developing your business and I certainly think that the council should support that 's rather than sort of give them some sort of em image fish we 're

    "text": "to broadlands road area-wide treatment you worship I have a report here fairy we were treatment and tinder on Woodland Road and what I will take the reporters read and ask for any questions questions mr. Lohse a castle packed and is always amazed asked if he was like consideration given to the lucky fin tenders the tendon is a Louis press conforming which suit set the criteria and fingers are required to submit nonprofit tributes and then evaluated on fess so thick the youth that 's a not specifically it has to conform with on duty in the rules and regulations can 't apply discretion in that respect so famous adjourn it was the last ten doesn 't see this this creep just just following what cancer pack their difficulty give us a difficulty what 's the story with local teams have local Tina was ten grand away or something like that there 's no way that you can favor the local tindra currently council doesn 't have any policy that gives direction on what might can constitute a local timber and by how much you would want to in the future or was that not a track that we in d go down and hopes mr. Fox not like to talk about the procurement policy that went before the collision risk committee mr. Lewis thank you human we bring a procurement policy there were boys perfumer policy to the next council we email this relates to their whole issue of talks about path this issue renegotiating with with tendras may recall that was the matter before I think that in terms of the discussion we 're having here i 'm not sure Dennis will be actually gone to that extent into discussion so that something that might be raised at that meeting we talked about awesome so anyone 's getting particular queries and questions from local contractors I see how to our local jobs and possibly we have them we have a opportunity going forward to discuss these matters India 's has quite rightly highlight of the issue is it 15 to program determining what is local yes for javi so just to clarify are you saying at the moment we cannot do that we are not able the request for tender what it was a little crisp attendant currently within the request for tenders that we account reassuring for council there is no provision for considering um a local timber and making provision or an allowance for them because we don 't have anything as a council policy so we could change the policy let 's see it coming going forward because it did it mr. Fox has offered that gets the discussion obviously you will have when you have the new policy draft before you even my question is a complete the same as it again through route through the Chairman you 're at liberty to do that through your three rounds of channels the issue would be where you don 't apply a lowest common forming acceptance you would risk New Zealand Transport Agency from them and that might not just be the funding portion of the difference it could be that they would object strongly to your policy and therefore back out of a significant portion of funding so that you know have that discussion by all means but just be aware that it agency funding they pay for how much of this just immerse us roughly fifty percent for the over yep just okay yes cancelled on budgeting about 1.9 million society treats for renewals just expenditures roughly 400,000 and is it a priority in time just wondering whatever demands we handle early in the show yep this this is a priori it is plain words essentially the rehabilitation the remains of pavements you rather put it on reseal where where the road is that deformed OBC a was not there than the least all of life 's cost option when you 're looking at rehabilitation yes just a question to mr. Swire on the sub again obviously well non several contracting firm owned by counsel Sam in the Hawke 's Bay is we recently gone to receivership I presume a real covered and any tenders that we go forward as far as civil contracts concerned as firm does tip over yes yeah so someone else picks up the work and carries on or you paid until certain it 's below mechanisms in place robertico great thank you hoosier cancels I don 't figures mr. Lewis 's mixtures of the fifty three percent subsidy I said it was split fifty percent yeah yeah so Victor Lee figure that this has been accepted for tender is that fifty percent of that that we pay correct yes so effectively when when we look at our books that will be half as the cost of that 1.9 you look into any job whether it 's slightly slightly different though because we would swim would show that complete expenditure in our books because we they 'll receive the real boat from ends at a different time you know it 's been moved here by Councillor pack a comb-over city councillor John 's thank you very much ok suggested resolution there that we award infra max construction limited of tick witty and go here 's a bit job so we moved in second all those in favor please say aye against Aaron item number five or so first night here so far every report for acceptance of a tender and food section of where to raid and conceal extension it 's about 1.8 went quite nine kilometers I question is um if he was budget leaped over you 're looking at doing another ride it mattia right yes but i just note and that still you will still be remaining part of weirder to ride it 's not soon as the reason why you wouldn 't just continue to seal it right there we 're using the thought the matrix to determine priorities and we 're safe trying to move some of the funding around a little bit so that about concentrate all of the funding and the one spot for example new sewing we 're two road are not we were to right now to your router 's got quite a long length and so you could end up spending five or six years doing we 're to road to the exclusion of anything else when there will be other ride so have equal work so we do tend to move them around a bit and to treat an economical links thank you very much cancer krasovsky very question to what with will let right be seen buckle with one meter carriageway i would need to confirm meters but i would need to keep the plans just to confirm it just trying to do a very good kind of a regulation s 2 day cost their kilometers maybe to provide that information they will confirm it that 's the body which is this raise the crucial for bar 2 is the same company which is interesting both lower protein is off the whole lot from the 200 it states that the price will be 31 6460 but at the bottom of page full bar to its states the financial impact of the proposal is estimated to be you know it can be estimated live as a team that 's the team do is for 340 116 the financial impact us a couple 30 so true 3163 husband no kinder about engineers istant was full of 340 the team depress was 316 460 in 57 cents and the financial impact of 316 460 so it with just a motive the 57 seats just use the word estimated via 10 de mar de the event will include a small contingent see some letters only speak really sincere and so mind that the tenders are based on our schedule of unit rights for for certain quantities so those quantities will vary as the contract is under token so the phone or price is an estimate and it 's not a fixed price quote it 's a quote based on a schedule of quantities that are provided at the time of tender to give the client and understanding of how much it is very likely to cost so it 's always an estimate until the works were actually physically completed and the harnesses on the client and the supervisor acting for the client to make sure that we don 't overspend on that particular tender is any to too many descriptions easily okay one last question to lower this contract is awarded to the stallion sitting contract between awarded how you have confidence that they have jessica Lee two chambers of the spammer they 're doing the summertime Calypso a day at different times and just want to make sure that we copy too much work too much we have an in-between you discussions at this point where they might do what the outcome of the meeting is today and it is not know their project is time critical so there is the opportunity to either do them and together were one after the other okay thank you Miss plus any other questions or queries mr. Lewis alright suggested resolution that it 's a rose seal extension being wanted to and from X as well only mode by councillor body see muted by council hickman all those in favor please say aye all right against Eric item number five do any town center operate stage three mr. Andrew bugling is asked for a pic will give you what the scope of rupees for the project customer says you want here sorta computer I think maybe we 'll really miss directly unique Nottingham but Andrew bone and Scott acting isn 't to give you an overview later this afternoon Fraser this is the geranium polarization project and two areas is the frontier in kuala krai shop the non-linear area

who stop that that 's it there 's some seizing their model is so we 'll give our classes at two tenders pack one down and Higgins any arrested thinking 's provisional son make the engineer 's estimate okay thanks Adrian thinks Fraser Casa Cristo see just a couple of questions and when would you be contemplating of starting it and when would you be contemplating having it completed I 'll visit where we started to use on finishing your father ended so Andrew does this contract include just the hard landscaping because these are construction companies or does it include all the planting all the crest in all their hearts notices this contract includes decoration month get all our mascara construction our staff and to Maggie will supply installed outside please come right through our purchasing tender materials to keep the cost down sort out the private contractors market growing establish survives and you leave the tour an example of one in streaks care in seven provided only seating for their continued offenses for hugely at that time pubs and odor in store nice comfortable at the rear of the law they sadly we 've got some writing that our power box phase out battery in july contract except electrical also so there are other smaller supply vs minus del contracts outside this one and all that materials writing account will be coordinated scene and the annual plan there was a total of four hundred thirty-eight thousand so all about all those between this available supply contract so it will all come under 430 ok I 'm exactly on there 's a bill from what about the continuance or 30,000 but still within that man got your assurance it 's just for 38 including the city yeah that 's what I 'm asking the question register aliens manatee that 's a lotta miss you 're like yes always that 's what you wish with thinking in tricked I just latina verification services diplomatic way of negotiating with them good reasons as a scientific application given to the V Pezzini to the other and the other dangerous will a justifiable which indicates I don 't want to do that could blow up some of those things if I go Shelly could be to support you higher than the other contracted this early I for tenders we 've got submissions okay that 's fair but I think it is the cousins are you injured what we 're trying to work we 're also trying to use local contractors so I know that what thinking 's have got some prices in themselves for certain elements in the work should be appointed as that to negotiate with local contractors one of which puts on the sketch pad it 's as good I 'd like to make this difficult just to question Andrew and retailers obviously the retailer 's involved they 've been fully informed as to what the construction period will be the Imperium convenience that they 'll probably notice for a while we have some history on the Syria where you know it retailers earth you got to keep them sort of happy and informed of what 's happening want to

crown and at the stage the conversations we 've had with the ground three years ago it sir getting to be how long as a piece of string is to any time frame and on the basis that there are other

the emerging chanson hungry can talk to each other about the significance and patient policy of hearing like policy they complement each other right rather than okay Vicki softly I just on that time I to have some growing reservations as regards to a number of different documents that we are signing up to some of them which are now statement have overarching overlapping and duplicating type of scenarios and erase wagon take on 514 and the white of waikato mayoral forum in 2012 and the second sentence it says an additional word strength of bylaws and policies which going on from counts level hack a sort of raises some issues as regards to the number of different like both less we 're having some policies this we having some policies I just want to be sure that we are not getting into too many different organizations that are potentially doing the same sort of work and duplicating resources our times and perhaps diminishing also the the grassroot democracy point I want to make noted from my perspective and I 'm so excited for the chair i 'm constantly aware of that many different directions so we have staff that do attend in both the bay and the waikato but we tend to only commit to one side when it comes to a specific project being delivered and therefore we we avoid duplication rather than get dragged into duplication but with it 's someone we constantly keep it oiled he ever questions of queries ethnic thank you dick ok we 're going to suggested that resolution to get anything the other thing that we are looking for is part of this resolution just same as we manage the last body so if you 're on a dog is a conflict of a trust a little yes sir just just in relation to the other time that we did some Bible reviews could we 're not least use and I 'm apologize to

project so again there 's a forum on the twenty-third of October and two counselors are invited to attend and it I think it 's quite reasonable amount of time it 's quite involved you have to read

the digital stream or the water treatment plant so what I 'm wondering is are we able to see the original notes taken of that particular meeting yes you can I 've got from here be just to clarify the resolution in terms of 24 attire street car park that you moved words of the council meeting on the twenty-fourth not not at this we didn 't do any moving in the annual plan process that was basically a show of hands and the consensus is that most of you agreed not everybody therefore the word you wish of the work consensus should be taken up on a stand by the point I 've made we voted and then I if I remember you were you ask for a show of hands so I wasn 't straw late got an indication of in the area come here we shop mhm and then we 've actually moved a resolution to that effect obviously excellent or something the point I 'm making I don 't believe they fairly and accurately reflected the discussion that took place on that 26th of maize meeting you suggest a medic edding quite happy to you want to add some water to the marks here say a hand please what would you like edit well the point I 'm trying to make is there was no world came there was no tape recording I didn 't have the ability to go back and check and I 'm pretty sure there was a vote taken it may well be followed by a show of hands however it doesn 't record that that vote was taken there 's no reference to the outcomes on the water treatment platform debate all the one to do with the digital screen when they done later at a subsequent on that particular day decisions were made see you there we promote clean sweep human a special counsel boys photo essay in a good way is that maybe our processes wind of this and do you mean the minute taking yeah yeah we get when we do think we said this shouldn 't happen again and I 'm happy to adjust the military of you if you want to add something to these particular minutes on one bat 27 but i 'll be very happy from my point of view and it 's up to the counselors to accept i believe it doesn 't truly reflect the conversations and decisions will be made on the day councils feel like things pretty well some small actually from my perspective from that that deliberation process that 's just shouldn 't use the process Nathan like experience I we did had the show of hands on that particular issue I assume that was a perhaps of both but obviously I do take on board that wasn 't formal process no resolution was because he didn 't know they seeking to know no emotion so it was a virtually was a show of hands be indicative subsequently full count full council who I understand where the process had to go through to be simply worship the words we use that we do not fill the two for a street car pack consensus has been used which should be removed because it wasn 't a consensus consensus and it was a bit of a misleading indication of what actually have a net that meeting members feel that the minutes should be adjusted accordingly well I would move that the word consensus be removed what replaced with the delicious of a majority replaced with what you worship translated okay any any other fish to one more point here you worship on them made one bar 37 located in the notes under the six items that are shown to have been passed I did a bit staked here that body noted deceived to two and three above I also voted against number one which was the thousand dollars to the orchestra the minutes could be older to reflect their please verification or medicine from this minute just really small when we met but on page um one bathroom on by 35 and it 's about let 's either wait Kleagle Blakely but it 's spelt differently um throughout yes oh yes it 's to be corrected to osu cycling they 're just a comment to regarding the replies to all although submitters would you confirm when they was sent please it 's just the tired a phone call only last week I need this particular person said he hadn 't had a reply to his submission which which surprised me a little bit because I thought they 'd all gone in what 's fine I 'm satisfied with that she knows mr. Degas cancer hicklin has now raised the question of the responses to deliberations we have the council 's response of deliberation sent to us you haven 't seen the individual wording that 's going out could you tell me the contradiction between what happened last week in regards of the options not including the the rating end with readiness the revenue and finance and raking policies there 's the decisions we 've made not to put that out for um it 's part of the options to bait the reason I raised that is that during the deliberations and responses from council is just one of a number this one states the rearview finance rating policies will be considered by council discussed estimate so this is a member of the Supreme oscillation process as per the options debate going to implant whichever gently in response that your worship and I 'm sorry mr. Greene of unnecessary but you said very first particularly not revenue and financing at the in-state and rating policy that 's all it 's not been given as an option to the people to discuss now by a majority and just that point term mr. chairman amidst a few minutes yes it is because counseling has raised the one to do with the responses is imminent which is in the items in the minute yeah I feel it from now on I will probably call Shore a division on each vote so that the names of the pieces about either way and a resolution they 're going to be recorded not heavenly webcam on these meetings makes it quite difficult to see where the votes came from okay any other questions of queries points of clarification on these memories yes there is cancer buddy we 're still on May twenty secretory movie we moved to June how do we 's millets one bar 43 the item 8 last paragraph it reads a number of members expressed concern a member please consider the number of that another media 's relation any plan had been cancelled and there they had not been given opportunity for members to opportunity to review the operational budget in potential rate reductions then goes on group manager financial regulatory and infrastructure noted that the invitation was extended to all councillors to meet one-on-one if they had outstanding concerns or issues if I remember missed meant an old trick if i 'm wrong i believe that those two had no relation one was asking why we hadn 't spent more time looking at rate in the rates down the second one was that the opportunity was given to talk on the finances the way the 8th annual plan finances were set up and those been linked together to me give a misleading indication of what actually way it happened the invitation was there for any counselor to discuss any aspect of the finances and respect of the NFF that is rude as councils wish to make it comment we were discussing as per the circulation that I did of the what other councils were doing that we did not get an opportunity to look at where we could cut the rate increases for the annual plan budget nothing to do with the way the finance is with the other questions or queries but I would move your worship that those two sentences be put in two separate paragraphs never there okay anything else canceled by get the stage now you worship the counselors okay drive a mover for those monsters sadly cancer covers all those in favor be say I against Gary item number two just a few am in Jinja receive the minutes of the water from risk committee to ringy Tonga dead Oh humidity board and Mingo County representative Chris do we have any theories on those basic move I 'll do their lives awesome welcome it is that unlike the revised version of Lies wish I don 't yet tonight okay so

get back to you we done the manga keno just a bit about unlocking I guess I just write the question of it one of the meetings with the discussing decided to not just it 's not a big fish tissue i have used the fact that they 're going to use a wood good time yeah was that the imported wood or was at the type of time that 's the important brought her look so the importer would ended up cheaper than necessary fine yes that 's at ribbon exciting movement and it was in bed to making up our penguins and wendy jailed we asked what their budget was for monkey know and they see it was normally three

we have her benefits out of founding members abab place and there are costs that we have incurred so it 's being swings and roundabouts but it 's matter whether you believe and support their shoot services concept or not I just make a comment on balance we we have done better out of less than had we not remember plus I wouldn 't say it 's a significant amount of money but but on balance we have done gotta say we 're not in profit as a result of but less the issue has arisen because up until this point in time capsules had previously given writers of comfort rather than the virtual cash injections that it was operating technically insolvent but there was a latter of comfort to give the ability for the company to operate on the basis that it was born under weapon there are certain councils that have expressed their dissatisfaction with the insolvency issue resolved and that 's why this paper has been brought forward I made in favor of the resolution discussion amazin famously say yes I don 't eat small counselors to be notified council still delicious we hit so in the short term we can convince to run so then we 're not all right so we really need someone loving better do you would you be keen what I be keen yeah did you do it last time I did I was a commissioner last time yes and as long as my brain cells are still up to it I 'll give it another shot um but we obviously need another one I 'm for that I 'm shortly remaining two more to really like to do it but not that not the time instead the next one I 'd rather do the next one please if I can I was quite keen to do the September one but if it becomes a real issue for the council then I see if I can juggle my diary into the august one but i prefer sip team that post have you guys to close alone estas be challenged anyone else in because I Harvey September if possible yeah it 's two days yeah I 'd like to talk to your worship and I 'm glad that people have voted for this because under the RMA its intent was to have local input and by not having an local councillors on the car under Commissioner on the committee therefore you 're losing that very valuable a local input so thank you for putting you know what I paid it 's very well oh very cool lots of study though you can remember study before an exam yet a pass an exam that 's right and any other smile my time I just like to to just well probably apologize to cancel because i wear with Kirsti and because I add the certificate for three years never sat on a carries committee so I suppose my mine was in a place where I thought well do I really want to go to this and take all the trouble of going through all that and they 're not using it and to to the course people because I felt that the course was rushed it was far too many people in the room it was only house was only a refresher course it was one day course and room the ring was very very tight and they rushed through the whole process and because of that and I don 't think it was a good cause for me because we hadn 't got that experience of some of the other people that was there and I did start the assignment I got probably three-quarters of the way through it i had a fortnight 's holiday in between it and I just I just ran out of time you 've gotta live on top of that they have changed it before you could add actually submit what am I called long and not through the computer system we curse is okay she 's pretty well up with that but i 'm i 'm not a typist I 've never little dirty toilet so it 's really difficult so what I 'm just saying for 30 people like where 's the analyst it 's mostly you it 'd be prepared to spend probably 40 hours at least honestly we 're safe I mean it 's just a lot it 's not is a tough tough assignment I was always really write that art that I got the original invitation presentation is not the first ones not so bad because it 's 10 days and they take you through the daddies feel as well as they don 't say we haven 't made many application it 's so unfortunate castles throw a hitter city of worth where 's main asset situation i spelling he can maybe a cipher motivate one in series okay no near in a really positive refresher make sure you still believe people yeah if you never been to one two three you horse slaughter they people it 's been three years until there 's a funny this first one they take it from start to finish toes and you definitely it 's one of the best courses for learning oh no mistake is really good to decide when unpacking certain they don 't do it lightly because it 's not resolution oh yeah I don 't answer those at the interface I like 80 yep so the next one on the air as healthy indeed have got a week shop and Tara when they limit of july and covering a variety of different s beats and which thought members might be interested in and so that available anybody would like to go to that they 're attached on 18 bar 3 okay all right I 'll go through this resolution year

Harvey enjoy lens for the sixteenth and seventeenth of September in the same and resolution yeah I knew I don 't have to convey yeah okay yes recent number three anyone keen to go tear on it would but I 'll be MTG sorry that 's different removable think what Union okay so forget about number 30 so we 've got some appointments and if you recall we had one vacancy still from the to wait till after their outcome of the by-election to let vacancy yes the treatment of you preferred option there no no whoever wants to put the hand up like Skype acts and lunches respectful interesting penetration I don 't want you know okay the only thing is then think about the council Bernhard is that you know obviously um he just wondered Weaver been one of the opportunity that was all because you 're gonna be like yeah a little bit lighter on duties and some of the other psych fest sorry the next thing you 'll just carry on with bikefest tagged out Elvis right so sure that 's what i end up to be exorcism with white face isn 't it is a counselor quite wants disease what minute I shouldn 't should all caps with him you got a nice time I 'm happy given whatever way I think counselor crystal ski is indicated that in a is not really one of his preferred the feeling is that there should be a member of that committee arm I point in is making mobile is about twenty that is almost made of I 'm not about creative you all do why please I 'm saying is that if there is somebody else in the chamber it prefers to be a member of that committee doh I 'm not going to stand in their way yeah so John was

    "text": "each other much I footpath extension between page 22 which is from the community facilities group of activities and it 's just added the extra project for the purification system at the public toilets stump Bayon page 24 which was the story box about leasing space beside the lake terrace viewing platform and we made changes as i said earlier and based on the decisions or the discussions that you had in deliberations and i wasn 't proposing to make any further changes but let me know if you in light of your decision today won 't further changes to that story books and page 25 another straw box the one about going digital and again we made the changes based on the discussions that you had during deliberations and again I wasn 't proposing to make any further changes but let me know if you think in light of your decision today you need to and page 26 the only again and story boxes but the only change was taking the word draft out page 27 which again is the community facilities funding impact statement and then page 28 that puts that new project in and pay 29 was just a mistake that we realized we had an air raid called the broadlands road resource recovery park um something other than its proper name I can 't remember what we called it we call it the landfill but there 's correct term it 's correct name as the Borden 's road and there 's also recovery parts that we 've just amended that and changed but I just asked the question how the system works in the long term plan solid waste it mentions projects over three years I notice has been some construction out of the landfill last year Shira now where does that money come from it it 's not allocated in the long term plan I referred to roof the barriers around we you drop copy rubbishes not even sure whether the war you put your bottle tree was in the long term clean we have a source of money somewhere we decide that we my new is correct and Dennis may be under cream before it was wrong is that the the actual contractor provided certainly know when I took some stuff out there recently that the check out there was quite friendly talked about how they 've invested i believe the figure was three million dollars or something out there up their money into that area like it they return through the contract given the three million dollars too much recycled I was very clever to saving and Monticello reading this on paper today everyone thinks um so page 30 and 31 and funding impact statements for solid waste and democracy and planning just really those changes flowing through page 32 the story box about the 24 o street car park and again this was based on the discussions that you had in the deliberations and we were proposing a change to this one in light of your discussion today on page 33 where the red text is underlined it reads while the council identified option one selling the site as its preferred choice when it went out for consultation once submissions were considered council decided that and then we were going to add the following words it would defer the sale for the investigations into market interest and any opportunities to work with adjoining property owners and then we were intending to delete the rest of what we had identified as being added there and that was to try and accurately reflect what you decided today and Elena everything investigation so maybe it 's a bit of said that we 'd pending in between the two sentences so would approve the sale for 12 months meaning that keeping an investigation into my interest money doesn 't usually notice what he said oh yeah I say he up so we join it up it just makes an incredibly long sentence we just need to find a place that we can break it I just want Tara fication on exactly what 's it yeah get rid of I 'll have a full stop after the way it rains now it sounds like we 're putting it on the market into not was pretty so if we take the word while out at the beginning of that sentence at the top of page 33 and it would read the council identified option one selling the site full stop once submissions were considered the council decided that and maybe we change the terminology we had here it would defer the sale look for the period of 12 months to allow further investigation into market interest and any opportunities to work with the joining population of the south yea I think it 's the defer the sale that 's too definitive isn 't it yeah which will be revisited in 12 months time once their investigation into fear this yeah yeah just certain I mean I don 't think it has to has to mirror the intention of the resolution but my English the option has to move our earthly of the resolution are you happy with that time Errol what always the intention really was a third defer the sales whether it I mean I 'd put 12 for a period of 12 months because I felt that could line up with the long-term plan and in further investigation into market interest and the opportunity with joining program is immense long sentence per mile doesn 't matter does it yeah dear double to Munson our interesting time again ok so if we make that change then page 34 and 35 amendments to the financial tables and 36 and 37 38 not all neg entitled financial tables continue right through free worship I just had some numbers that we 're a discrepancy for mean I just acquired some clarification on page 39 of the attachments that we 're looking at the final number on total net assets is actually different to what 's in the draft plan we put out some full submission I just wondering if someone could clarify why there 's a discrete totally acid on the first objective statement that we 're going out with us is 110 Steven on the draft that we went out with it 's got 11 10 it 's not secondly any change just wondering what I do you know and 59 of the draft a different graph you can it 's 110 total any settings for the annual campaign and on this one here 1107 yeah you must one the one we atleast accounts that figure I 'm final verse your spec figure there I think and that 's really i think if i look at it it looks like it might be financial assets under current assets he also council created reserves this like to have a protection trust that 's what is we had that showing actually incorrectly in the draft and that 's been created from final and the reserve funds yet i think what that was at this great yep it would really help me with with the system we hit we have the annual plan that we weed out with see the figures we have the draft from the front of us if you want to document the bag final document and the draft have the same figures the original draft we have for consultation doesn 't some of the students is who can also change draft we really out with I 'm saying that 's right so Rosen finger protection trust three months sorry three in achievement so the three million different if that 's the trust work all the way through those figures yes oh so fundamentally it is I guess there 's three things that have really occurred from the draft grants it 's been paid for from the savings from the side waist activity is the two and a half thousand for the footpaths extension the three and a half thousand for the water at motor oppa oh sorry son baby bun and then there was the correction of how the lake tahoe trust reserve funds were quickly shown in the draft and there was actually picked up by one of the submitters and that 's been corrected in the in the final so the other be the changes that have occurred to the financial statements figures from the original graph that went out for consultation have been updated so the draft that we 've got in front of us now to the final that we have in front of us now final in the draft of the same nothing on you excuse me um what I think counselor body is saying is that we are in the word you 've got the markups further changes there 's no red no caps on the numbers alright bigger pardon sorry um yes yes I do so you 're saying there we quite quite correct what we 've done is we 've updated financial statements from the draft in the corner and we just do that through our models we haven 't gone through and done a redline version like we 've done the words that we need corrective on the front of this one the menu plan draft a new plane yes one way of the one we 're looking at the red line one yeah what on the front is this graphically that final plan don 't know is the final so the one the front of this is the final has no draft on it just as annual plan I thought I think what Neil saying is they have they have a captured or red line for changes to the numbers which prop from I guess from a governance point of you I would quite like to see I mean I we 've picked up this one are there any others we should be looking at apart from those additions and subtractions that you mentioned know and I guess the reason we have another because you will really make thought that was a little bit too much really is quite a bit I using my apologies for that I should have pointed that out absolutely so um that takes us to page 48 fees and charges the only changes here are in the draft the fees and charges we compared what was being proposed for the 1415 year fees and charges against the what was in the 13 14 year the current year and we have a column explaining whether or not there was a change all these do is take those two columns outlaws once the fees and charges are sex they 're set and there 's no need to have that comparison so you 'll see all the red lines strikeouts over the next few pages relate to those columns and that takes us to page 64 where we had in the draft the submission form obviously in the final we don 't need a submission form so that 's been taken out and substituted in its place is a table which is so easy and some text which is page 66 the road back of the made from the graph Daniel plan and we normally put this in so people can see what changes were actually made through that process just a question do we need to include something near about the lake protection trust thanks and having just heard that I thought it was referred to us a message to one of the semester hmm ok thank you soon alright you have questions or queries or so you 're suggested resolution meetings yeah we mean to someone think we we list what changes we got here in the housing living one of the feelings and texted connector cables have changed because the okay so we 've got two suggested resolution there are you worship I you decide which I just have another question about cut paste and I guess it 's for the top table if we had any response from audit New Zealand on our annual plan please newzealand have done their anthem audits as part of that they look at where we 're at as far as the processes and we 've had no feedback at all from them respect of this and the interim work they 're doing this for the year end naturally they take into account what 's happening as far as biscuits in just just before we go forward the wedding of the lake taupo take some trust it needs to be done here and now yeah so what do we want to save it wait so just clarify be moving on an amended annual green and you want to go on to them yeah next one yeah come back to it outdoor living you can 't_''_1141.679 do your rates one yet but you can skip to one of the other ones fun some thinking verification are made of you could forget some mammoth reading on mate like pepper in there doesn 't need to be amended serve you another as anxiety amended Benjamin things you can think we need to do ok we 'll go to item number 12 so it is that ok now skip fourth item number twelve adoption of the tree and vegetation policy house less working with as well so good I don 't really finish up here you 're moving away from I a bit more family time and myself I we used to be done on friday my last day it will be seven years and seven months to the day oh well done Karen thank you thank you very much for his fort I 'm really enjoyed out over the years so it 's been moved and seconded you have a discussion it 's no um is it wildlings of another so the crisis talking part take the report as being red hair can answer any questions just like to highlight 20 points in its first say that the proposed new license will have more limited operating days by approximately forty percent so that will enable the reserve to be used and more for events and other activities and also is the we 're in tears sexual reserve ground and then secondly the applicant has requested and that the license includes the right of assignment so that something council will need to decide on today assignment of intelligence so you can effectively and sell the license rights to northcross reserve not this for the sikh way present minus 3 minus unless on how you want to face the assignment term and the license and we have had rights of assignment for other licenses down the lake park for example the sting theme and that was a nap on assessment that the assignee is of a respectable professional nature and that it can be limited if you like or and ya know it slowly you 're assigning the right to the license so you 're saying the right to only operate the sigues and it 's just that the actual hold of license the name changes so we swear safeguards in it I don 't we under normal based agreement that we can say useful no to whoever might take back so we can say no to somebody who 's upper listeners I factor yeah and if you want the right of assignment told and yeah yeah voice makes it really difficult it does make it so what I have no Simon together I had turned down if he wanted to sell it to another business person for us to turn what 's your suggestion Ella not ever and that is they right of a summit it is unusual to heavier items on it proposed concern with us create which simply adds subject to cancel betting and any potential new operator there were some citizens council john and i just think you worship I just think if we were to put an addition and that seed subject to us facing i think it 's just so far no assignment and reassess the nuveen babe it 's an option it depends on the mayweather vet makes difference to the value of his business now just three previous counselors as his strap today sorry I just quickly before these counselors of counsel has always put on a right of assignment to allow and sum it up to allow the business beyond soul and so that was key that was a key philosophy with a lot of these commercial reese 's licenses okay so it 's okay for right a little yeah you 've got to be a little bit of an explorer unless you know the guys probably try to make some money if he gets offer you know it will devalue the villain no writing assignment so just be aware of that exactly Oh was it his determination to in his new police not to have the operating order to reduce his operation days was so we didn 't say the reserves not standing up he evaluated which where his most busiest days yeah limited that bro doing days from there and I would say he 's had quite a bit of commentary about the state of the actual grand service as you drive but you know that used to be like a bowling drink and it 's not near so so obviously he 's he said their commentary come to him I would say and good on in previous operator that was the previous operator I 've I feel this operates has been a lot better than the previous one so he sold to the previous operation sorry hello I 'm sorry I 'm definitely the previous operate yet he bought the pre from previous operator or couple years ago three years ago and this one is this operators a lot better than the previous one in terms of looking after the the Simon problem the original not know there wasn 't actually that came to council ok I came to counsel yes so I mean it still can 't come to counsel for ya for the change of ownership sorry just three worship to Duke just to confirm two things in one the current owner brought the business of another operator who didn 't have the right of assignment so yes so they came to us for a new of the trailer and can someone just clarify for me who the owner isn 't pure Kiwi adventures PM 's minds he owns the beds company well he beds are us he he owns a few businesses one of them being better for us for the other options a couple of sort of tourism things as well just so I was I jumped in there cuz I 'll sort of here working at the bat but with things like the coffee cart that was you know there was there was quite clear instruction there to have that rides with Simon and that was to enable those businesses to Unseld to have a direction from the previous council about encouraging visits and keeping longevity of business current operator requests for Harvey well I think to encourage you know business and operators together yeah a fear Chad store to sell businesses I think we have to be commercially minded and I think we should let them have that writing assignment um yeah right oven so I 'm but that 's it 's still going to be a break I 'm dice absolutely to us to come towards gets to come to us to prove that assignment so again sorry coffee cart it 's ugly that 's what happened so a proposal is put to two officers this was that was brought to council prior to any and the assignments so there was a little bit of vetting but it 's not for 22 that whether or not that businesses is the right to run one but there 's a little bit about one topic and emotional education leaders lately mainly clarify the reservation story of my idiot at the moment it does not state that it has to come back to Council all you which I agree with but it does not state that he had that it has to come back for Council for approval to the new owner and you could be getting am some sort of a shoddy operator coming in without you having any situation where feeling would be nice to be out in how many years earth 333 so they have to unless license driver 's license so you have to prove the license at lolzz under we Pam resolution one and just put it the subject from the right of assignment subject to council approval that 's fine um I guess you could even go a step further if you actually did what neck right of simonton and give the ability to says to assess and the proposed new license holders and to assign it over because then it really is a true right of assignment rather than my decision there 's my chicken to achieve the amendment yes just another note i 'm sorry i like the options the analysis of options around the wrong way option one an option to an HD accounted what so which was it council staff approval is otherwise it 's not a true right of assignment base to come back yeah I know we 're talking in circles but it 's a legal opinion everyone 's amazed won 't fight for you yeah otherwise I 'm p.m. point especially to officer it offers their approval yeah otherwise it 's not a true assignment next campaign to ask for a frugal it 's not it 's it 's a wishy-washy sorry to be frank not both kids is not only illegal info at least we make it your staff repeat that person into fortune one when i ordered us on that subject guessing we 're heading home i think most of the leases of assignment or only on council approval okay growing on me not office or retrieving the other right on all those in favor please say aye my life is against _"

    "text": "on to the next item item 10 which is the adoption of the annual plan and you 've heard the submissions on the annual plans you 've deliberated on them and through the deliberations you made some resolutions which are on page 10 bar to the first one that you would give a thousand dollars to the opus orchestra second one twenty thousand as a grant the top of golf golf club and the third one that 20,000 be included as a grant to town center topple also that you would add a project under the transport activity which was to extend the footpath on the western side of state highway one that you would add a project under the community facilities activity which is to install the ultraviolet purification sorry ultra light violet purification system at the public toilets at stump Bay and that you supported in principle and the purchase at nil low consideration for Mighty River Power and in tennis courts at folk Amaru I 'm also in May at your may meeting you adopted the fees and charges for animal meant animal management and environmental health 't need to re adopt those as part of this annual plan so we have taken those decisions of yours and made the changes to the draft annual plan document to this document to produce this document which is attachment 1 so that is the final annual plan attachment 2 is the strikeout changes that we have made to the draft annual plan to create the final annual plan and I 'm quite happy to take you through those changes because because the cousins on a nice put out awarded but I want to just one thing I forgot and the freest agenda item that I wanted to clarify this okay just under the town center tacos response that we sent to them or what you see you at the time of the meeting that we had councillor hobbies the clear message she wanted the scene isn 't what was on there which is that they seek other funding counselor he actually recommended that we seen a clear signal that the work was not up to par and I needed to pull their socks up it was correct they were think Mama 's lot more communication well you don 't know your silken yonder unnoticed and the communication or the community 's rapper we 've got the wrong message in near their fishers hopefully clarify though we did as well okay it was more based around that it wasn 't really based I think just it 's against Avila not though this a motor that I 've sorry I do don 't step day and you don 't want me to change it though well said to seek external funding I agree oh yeah well we didn 't say that not a man yes I 'm sorry three worships counts the cousins we did discussing it but I 'm not sure that that form is the right okay all right no I just want what the 58 additional money last 20 really yes it through the Cheetahs on page 26 of the decisions we 've clearly said we wish to seen a very clear signal this funding will not be put in the draft in your plan that talented at cycle should consider other options fun ministry so I get okay thank you so carry on in terms of in terms of attachment to and the strike out pages I 'm I 'm quite happy to go through them and that might be the easiest thing to do just quickly so it 's page it kind of starts just after a page 100 on this attachment which is agenda item 10 attachment set the document have you all got that one and if you turn to page 100 grand it on the bottom hand it on live on the bottom yeah and then it starts with attachment to page one are you all looking like this yeah yo so quickly take you through those strikeouts obviously the web draft has been taken out because it will no longer be a draft so those first two pages just take that out the next page amends the table of contents and it actually happens over on page four because we 've taken the submission form out and we 've put a summary of the changes from the draft annual plan in right at the back of the document which is what we page five and we 've taken the word draft out for the message from the mayor and councillors and you 'll see there 's a bit of rejigging down the bottom where the list of councillors names are the deputy mayor having a deputy mayor next to his name and and the new council are being added just on that you worship seeing this is a legal document that is infected in incorrect because I was not a counselor for the draft annual plan now this is the final excuse me this is that this is for the final aim of time however even for the final seeing I was not part of the angel plan process that should at the very least be a footnote to the effect that saying councillor crystal ski was elected you to a by-election but was not party to the annual plan process otherwise the assumption is that I was in fact had of the process which I was not whatever you have a legal opinion on that you you can is a right right today but you indicate that you 're not going yeah yeah you wish it so I 'm going to go back to 10 4 and the original document like a fellow the agenda is the paragraph that states that were using 1.5 million of property or forestry sales and to balance the budget I can 't remember reading it hey guys its main HTM 18 4 of the council 's budget today at the end of today second paragraph they 're all tuned up in the bottom new paragraph you referring the long term plan perhaps I can assist with this one the years of the balanced budget so when happy to do it now but the so specifically in your eyes and one of the requirements of the items and section 100 is the is the reference is that council must have a balanced budget and if you choose not to then you had to give your reasons why in the long term plan the financial strategy and moving to the not capitalizing interest on detainee longer was in year one been 2012-13 4.5 million as it sails and year to 5.15 and in year three which is to there so those were outlined the mountain plane and that has indeed come up in discussions during the drafting process and arm i recall sitting down with counselors Williams and and John 's going through that reconciliation end sorry and thank you yes Sam and indeed whatever your name is yep yeah in getting through a bit as well so yah hope that assists some counseling you wish it 's Castlevania supporting all that you thinking and you yeah I had this conversation with Neil this morning is with respectively if she won 't when I fought the balance the books is 1.5 surface you just explain the other that the only 33 and 20,000 where helps we can solve a year and thinking cancel arm so perhaps the easiest way for me to do that is to refer you to an S on the the handouts that you 've got their page 57 of the final anyway so i 'll just wait till everyone gets that so what we 'll be looking at is the young prospective statement of comprehensive reading room spins some everyone got there so 'll see in the brackets the operating surplus or deficit for 750 and so so that 's the operating surplus deficit for for the year we were referring to the balanced budget so what that 's made up of if you are when we reconcile that and back down to zero and as it 's made up of approximately 2.5 million of the depreciation that we don 't fund on the nzta sorry on transportation depreciation which is the NZTA share because we receive the subsidy from them for that it 's made up of the 1.5 million dollars asset sales and the other major component is the is roughly around 750 thousand top my head that we receive and forecast receiving development contributions to cover the interest portion of the DC dip so that 's basically how you arrive back to a balanced budget and those those are the workings that open have been through with the three councillors right and referred to before okay thanks Neil any other you want to point out Susie there are yes because we got to page five yes turn over twelve six 'll remember and counselors were concerned about a particular sentence the last sentence beginning at the end of that first paragraph under the chief executives message that said this means that for the second year in succession there 's no proposed rate increased directly attributed to the cost of delivering services into the community and they felt that that was confusing so that 's been removed we 're drafts being removed and then next page page seven the dates have been changed for the statement of compliance and word drive taken out that 's today 's date page eight and the list of the projects that council will do in this year again where draft being taken out and the two new projects added in the transport one the extension of the footpath that motor oppa and the installation of the ultraviolet for your vacation system extent babe page nine but just the web draft removed and ten again apologized um page nine so yes we are losing we 've taken out that statement from the CEOs report yes second year in succession no proposed rate increases directly contributed to at the point nine or 544 increase in rates fighting to maintain levels of services for existing activities yes the the wind and said that is exactly the same wording that went out in the draft and that is the how the numbers fall as a work so it is a factually correct statements i 'm not quite sure the Christian sorry counselor we 're not going out 14 15 stating we 've got a point nine and a 6.4 rating for a point nine of 524 k an increasing rate fighting to maintain levels of service for existing activities what we 've removed from the CEO report right to be an iced tea and corrected the second year there is no proposed rate increased rigor tribute for the cost of living services but we are in point in point knowing that I understand what you 're saying for that sections been deleted has a not so the slate was not deleted here the statements just not a bit into that it isn 't for saying that we 're taking a statement out to dinner the peers and no it 9 says that there 's been an additional point nine percent in rates funding to deliver the current activities the statement on page 6 says that has been no rate increase to the delivering food delivering services to the community so I think they were out and we 've taken that one out because that one 's misleading you Sanderson here we were there two cents and age nine yeah we 're going yeah we 're you saying that just are you worship just to clarify the way the reason we took it out is because it was potentially misleading because the increase is actually got depreciation you put into it so truck what rob is saying is actually technically true but could be misconstrued so which is why we asked for it to come out but what John said you started here again no it 's not not no does it so I think what 's all I hope what 's only an hour 's nation easily just not like a point nine percent increase in rates yeah yeah Anna forward but the way you problems wasn 't thinking I know I 'm smart it 's not if you read the paragraphs in front of it I think I think I personally think it 's fine this year we need 0.9 percent when rates funding to the love of the current activities where does it say that we 're not going to increase the rates which will take it out which rob was yeah okay so page 10 is just removing the web draft and page 12 and 13 and there was a typo as a mistake in there you 'll see the word week as correcting and it shouldn 't be pay up to one hundred dollars a week more it should be here hundred dollars completely over the year or so there 's an that 's crept in a few times we don 't want to send that message no and page 14 and you 'll see the financial tables all the way through this and they 've all been amended in accordance with your decision to give out an additional 41,000 in the community funds and so I wasn 't proposing or Neil I think wasn all that is is a change through those financial tables of that of that decision the next page page 15 and this is the beginning of this is the first of the story boxes so this is about the enlarged Rural Fire District which you had an item on today but you did discuss in deliberation so what we 've done is we 've changed the story boxes in accordance with the decisions you made in deliberations but obviously I 'm ready to change them again today and if you made a different decision and on this one you didn 't so I wasn 't proposing any further changes to this particular one agreed draft and your plan process and we 're about sorry whereabouts are you on the road section as part of the draft plan process it can be graphed and the plan and then the next two pages are obviously the financial tables that have been amended slightly age 18 adds the new project under the transport group of activities extension of the footpath on the western side of state highway 1 we said yesterday did we page 19 which is the transport funding impact statement obviously amended slightly together to do with the impact statement I raised the issue of the 1.9 any guards of rotation mr. Lewis said that he 'd given me a brain or give us a break the end up with an expenditure week passing 1.9 million of expenditure but we 're not sure where it 's going one denies I soon sorry cancel i can you refer me to learn exactly what you 're talking about in nineteen yes bae systems its existing assets she did capital expenditure which is on page 20 but on page 27 of that ok yields programs is your just reward renewals and i believe go ahead and it 's just a man i wanna see you succeed you seem to admit it would be used for certain things but I asked we 're not what wouldn 't have not be reasonable for us counselors you know we x-men 's you was going rather than lump sum they can be in her debt provided at some stage some stage isn 't really good enough for doing things are worked out through a complex asset management plans to the signed offline using and transport authority so Dennis you better give them a cup of the asset management plan the identifies where the 1.9 million dollars comes from yep that 's right because we wouldn 't get our funding from NZTA unless they 'd order to that document and we 're happy with it so that 'll be a starting point for the approach discussion down to the long-term plan if that helps it 's not a given imaging transport authorities viewers that we have to have a submersion plans that assess the condition of the roads that assess the edge of the roads and other number of different factors to work out what you need to do to keep the roads in recoleta condition and that 's where the 1.1 million dollars comes from is from I an analysis of the age the condition go ride quality the developer aking of that sort of stuff where the forward program has worked out in collaboration with NZTA to work out their funding and the percentage of funding and planning on your phone because we 've been through that rigorous process will enter to you right now what you do is you identify the average condition of your roads and from that condition of Iran 's you can look at what the expected level of expenditure should be on won 't work it 's not to say that that will be spanked it 's to say that that 's the expected amount that would be spent and then the rest is subjective management within the TA address I have for you he was a sack and so on I just wanted his products place for the opening what the big race and deserves one point for the entire obviously comes over the of this month win a pennant and the eurozone 's just fun history we 're friends with throughout the day 13 quiz seems like 10 times when just legal age 54 ever be sorry john h page one page 165 if you follow reserve funds 0 famine age 65 mm dose 1876 what the natives in theory then decrease in the reserves that does that leave what the funding of perennial programs works as follows renew our on those reserve funds and the depreciation flows that we received from the depreciation charges to employ in to reserve the outer flows of the reserves is the renewal programs and loan repayments thanks meal yes I am just just fake to their page 20 that counselor and body was just talking about the scheduler cabbies the trades will under the nu plain three for fifteen fifteen the tripper coming realignment there 's a dash does that mean there is no money in the in your plane which means that agenda item 16 them and cervix pete 's aura I sigh oh do I just not understand that 's 150,000 during the long term plan process though laterish traffic calming was originally spread over two years that 's right okay what we did through the draft in your planners take up the 1415 year and Lee and currently we have funding under thirteen fourteen year thank you _"

    "text": "sure that will protect walking and you 've got any girl double council policy through suspects tuna fish item number right afternoon so you afternoon yes herbicide I would like to thank the staff and Sue and everybody involved in preparing this document I think both for the submitters and for the counselors is an invaluable document and SS received a great deal of approval from their community that I 've spoken to slow dance good afternoon um your remember you deliberated on the unplanned submissions on the fourth and fifth of June and you made some decisions on each individual submission or groups of submissions where they will ask you for similar things with some reasons you 'll also remember that we you agreed to the table format with a covering letter to go out back to the submitters and as mr. Greene pointed out earlier the decisions on the for matters that we consulted on alongside with the annual plan have not been included in here because they were papers that were subject of today 's meeting but obviously those decisions will be written up and will be in that and senators will be sent a covering letter and I understand the communications manager has sent around a version of that letter to you but you have seen and the relevant part of the decisions report that applies to them so they won 't get the whole lot but the whole lot will be available on the website just in the interest of saving paper so for that to happen you 'll need to adopt the decisions report all those letters can actually go out and the decisions report is the attachment for agenda item 8 Christian affair is on the first the question about using the words options and challenges to bike yes it 's the first time I 've heard of that the bait means is that edgy bad you between two groups what 's it actually comprise over and that 's something that we 'll be talking to you about and through the 10-year plan process and our next workshop on that is the seventh of july but essentially it 's the the options debate is you decide what goes out of the options debate the public and and give some feedback on what they think of the options that are pre consultation basically for the long term bayless legislative leaders and just us two am particularly the responses to tyranny people and I haven 't spoken to the same me and Nicky gathers but just when i leave the council response the first sentence like the proposal to introduce is a shared space at the rear of the mall has been disgusting supported and principal that by the two tiny accommodative community would and i 'm just thinking that that sentence as a start before i 've read the rest i think that the community boards decided to go ahead with net that 's what I that 's the first impression I got because I had to reread it twice and if I just think that needs to be rebooted or taken out because it 's really that information as thank you for your information in this will be presented given to the community board to discuss as opposed to making it sound as if the community food is disgusting supported it have previously the whole of that first paragraphs the second one is the submission will be referred to the two-handed honorary community board to allow them to determine whether to yeah just a comment on page 24 David Etheridge is submission I just wonder whether there 's been a book is asking about the TKE committee and but I just wondered whether it to be prudent to say that we 'd we 'd set up the Fred committees like this this this triennium that 's the new committee that mates dealing with reserve issues dog issues whatever just just to bolster that a little bit we did talk about remember councillor cousins sorry cancer dollars thank you sorry um you worship so just take up counselor bodies comment about options and challenges this is a good opportunity for us to signal that the 10-year plan is coming up maybe just maybe a little bit more explanation on options and challenges just just to make it more that can mean so many different things to so many different people i know we will be going through the process but if we could just squish not too sure to ask actually just on the draft and you 're playing we had the notice about the rate at mony a cassette of titania is going to have an increase of one hundred fifty dollars i still haven 't seen any proof of that when do we get these when do I get to verify a bit in this case you 're asking is fine for something guys can 't_''_388.24 be reformed we was right there during the removal shot as I hilden Crocky strong remember when we all the workshops now we provided the summation of that data and that was what was in the drafting a plan quite correct counselor that we haven 't actually given you every individual property to provide evidence of there so I I accept that that 's certainly something that we could do but during the workshops we didn 't um good a new with the 22,000 individual lines of ratepayer bills only yeah I guess that could be provided now but we certainly have provided the summation of their data through the draft any plan process I understand either having referred to the minutes but I think in February we asked for information which I we would have it by May or June all all data on all rates and from the southern mate district for us counselors from the Career Award but we haven 't seen anything it 's nothing before some I 've been waiting I 've asked a couple of times for it and then I consider other rubber stamp lyst and I still can 't verify it that is the case let us consume me nothing Center staff here but that does to see me I think there may be a misunderstanding of Mobius on our behalf in terms of that question I thought that Christian was in relation to the difference between if we were on a land value system versus a capital value rating system not the difference between this year and last year to two separate questions yes correct but I think they all format it will fall out into this the end of the day my table you know they 're two separate things they 're definitely to several things being able to finalize the numbers was the objection to the valuation process and it 's only being of light that that 's really settled down but we 'll look at a way I know you would have liked it before today but we 'll try and find a way for you to be able to access the 22,000 rate payer and the information we must have at dartham now thank you letter that now you know CB they 'll be formulated things out and through the chair please subject of lv is not part of the spear my analysis i understand there we have it dat an hour week ok ok go through a really little one just on page 11 and 3 paragraph under decisions and reasons just could a toast that one okay thanks cuz through them this is suggested resolution their property we change it to you mean community another one clarification us silly cows oakland posted 9 my pet subject of evocations is to do you think we could we is it are we able to at least put a time frame on this please see a finite date that we definitely web but then they can put a something into the long-term plan or whatever is there any opportunity of mrs. knotless it would be part of the long-term Priam basis it will it doesn 't say that here currently being undertaken as part of the LTP process so the way those we 're tied at of our CEO it publicly say that you would get all the information by December as create so from the golf club point of view to the day enough to resubmit all that information back to the LPP and there 's a number of decisions sorry to share these number of decisions that council will be considering as part of the OTP process and respected water one of them might be a district great for water for example which is um a totally different topic but one that would affect this golf club yes there 's the steam of three it cuz it 's been going on for such a long time not if I might I 'm just concerned that so you can lay these days should build-up of the long-term plan in a few as a council water you included in the long-term plan any change I know that what are you dieting making some or if you do that ok ok thank you spoken on the on page 17 to submission need to do it outside Jim thanks a castle maintain the equipment I can 't remember that groups being used did we agree or don 't refer to the minute he agreed i looked at the recording and mr ridd was asked if it would if there 's much in terms of maintenance and and he replied that they 're fairly robust machines but um and and based on that i understood that that was what you decided but if it wasn 't will change that we would maintain machines we 're not but not put them into group not now but you said if they put them in your intern your maintain oh is that the other ones on it launched those only come there on council land so I called a lot workers we should be encouraging yeah I my help mr. that were made in regards of funding rate increases we 've got comments along the line i 'm not going to be shot down counselors decided not to make further adapted to it pop up to its operational budget from my point of view i don 't think we really got the chance so i find it that 's the document said at the rate payer or the public have the right to read and I come back to my concern about procedure we were given notification that would have three meetings to do with the annual plan one on the tween here and the 27th of februari they took four and a half hours at the conclusion of the twenty-fourth of everyone i said when are we gonna look at cutting costs on the 7th of march was to be a day to do with the exact wording sign off the young sign off the in your plan the data that bet meeting ever took place finalize the drafter in your pain civil so much if you ever took place we then got to the stage of doing the i think it was five days to have taken off not via council resolution i believe that we preach the format of what we should have been doing in the end along to implant and the annual plan so from my point of view i 'm very disappointed that we did not look at reducing the rate increases forum for this coming 1415 year through the chair after the febri workshops the offer was made to all councillors that we would have one-on-one sessions with them to go through whatever concerns ahead on the finances line by line three councillors count as Harvey Jones and Williamson all took us up on the offer and counselor body did not we can only offer whether that offer is accepted or not doesn 't answer my question your worship in regards of not having that final meeting on the seventh match to finalize the draft annual plan the questions or queries ok we 're going to suggested resolution Leah and suggest an amendment that the amended decisions reporting yeah that means it slightly you 're in there and did I have a move canceled back yep all those in favor please say aye those against characters item number nine and certain fees under the local government act and to set the fees for the next year some fees have to go through the special consultative procedure which is why we put them in this document because that takes the same special consultative procedure and some don 't these are the fees that don 't have to go through this procedure and essentially you can see from the attached attachment to the agenda item what the differences between those fees for this current financial year and the financial year that starts on the first of July so you 'll see that the majority of them haven 't changed the ones that have are the cemetery fees and and they have changed to be in line with other councils a number of years ago they were compared with other councils can it was seen as were quite a bit lower and so over the years we 've been trying to raise them slowly rather than in one big jump to make them more in line are on page nine by nine the gray lake center fees before East Wing fee has changed because that 's been assessed against similar venues in Rotorua and seem to be not charged quite at the right rate and also for the full day for the community use of the hall east wing because it 's a bigger venue than the normal Hall it should be charged at a greater rate and then the kitchen fees of increase just slightly to have a pap power consumption and then on the next page 9 x 10 research beef at the top of museums now but more flexible you don 't just charge forty dollars it depends on how long you 're doing that for search and then on nine bar 12 is a slight change in the laguna request for information fees under corporate services the second one down there and that 's because our policy says it will be thirty-eight dollars so we can 't charge 39 we have to charge 38 sorry through chimp calf we should you I 'm sorry just going up to the housing for the 's gone up ten dollars and I 'm just wondering say that says say double under say under two don 't need double units it 's got ninety dollars plus 45 a week I 'm just wondering what 's the plus 45 and is the past 35 gone up all the 90 I 'm interested thing I don 't know if this gets printed in anything official better than the boy Mathis wrong a on the under corporate face yes yes LG oh I heroes or USS and the last change which is tiny I 'm just on 9 by 13 and there 's a new fee introduced to put your property file on CD as people didn 't do them in the past there sorry that 's the end I 'm just going to steak and I 'll shoot myself in the 40s sorry Rosie as well you we can access of real estate agents we can access property file online now and we can download the link and we get that free of charge I thankfully should be charging for that as real estate agents we 'd pay and information New Zealand and I think that we should looking at making charge off that for real estate agents because from a commercial point of view for us is highly beneficial so as much as I 'm shoot myself in the foot away we 're making some money you just can 't medicine here but I finished me some initiative up there like to submit to the quite happy to take like a famous yeah we download about two hundred a year or three hundred years I think that is can you do there the fever 's behind her was that was that previously it was a manual transaction they took our staff time some of our trying to encourage people to use their system which saved us money so there 's why they were ever been charged but it 's quite a long time to keep saying it 's about a long-term plan definitely something all these fees again will be up for discussion and I think going back a step from there before you start off in your face the the level of service so what do a use of charges or a general rain the experts at a fee at the end of it so that 's all up for the LTP so some people actually abusing their profile online rather than getting a full of costs the other end if we don 't cancel javi and just three say that the you going to possibly increase Great Lakes enter charges etc have groups who use these facilities being consulted on with the only of these increases and not particularly no and the big commercial events and lover we 've really been quoting for the next year so we 've been doing them both lots and but for those big ones to be honest that 's not going to make a difference and the community events are generally won 't off so they 're generally the war could be a rink or a regular but one off you know the ballet company that comes in every year as long as they know in advance of bothering I 'll be charged they then got then on to their fee structures it still be very competitive charging both you look good likewise you don 't like venues around the place this wouldn 't like to see us put our fees up to the detriment of yep getting you know patronage etc when times are but you know title so on we 're pretty reasonable when it comes to people talking to us and hanging remnant okay okay Jonas if you worship am so just a question on housing for the elderly five dollars a week doesn 't seem a lot but times it by for have we changed to our residents as this in line with other rental increases because this is all on CPI even though I hear you saying in line with other counsel fees can we just have a bit of a chat about what 's happening here can I just give you what 's happening in Christchurch a single unit feed unit in Christchurch is going from one hundred dollars per week to one hundred and thirty-six dollars okay and this isn 't that there was some time ago in then he 's going way back i 'm afraid but there isn 't a a year and i 've appeared a time i 'm sort of coming to the end of that now but I want to assure you that that this is covered by the accommodation supplement so working income cover most if not all of this this cost and if you look at comparative private rentals this is way below what the commercial jet setter would offer i would suggest she was the last last thing sorry and what is a street name plate and that 's a sign but he 's by knows is that we charge developers is it so know about putting food vans on the bottom so that other road sideways a hot seller slain cousin ad but maybe it 's like the car if I mean I in Boots water free ok so just resolution Aaliyah kind of a professional oh thanks council Williamson kiss scene right now sir Don 's always in favor please say aye my nose against Kerry just SAT adjourn for five minutes sister and have a bit of a bit started thinking _"

Fox you can hear that all right any questions for us was the Fox beautification of dock 652 they so and when the two particular wasn 't negotiations with the other agencies public there was some discussion around the liability issues at one point in those negotiations doc had offered to act as the bank and meet those liabilities they then had further discussions around that and memory serves me right mr. Williams they withdrew that offering yes so through we might get earth and we got half so we we we came out with the negotiation with an expected position rather than one that we didn 't really want he ever questions so again they cut some of John 's through the chair Thank You mr. wish you worship just a question for mr. Fox is there any likelihood that the steering committee will go away from the recommendation of a hybrid model to one of the other two options are highlighted in your paper through mr. to my understanding is that the more letters approved by the you wanted signed and the budgets that are associated with we sit for five years off upon boomers thanks I can 't_''_146.56 I don 't speak as to whether steering committee or and you were might decide in the future but that 's the initial understanding that 's already sent to the things the folks there were the options obviously obviously with the risks the teams of ability of disengagement snotty key mentioned there 's a disadvantaged youth in the experience this is the real be relevant for real circus in that 's a risk we have it all all times so I don 't see it as a a new risk it 's a hazer that 's always the and with volunteers will always be there with the smaller we be sharing that risk to a greater extent with a new agency other partners we 're going to thank you mr. foxxie okay you have a question aquarius cancer jonathan kvm the reservation Thank You cancer don 't signify just life doesn 't_''_208.739 are tremendously thank you all those in favor please say life is against area item number 7 59 too fatty tower street disposal discussion romarin fish nice to see here and okay I think before we start we 'll start with the mistakes first to serve open it out and I 'm sure you probably picked that work in terms of option to the first line and there 's an advantage and disadvantage and they were supposed to be altered to be there obviously what they actually say so with advantage advantages I know Amy Morrison pops say happy movie lust so please forgive me for this has advantages and disadvantages one of them sees annual maintenance cost estimated at five thousand dollars it 's not applicable once you sell the site obviously it 's no annual maintenance costs and the other one you would obviously balloon the campout is so parking lot of net and if it 's a lot of yourself take the item is region this is your summarizing de for its decisions and you 'd be made and hopefully we 've covered off the two options that were consulted with and you met the option fit and for my understanding from leg expected to be the decision needs a good night so which person should be televised okay all right just reading human I 'm i got my grumpy pants on today but I just for you three advisors and Savannah 's as a both option one option 2 i 'm gonna say I 'm but consumed like this is an example for not too sure who writes easel might have been youthful we go to option 2 and you 've got reduce debt levels 1.2 million available value one-off need to cut need to service debt they are the same thing actually not it 's the interest on the deep so yes of course you 're getting rid of it you 're racing 1.2 million so maybe maybe you could say that that was the cast but I what happened with this was I hadn 't thought about the interest sector of having the 1.2 million dollars sitting near we 've obviously got to pay the interest on a deed and so that was an added bonus i think i was listening fun of his finishes during the discussions and they said i would look this interest on you know deep it so it was reasonable turn your attorney so that 's why that 's a mirror net forum indirectly by that you 've got developing paying rates that will pay eight thousand dollars ourselves right that 's just a column echange a frame from there put a Grenadier no money changes hands for us correct no Wendy put a development on its own no but that was to be sold yeah those commands we wouldn 't be paying it anymore that a moment brain I did a couple of advantages of we if we retain this is the advantage that I 've got which ad and there was another concern and I suppose the council doesn 't shouldn 't really think it too much about commercial viability for the existing businesses but couple the advantages I soil retention word the ongoing beneficial economic use for local businesses there should be an advantage of kicking up long-term financial gain from the asset which we 're in the west part of the markets the markets only going to improve so the edges can be whittled for us limits long to maintaining the integrity of the CBD and light of current economic downturn and that 's not populating the property CBD with buildings that we can 't rent and also and it can be taken two ways with us that we keep in line with current counter policy to me those should have been in there and the Holy just over sides but I 'm just think I get the impression asst of I feel rly nin one way that 's what fuels me I as counsel as you 're entitled to log to disagree to add in your own mind when you line up decisions the item in front of you as council officers use and that 's when we 've taken everything into account while it all up we 've put the visor disadvantage for you as we see them in a street says as we see them you may have a completely different set of of considerations and that 's absolutely fine as your elected to the position to make those decisions we 're employed here to give you our view the system in our view and this is not my guinea adjust these things I 've just friends from both room 1 i 've gotten them down there yeah they will be in here because the the economic benefit for the community as i said just some people here they were not that I drove past year 8 30 of night and the fifth car park was packed with people and I couldn 't get a car park to grand buy some food to end up going to KFC know loved it from the economic standpoint to the existing businesses that have this benefiting them and I just a big player i would like to see me sorry yes that that 's probably a valid point and I guess I was looking at it in terms of in our suing the evaluation and noting that obviously Q Street which is pretty much one street away it 's pretty much empty at the time at which you 're talking about and so the distance that you 're talking talk and it didn 't seem like a see I 'm lazy I drove round the corner okay see and so that sort of value you Sarah it would be an impact expect immediate car that being in fact there are some other opportunities and so it 's for Harvey and and I thought during our deliberations we had actually decided that we were going to change our resolution so this is where I 'm also a little bit confused and I thought that we had decided we weren 't going to sell it but we also weren 't gonna do option two were going to put it on hold and we were going to revisit it so this is where I 'm a little bit confused with this if you we can only bring back to you what went out I think legal advice now right there you are in the position to very change whatever ball because that was what was consulted on that was what we are quite right I can cancel struck eyes under the same impression is rosy and that we were going to put the way through and that we were just going to look at the potholes that might need fixing there and not do anything major and not sell it at this point in time actually we 're on that subject expert on can sister what are the implications if we don 't put the walkway through do you mind giving us those we went out for consultation with walkway in both options so the focus energy business casual a new agenda walkway and we 're possibly leaving ourselves slightly vulnerable time we go one step further then yeah and you as a council have at some stage lessen your sass with what you need to do through your long-term plan process regardless of the well if the decision doesn 't to sell what you need through your long-term plan process they decide where our winner bouts for them their 10-year period you allow for the development of that walkway and how much their development toes but you can do that as part of your long-term plan process it 's then if you don 't do that well then at some stage and River Commerce is when joining property owners have a investment decisions based on your adopted council policy which has to have a walkway through the middle that they could take challenge at that because they 've made investment decisions based on your dr kossoff visit you wish you could I just feel funny hair actually then these is that we knew such 10 years now 10 years from adoption so you another there are 20 21 22 wrong don 't_''_700.55 we go back there so I think one source with a court simply you worship the instance of the walkway doesn 't adopted council policy and what you haven 't done yet is funded it in this because and their Council dr. policy that says that obvious medium to that talks about the medium term the language would be that you need to consider that as part of your OTP when they 're funding comes up so you 're going to have to do that whether the next 12 months can set up when the next ten years you fund that if you don 't then you you too Aaron serious ability for judicial review an issue change the plan would require going back to the start of all of us back through their money into a process it would just come out just across kasi then heckling them in cousins Angelyn within william significant back because I presence dude it effect that I wasn 't part of deliberations and maybe doubling up on it but my first question that arises is if we were to sell the other site and then add the owner were to own both the car pack and the adjacent side what could the owner build on and over that always a three-dimensional so it could conceivably conceivably be a three-story restaurant or hotel which would require presumably some cap aking requires no you 're not the kind of supply nothing i 'm guessing on cats laughing oh yeah i think during their discussions we we don 't again want to close the door on this I don 't think anyway and and if we 're not careful the information that was given to his Dorian discussions was if we don 't sell it then when we do want to sell it in reps two years time or whenever then we have to go through back through all the process of of handing back and that 's where I up real difficulty because it 's taken us almost 18 months to get to this point so yes I could but that 's my understanding at the moment and odd solicitude like the opportunity to probably evening tweet suggested number one resolution when it 's the appropriate time guess the cousins how do i get into you think that 's along some if you just make the gas the and the discipline assist those say doesn 't necessarily given like a time constraint except 20 years incremental in over 20 years so the second part is that has been any obligation to do that with respect to the development front with the roberts to Leinster there 's have been indication that would be done like so again and the plan i think it talks about your site of them public ed about medium to and so there 's up to that 20 years i was talking long terms of 20 years plus and that 's what i 'm saying as they lgp would be the time that you have their discussion if you didn 't set up you have their discussion about about when you were weaned and how much you allowed for them I 'm the discussions with the front men owner of idea being but watch and the plan stronger plan which is that the walkway ball we provide through the site and the medium-term slur cousins wants to cancel the heckling some comment about you know closing the door well I thought we make a are making a commitment to retain it not saying next year two years the previous council mayor made a decision to sell it but um we 're devoting the two issues surely which is so or not so zealous right so if we vote to keep then I don 't see why we need to put a back door policy anything we 're going to sell in the future I think okay so i 'm saying i don 't want door closed totally and option to the key we can say that actually first thing but we can sell it in the future we still go through the process again the trailer which is what which is lonely and you could lose it these what sorry you could lose the because you have to hand it back to the original own near my dad at market value yeah and this play once per churches which will still be on the win no your co stone you wouldn 't be able to get a walkway through well because the policies dictates what they 're going to be able to build before will resent of looking pretty for Roberts only liver buys it has to make allocations the walkway so there 's me there was a lisbon through the site I guess inside a walkway up would be protected of it so I guess the the issue is the concern is is that from what we heard through the through the submission process and from from Chrissy mcelwee as an example saying don 't sell until they adjoin site goes because then you do the whole but is a is a block I guess from what I 'm you know from the counselor sane and then it does a real risk is that really you need to be aware of is then if you saved me you 're not going to sell it now then whenever that happens be at two years of five years or ten years time you have to start and go back through that process now that provides a time and an expense but i 'll be more risky as that the the owner that you then have to offer a bag to could look at that if site could look at that and say I 'm going to take their profit out of this so they could take the offer back by off you at market value at their time and then sell it for a profit to the person who wants to do the development or stifle the belden put their own little whatever and they wish good call though that 's really what I wanna dates that it was one but I 'm just explaining next the breast which you need to be aware of when you 're making or to say at this stage we can determine the future other we can dictate who actually visor and we have some roosevelt take advice well we go on me we can have some planning rules around it you know so it 's wish a lot rather than dealing with someone you don 't know you wish or should move emotion industrial resolution this regard you know read we do not feel the 250 sprint car packed in any further any future development of the site will be considered as part of the 10-year plan process running to like what 's the general feeling I think we on the table is that as the deputy mirrors said we don 't want to close the door forever on this and I think you guys not be there yeah and I think you 're right there and you wish but we look at the draft annual plan that 's currently on our discs that refuse to retaining ownership and reviewing it under the long-term plan is that correct wording that same kinda mirror is based on the look double deliberations discussion excuse me and obviously the decision why this is before that particular you wish if I need a thickener being moved and seconded okay now I just want a clarification here does this close it or not concerned of the wedding so I was just going to say can you please repeat it for weeks like it sorry especially one stop giving us the ended with staff we do not sell the tap 24 at a street car park at this time in any future development of the site will be considered as part of the 10-year buried yeah would that mean that we didn 't have to go back through the Public Works Act or the contractual offer back should the council have an option for selling the site at some stage in future there is that risk I suppose there 's two ways of not closing the door one is to say no but we 'll review it and the other one is to say yes but not now now in terms of going there the risk of going back through that happen you go back to the processes risk of challenge yes but not now is less risky then no but we 'll review it later in terms of in terms of those risks can slightly as I read it this the motion that 's been suggested as a no but we 'll review it which has here 's those greater risks that aleve the Gulf recover and we went out on on two options more of the implications if we choose there 's a different option chosen out of there just in terms of the decision making in future legal personally it won is option an option that is option one but through the consideration is to win and how is put off is less risky in terms of challenge then an option that says no but we 'll review it later just in terms of that due to the rest of i can 't_''_1315.47 say that i can say that either of them either any modification modified option is doesn 't_''_1322.46 if some risk because what you consulted on was these two options in the estat forms in any modification there there some risks but a version of option one levers win in my view is less risky them option two but reviewing that could be that the wind could be deferred to be okay calcitonin casa heckling I it was cannot not quite sure a procedure yet not quite sure a procedure here you wish it yeah but I I 've got an alteration to option one but I would like to put you 've already got a move on a seat 11 or so can I have some clarifications you 've gotta move in a second that you could amend a calf injury contrast to the resolution and otherwise that resolution if we put end result in the loss walkera sorry to keep can we not totally moment or two to the option one node you have here this one this one 's ready okay through how do you wish it what what what council hope clean could what your worship could have is that counselor heckling might indicate the wording of is resolution that might come up business resolution was for instance lost so rather than the meaning in saying this is what I might be putting up yep okay I 'll come back to you in a minute a counseling I just cancelled OMG just run setup sorry i was gonna say won 't we vote on suggested motion football by council of audience see where we said okay just before we do then i 'll just go back to council had claimed just two eps am give us an idea what he was intending you wish i order you can typically move something every first two weighing cetera it 's not it 's the UH not on that piece is talking still talking signers I have moved very very clear doesn 't mean nature walk waste time in whatever it just says a long to clean yep so tell about we just said I am cuz I 'm one either you worship I just made this as an alternative suggestion it 's the castle defer the sale of 2090 photostream for a period of 12 months and in further investigation into market interest and opportunities with adjoining property owners okay okay we 'll go back to the Gopher Christos be there is still a third option that no one has considered and clearly seeing that such a division it which warrants further debate you could actually defer the items well you haven 't_''_1525.36 got the minutes of the deliberations to refer to and I certainly can 't comment on the under minutes or what was deliberated on and it quite clearly states in here council may also wish to consider the ability to retain some flexibility in the future where ownership is retained in the short term etc etc none of that has been explained nor has which ever approach is utilized for this property could be seen as setting a precedent for any future decisions relating to cafe as they 've been debated I rest my case okay on the table it 's been moved and seconded and does anyone else want to talk to the resolution well the resource to you just repeat the resolution again please government we do not feel the 250 street car park any future development of the site will be considered as part of the 10-year plan process as on the last week I just like to speak to it and i quote lots of the last four seasons you 've got the last word socials whether there 's other seen anyone else I talked to the resolution for the resolution for or against or or against the resolution okay why don 't we while the council identified option one selling the site is a preferred choice when you an hour for consultation one submissions we considered the council decided that the site should be retained any further development Cyrus my case right moved and seconded i put the motion it because i get the motion whereas in favor could I have a show of hands please okay those against motion is lost thank you would you like to go now I 've put suggested alteration to option one you worship and I 'll read it out the council d fears the sale of 29 to photostream for a period of 12 months and in further investigation into market interest and opportunities with adjoining property owners in that resolution and I 'll move that resolution yes I can still pack died you wanted to speak for the motion or against I 'll ask a question so that 's good if we go with this version and it 's got a time frame the near of 12 months doesn 't mean we have to sell it after 12 months or I can not space dandy and it can keep going out now whatever the market is saying could come back to you for this project but I just like to say the reason Everlast say yes Lorenzo which refers back to rob this food with respect both those office you may the bubble work second that the bottle of digital boy back to the previous owner was different in I can 't_''_1730.669 be completely it 's not black and white horse a deferral of 12 months is less risky than a no for instance and respected having to go back to the public worked at the longer you defer the rape is a recipe however on the other side in terms of the value well we know we 've gone past the public the offer back has happened so I hope in it so if you keep the fearing it out of the 12 months for the next five years that would come up point when a court might say you you get the very end along effectively excited not sell it in fact I think the risk of that happening in a 12-month girl is not I think thanks Rob thanks chema and okay it 's been moved again cycling singer to buy counselor pack show hand please for all those umpires specially or did you wanna say something or I was only going to put the reason I and out as far as I 'm conceived to talk about the disposal it right time and it might be a right time in another trophy we don 't matter we fabulous lean just a clarification to Simba oh and your night fresh about them person that the legal action prior he was not a person that submitted the owner of the site was the party who made the legal threat of legal within you thank you yeah so let 's compare must be changed okay so here is ocean the air mass because an avid sorry can we sell it before sorry we couldn 't do it I don 't know could ever come back you can 't_''_1879.93 hit them right okay all right show of hands please those in favor Barry 's resolution yep those against okay the motion is carried thank you wish upon that door acacia same emotion has been carried it will protect the heart of walkway under will place where y0 salmon river there 's a laser _"

    "text": "think we might have to residents about item 15 or 16 traffic comments of a metaphor because I think they 've made an effort to get here absolute and George would you like I 'm just trying to see whether the mayor would like would bring your item forward what to do that you 're sure to allow you to be involved with this item item number 15 which is regarding the lake terrace traffic calming we have mr. Lewis please engineer and we do have a government members of the public here we must to see if you like it you 're most welcome to come a little bit forward if you want to just embraces any queries of 50 notification good I think you 've runs being circulated reading the information and I 've also email with some additional information from mr. Dustin that that arrived on the on my laptop school counselors when we ran Scott that thanks Pierce have you could take it away on this one place you should worship at the last council meeting are presented a report recommending acceptance of the tender that for the week was proposed in that report and I 've gone through the files of the text information relating the background to that starting off with the council I think was a TK MP receiving a petition against them everyone 's been privy to their previous information have you any queries of Christians relating to let information can surpass us p I have some of the information that has been provided for was before the ETA became operative therefore do some of the assumptions that were made in those documents still apply to a day some of there was one of them it was a discussion about the amount of traffic changes options may worship listed am I correct in understanding that if the status quo where to remain and council took ownership of the road NZTA would still have a control over the speed limits through the speed limit sitting closest please think of us need to go back to the april verification we went through that process last time speed limit by the one they still have the opportunity to cancel body we wish i 'm just has changed this goes back in probably what what I 'd find easier maybe if this could actually address the issue then we can discuss some of the facts and figures that be the best way to do it you wouldn 't sure so if I guess because sorry so this is your name is George yes you have told you you 're obviously a resident Europe been party to this for a long time Uribe coddled by right there which is a volume of traffic after employment the Spirit is supplements really aimed how do you mind if the counselors ask any questions in particular or anything like that did you want to ask anybody off I did you wish because it 's a start off please so mr. Lewis Jim comment has we 've made about traffic flows in the ETA I have a letter here from a mr. Allen Birkett who is the principal s advantage I think that trans in one of your lost courting cells it 's difficult to buy they could data on traffic flows on sections of highways that starter is collected only flow and state highway 1 pre ETA was about eleven thousand eight hundred vehicles and post ETA five thousand record crashes between firewalker and two morro bay from 209 to mid 12 or one series five minor and 89 injury if we then turn to the documentation that is in our agenda items is also another letter from mr. Burkitt talking about the speed limits and breaches in the meanest leads are all about season in percentages incarcerated enemies or i guess a challenge which I just had a couple of questions for you um what I mean and this is not a scientific thing at all but what sort of how over the speed limit are those cars going through what do you think well it 's it 's hard to judge they got well we 're going to see the speed cameras up there for the street recorded ready to roll nope they just threw out ahead they come up the hill they left one in your personal view do you think a speed camera would be a deterrent possibly would be put Wendy idea somos el viernes see the song they 're gone I just like to commit the accounts of Johnson it 's not so much and they are exceeding the speed limit its that at the moment that section of highway has got a variable speed limit so from the 20th the December to 13th of februari it 's 50 k I mean from the first you thursday before easter to the last Tuesday no sorry that lastly is they before Easter to the first tuesday after he stated is 50k for overtimes of the year at seven DK so the proposal was to reduce the speed limit permanently 250k and to achieve that was implementing some physical measures cancel heckling yes thank you you wish it okays could you just explain i mean i think i 'm aware how long does it take for transit New Zealand to accept that there is a possible safety issue on some of our roads because at least they have funding this project fifty-three percent say in a faint now we 've got it down to a more acceptable level of 140 hundred and fifty thousand for the costs in the council probably sixty to sixty-five thousand two to carry out this week and and I know the process to get transit New Zealand to accept but there is a safety issue and this is documentation here but this is taken as what almost ten years to get to this particular point I can 't answer that sorry because it 's the painted entirely on the safety issue that you 're talking about end yeah what the details of that particular area are it 's so so from your point of view as our traffic engineer you do perceive there is a safety issue with AB stretch of road there is an issue with speeding in pedestrian if the desire is to permanently reduce the speed limit 50 kilometers an hour in you need to do something other than just change the speed business ok mix handy that 's present for your human and mr. Lewis just I suppose what Budhia was supposed to statement and my time assists recording things right now and last 10 years we 've had a child killed on the tap on the killed him whiter Hundley he had a child about 15 years ago go kill them on the main road in here Plus this one and two thousand and three are we suggesting that perhaps we can slow Trevor down each of these places please one of incidences because that 's what we 're asking I 'm not suggesting then I just concerned that we will be looking at all what could be real trouble trouble spots or rent places receiving this information at the moment so i think possibly i think george thank you for coming and mms versa obviously debate the actual exposure later on and but you know it has been gone a long time a lot of business and make submissions over the years and i think again you know baby to take notice of those submissions that you know you 've been a long campaign for georgia given your demo people when you 've got out made this campaign you 've got out and under work but i 've got injured ta involved we 've got I got the various agency so I think we need purple debated but later on and as far as actual cost of its concern so you wish you can I just make a comic certainly is a resident I appreciate you coming here today I 'm clearly not doing anything in regards I would like to do something in the regards of looking at speed limits I 've already heard froakie counselor over there that it hasn 't really won 't change until the NTA do something mr. Lewis you made a comment that you perceive the right to be dangerous in our mullets i think it is orange previous meeting we suggested we get interested parties together proving the residents and the police do you have any documentation then in the last 18 months for two years the local traffic patrols have actually indicators of this council extra per road is a problem firstly caliber didn 't say that the road was dangerously what I 'm food you were getting well actually 18 months or two years ago in this came across an organization I was working with I approached into the police in town they had no issues complaints from anyone at all so I visited them this morning unfortunately the officer in concern ahead officer was not available and the only indication i got from the ones i talked to was they didn 't perceive an issue now that started writing i 'm just telling you that and i think that 's quite an important part if that road is a problem for the law enforcement two things can happen one we can change the speed limit and be we can put patrol cars early okay thank you i move that we received information relating to those tears tears I 'm sigma pi kapps to come thank you thank you George thanks Dennis all those in favor please say aye those against Kerry okay we 'll go back to item number five sessions ice on lake terrace viewing platforms vanilla and so the suggestive resolution put forward to you today is consistent with the majority opinion expressed by publix meadows during a new plane process there those that expressions of interest for the commercial occupation of the sites should not be sought in line reverse the report or licensing of the sites i declined on the basis that the reserve measurement plan does not provide for the activity and net this council does not support from the leasing and licensing of the sites for commercial operators just just for clarity and again you know four hits of deliberations and I for um sort of businesses sitting up there with that have here on a daily basis but I thought that we had a discussion around if there was specific sort of district celebrations or V to do with the rapid or such like that people could make application application that would then go to the red committee for consideration I wasn 't answer wasn 't of the mind that we were absolutely did against thing better nothing so three mr. chairman again acid n white I shall say well so you 're discussing and debating that right now you could move an amended resolution if you wished which allowed up for one-off events or to go to freedom the free committee or whatever else you wanted the sustained line item standalone debate Novak 's car that 's hi sweetie miss Rises out of the confusion which leads us back to what we say about item three what a fool was that confusion after that no minutes refuted yeah well I remember you you worship suggesting that an option you know it 's probably will be budgeted deal okay we can we can obviously seen the submissions come and we know the submissions so we can actually have the debate near as well I suppose again we want a so Gossage on yeah thank you worship just through the chair maybe um must agree might be able to clarify this if we don 't go ahead with commercial items it 's reserved which means that the reserve Management Act applies for events so is that correct over and the Reserve Act would apply babe you 've got a specific resolution for post here which is basically saying when someone puts an application and it will be declined on the basis of this discussion and user bedroom faith so um so including me they would include events you could change that resolution to talk about I changing the preservative discretion of counsel what if you want a little bit that 's likely yeah think that we 've closed the door tightly on this we worship and these two resolutions basically do have I would consider that I wouldn 't like to see permanent severe at all and the submissions pretty much told is that but certainly a one-off to do with either the Europe festival or I a man or any of those large events but I wouldn 't like to see the door closed on those what it means we 've got to have a minor change to the management and if I can just comment on the events aspect of the Yosef website so with the events and they simply a Boche they booked the reserve and then if there 's a commercial operator that 's kind of ancillary to their event in their permitted to operate there and so that would be the case for those sites so as officers but assists the event and what the commercial operation is if it 's closely related to the event than we could actually permit that but if to come through the food committee and for specific permission we could put that in the resolution said otherwise the status quo would be that we could have match the occupation for one-off events I think the general feeling here is Ella that we don 't know classical dance young New Zealand string orchestra won 't even come along and have a you know someone can buy a coffee whether watching the August or something like that I so we don 't my name is the life you say whether you can go into peps work out a little resolution there they 're the things i think that the resolution refers to kind of a long term lacing a licensing of the sites and it doesn 't restrict our burrito allow commercial operators there during events if they 've connected to the event and then i guess for worship that was the point I was making sorry sorry Gareth was my understanding as it doesn 't really test from doing that I 'd like to see a bit more clarified his social itt my be able to load vehicle after the exception of specific one offer means I think you wish you would have to deal with band first which I 'm prepared to move thinking that we shipped us before just you know just done the policy implication that dosto racial reserve mentions playing will need to be mere to provide for this even for the M during events season policy implications exactly that I daresay on the other Pegasus only full run but for the commercial threads when a long-term basis would neither your change the reserve management plane but not for them I 'm of the visible in the 470 Shane hearsay and applause it needs to be changed the ravines because say I say I remember i 'm writing there but then having discussion with my timing in and chat obviously forgot to change their part yeah FX map the policy implication water and one how about if number toe could be amended and to specify long-term so future applications received for long-term leases or licenses I think 10 10 finally we move on to two other way from VN you better than secrets first one moved by Councillor body and secure broadcaster cousins so all those in favor on that I am okay we have a new number two that opens the door slightly for one-off occasions or good offers for possible yeah usage for event based activities so your worship I just off just good got an Escher honest I don 't_''_1253.37 I think we just need to clarify because i don 't i don 't want to see mr. whippy there because we 've got something happening i will affect something unique in death than towards a part of a festival or something alive sort of along those lines i 've got no problem with it but I don 't want to see a coffee Kathy I don 't want to see us to up in here I don 't what a state commercial operators there at all just things that are pertains between particular weeks that enhance anatomical really simple to just an invasive script to in stick with what you 've just wrote and resolved and then if there 's something off the cuff of you something interesting what you just to freed or someone else to have their discussion so if we just get rid of two all together just you really rode up and I just so obviously yeah thnkx changing and then you 've got someone come and say look at that nice person free reception with a really neat idea is general laziness yes I just saw route to hear so a lot of area do you not think number one just needs to minor adjustment to allow one on through Fred application don 't that your kids has been moved and security first it 's raining so I 'm suggest you to move you could live another one ideally but I 'll say you don 't have to well I think you 're right we should be number two districts like tweaking to allow applications to be seen by the pre committee yeah been through you and business human I think this how was live last time that 's what Gareth said because you wanted to have that put a mirror and comes true Gareth must have mentioned at that time that there was no need five bit resolution that 's how it was left so number two possible one off and without number two you already have a process but it allowed for so you don 't actually wait to tell people that you have a process to be able to do that because it 's already in the reserve will accrue plan process you just saying that you 're not going out some white for expressions of interest at this time in any worship both just passing this first one with very clearly sending out to the community that we listen to them and we are particularly integrity of their site so just to clarify if I do receive a notification and for occupation of the sites say during events and council would prefer sort of application to be received by the free committee okay well don 't even know spelling mistakes and obviously you can I just clarify house before Christians I 've been waiting like being around Karate with nordley just yet you make more noise it may just it may be someone that wants to occupy it for longer than an over a few weeks during the summer we wouldn 't discount that would work so we can there be other freedom right okay we just want to make sure it 's not just one of this I just one day there for ya close if not closing the door we don 't shy away from entrepreneurship yeah there 's only thing of us district and someone that wants to be there for a few weeks I know your name your mother Ellen so um thank you I 'll stop waving that we 're still

Ritson actually here at the moment and whether you wanted to give us just a quick update on the bike fam if I have mr. red we 've had a query here regarding this resolution yes so I 'm Richard bomb

sequester I 'll painting the council of bodies alluding to that do we need to have a new resolution come forward of the paper the next meeting to Justin times there are a few very few thinnest and you wish up to page 91 bar teen in regards for the clinical height height stage three through the cheer these are the minutes of the safety committee at the alert and they are treated and confidence because of the possibility of misinterpretation of some of the comments made within the minutes once again if it 's to do with the interpretation of some of i dont preach confidence and discussed outside Nikki okay counselor John 's just to support misdemeanants coming I sit on the sofa vehicle authority and I 'm quite confident that these minutes of Hell in the right reasons and confidently willington okay suggested resolution either we move back its but I the move please councillor pack singer by council heckling thank you all those in favor please say aye I as against Gary okay item number two receipt of the minutes fences reserves dogs committee manga key Nepal Connie representative group emergency management committee and the local airport authority committee you have any questions or queries on these minutes typos or and yeah I know it 's just for safe the minutes but I 'm too bad 23 I 'm item number three it has me moving a resolution but I was actually in Hamilton that day so I wasn 't able to attend that meeting Thank You calcified somebody military wish of godiva counselor jolons what 's the status of international arrivals at people once I those discussions with a separate building might need to be provided for S&T hello meeting last tuesday at the Ministry of prawn industries who and judged the glove arrival they 're not interested in planes flying out very interested in planes fly again I oh security perspective and they are processing the applications and these 15 airports in New Zealand that have the license and are looking at trying to reduce it by giving consideration in the meantime we have had two flights in the last 12 months into the airport I asked them what would happen if we the third one and they said the you need a license for frequent flights the definition of frequent flights was any flight numbers greater than one so it 's an ongoing battle in that regard so nothing will be done of a building or capital nature at the airport until confirmation or otherwise as regards the license is received Castle heckling yeah there is a recommendation from the sensors and reserves and dog committees on page 2 bar 10 parking on an item problem you can do an agenda diversion this is adoption nutrient vegetation cover and furthermore what potential ramifications that may have last Tuesday yes they are still looking at offloading their interest and regional airport nothing will be happening the side of the election and even then there 's a lot of questions to be answered so i would say that we 're not the first cab off the rank of the stage looks like being new plants being the first so it 's going to take a period of time presumably long-term plan I do indicate to them that the council would be interested in buying their half share for a dollar so i 'm sure we can feel that the bodies regards to the immediate and management committee minutes and regards the aladdin or fiber and once the fox may be able to answer the second paragraph up from the bottom on tues bar 19 states that direction will be taken from outside our area how confidence is just a fox or others that when an emergency call is made that the area will be not dependences in the past we emergency services on the wrong direction so is that something that needs to be looked at when we us to cheer I think that refers to the direction in terms of the regional nature of this new entity yeah terms of local responses we will still have our local operations receiving as a reason to call out so that the direction is more of a regional nature and that 's what the paragraph is general if you don 't think you never questions or queries okay okay there 's a suggested resolution the air and move those on block I have a move please thanks counselor jolliness signature by councillor heckling thank you will raise in favor please say aye against carried okay item number three chief executive report thank you your worship yes without the item is from red and it 's a cinder version of a minute chief executives reporters we have staff busily preparing we 're on your report at this point in time which will be circulated to you and hope you an excellent month or so and so any questions having to take just a symbol of direction obviously it 's an election year the same amount of politicking around at this time debated and discussed in the papers from a regional perspective from total district councils perspective it 's business as usual where I will stay well engaged with both about 20 in the waikato we are not getting them heard and the the various elements at the politics but we 're staying close so that we can make big decisions to you as and when we 're we 're required to other than that of just free to answer questions cousins for you tyranny just my benefit oh I wasn 't here five last council I lookin all the figures that you 've got here with I 'm sure give me all measures up for me I 've got my basis on which to judge what this is good or bad I would like to see to have a benchmark against last year 's the same time I don 't know how much worse involved negative is too much work please tell me but I 'd like to see what how we track against last year to see how well we 're doing something any business would want to do that surely you have it on record anyway there to be part of this but maybe you could email it to councillors so we hit this to come here because i 'd like to see how we track guilt this is flight 800 think about what we can do that try and help out i would say as a globe from a global perspective one of the figures that stood out to me was let 's let 's put the fifty three percent complete on Catholics program for up for this 11 months we 've had a focus this year on possibly pushing projects further arch to reduce the financial impacts of those projects on council where as in previous years where we had the major projects and programs in place that we needed to deliver we would have been upwards of eighty five percent at this point in time so although that figure could be viewed as a negative from our perspective as management it 's almost for the management decision to sort of push projects as well over out as as much as we could bear in mind that waiting for resource consent processes or other elements of the projects to work but i 'll ever think about your not sort of guidance we can give you another book is that trains i supposed to see encounter eases expenditure and where we spend more money or where we 're making my vista see how we 're trekking so we have a better understanding a bit is that pretty clear you know ok thanks ok thanks counselor claim hungry absa see a question to the CEO when do anticipate the roadmap 10-year plan see that girl over water we think that we discussed and yep blocking some days absolutely work we will desperately came to see that road work as well for get fed up with the latest updates from two to three weeks and we 'll have that road map or animation yep okay i guess the christine merrill for amazing down your hair to rise to sunbury nine if you have any details on it but i was so yep okay all right any other questions or queries of chief executive well you worship we raise the game not quite sure where we are with it is some councils have expressed concern it 's outside policy or just like it is any other comment and while we 're on that particular base which is three bar 14 right at the bottom figures show that there 's a 3.47 under the month the month yield where last month of a 3.47 four percent decline I 'm not quite sure how that 's how that 's actually happen there 's not really understanding that your total return against budget went through all ends of the bone one first it 's a triple B plus and we have circulated to all councillors a copy of the paper that was considered by the previous council and passed resolution where they adjust adeline policy to agree to continue with the investment should drop the load will be passed thing yes definitely we would look at seriously exiting it at the moment the market is pretty flush with funds so the interest rates that we could get by cashing in that 20 million and reinvesting would be less than what we currently have if bond was with we probably would have exited some time ago but as I say that term and this this council elected to rescind the previous resolution rules and continue with the investment so you worship to do that we have to use standing orders to put their resolution on the next council 's agenda Patrick correct and just one comment and hopefully I 'm not speaking out of turn here I would have concerns of the council started going back to previous resolutions passed by previous council and rescinded them will revoke them problem i have you worship i don 't own this money the ratepayers of cap I own the money and it falls back enough suddenly things go belly up it 's different to the previous or the council 's standard resolution of aa 's at aaa+ Eleanor something like that this is below that that 's the thing that worries me well I think the counselors have all received the information must have been handed their signal here and if there is a downgrading of that investment people really advising us this you know so um have a cancels i think this man agreements with that so if you want to do here is all relative not seen done by formal motion weather on other undefeated or not we have it clearly on the books what this council has decided and they will stand by that thank you any other queries caps some of questions please say a three-bar five and i can have some clarifications as regards to assets have decreased but depreciation has increased and i have some reasons how that works chechen enomoto size on the possession is 18 3 4 comma hard 18 million and your assets have read and have reduced without having the excessive register in front of me top of my head i was he saying it 's to do with the mixture of the assets and the light of the surveyor major assets could be shorter if we look at the revaluation a lot of that could be doing a writing which has a a very low depreciation right but we look at the wastewater plant and water treatment plant they represent quite a significant part of the for example bloating and your plan will give us that bigger picture the es lebe long-term plan and for example we are not currently yet sexy message yeah but happy to show you outside the meeting wonderful day dinners the other question is 3 by 16 and we yes our interests at cost to you today we have a mat improvement it 's quite a significant improvement and you 've done well on that and score but can you tell me what the surface is going to be useful reduction well it is basically yes okay thank you that 's all just very quickly I 've had from this for the last two months and it 's very pleasing to see we have a tick three guards to 360 where we had a couple of crosses so I think staff let thanks thank you ok any other Christians ticket chief executives report not could I have a mover please answer cousins Thank You seconded by Councillor dollars all those in favor please say aye those against Gary _"

yeah I I would forward an electronic copy of the grapes that 's all a bit chicken to explain of what those actually are and I think that would be very with well particularly going into their 10-year

nothing else and the opportunity for the chair potentially in the easy chair to attend and 13 bet Nick shop that was just be jira dignity I just like to Committee is is relatively a new committee it 's really not consolidated yet as a committee I love to and i would recommend that myself is chairman and the deputy chairman councillor jolons attend this workshop in 110 purely because it is a new committee and things have changed from local government I really perceive this as being an important community of counsel and I don 't think we quite copy of what it should really be doing as of yet and with the program that set out there I think it would give both myself and councillor Galen 's the ability to probably try and get this committee really functioning as it should move that as a council committee leadership so I 'd recommend that this workshop before the cost us and sex ending 80 producing a pitcher there 's a Monday yeah 30 of G and F we attended I would make a commitment to write a report of the session because i believe i am going to cancel the heck things comments i think in terms of the regulatory environment that will be facing some new regulations important to me and i believe quite got one hundred percent right here because it 's so new I think it 's got opportunity so economically I hope the lieutenant gets a job drive report in your area yeah I guess it peso you wish my way so here you new number three I think teen revealed by that council something joel osteen when said local government watered was training be held on the thirteenth of june and be approved noting its Black Friday is there is just one other day yeah gets the heckling Matt 11 I would like to raise being chairman of threat we have got the deliberations to do so there will be a and what what we 're sorry we 've done a deliberate but it is coming back to our committee to find a document to be approved so that it can go for cancer for application leadership and we are looking at perhaps trying to do that after one of the annual plan during deliberations so that we so I just like to mention that because okay because I need to be certain as a carry on so she amazing writers are doing I 'm thanks liability yeah yeah how much noticed you everybody doesn 't have to get found this really knows us for that because it of them against the division meeting with all the council 's are we on this one two things of the public who would be interested they will advise she runs a peek over heat index in June I heats on assistance a meaningless cpio Friday to six I counted the drawer the Beast paper came out was meeting child on Friday 60 calendar he 's friday the six I think yesterday it wasn 't on a calendar in it on Monique and then we got to repeat the brutal organic composition and resolution now we 'll do is less than 1 2 3 it 's it 's the citizen to die this is a real problem that it 's councils we 've got if one minute of it was meeting me from the camerupt identified a moonbeam got one shot now it 's cancelled and we can be Peyton Place I think so on something little keep calendars correct because we moving for some of these days so some of the meeting support others clothes holders and because we don 't know what what is he really going to be happening the air NZ she was weak shops we practically first on a Tuesday so we know which shop that 's par for placeholders cancel than many weak shops for them so sometimes it does get a little bit but confusing and I don 't know why they fix formation ahead for basically you don 't have to ask for that to happen so all I bet I can find out why thank you okay alrighty thank you suggestive dumb I mean is resolution here with a new factory that 's the heckling and Dawn 's together and of course remove the police if you let me go digging through it like this does look increasingly regards to item to the stu christian specially when this came up i thought the recursive 150 and I think we 're all agreed that a staff member would come expecting us on ccos rather than the expensive I person initiate a major accounts the fact that in an RV to report on that meeting I know cancer you go on down for product but we do actually have to receive report if we if you get into but to conferences and select means reports all they 're gonna remember support since I met Nikki what was I think I 'm discussing this with you your worship in regards of some of the huge costs the local craft new zealand is making councils i counselled pay to seeing counselors to meetings it 's almost like a gravy train I believe we 've got some extremely talented and qualified staff they could probably cuter as much as if go to a conference as i would like when you go to the local government econ from Julis CEO take this up with local government easy on because some of these costs extra jobs are doing yeah he can 't play and it 's sneaky which I can 't_''_533.76 to the folio and it 's far as I 'm aware that cost that was petty very late to talk to us we we had and that the cops when we were finally told about what it actually was was 395 dollars and I approve do it was a better present excess of

Blakely previously its X consecrate agreed to that through their process that 's the body she would be when this agenda was was written for a boy coming the option to take or agreed whenever he mentally is also don 't sorry sorry I 'm what do you want agree though in the ideal scenario you know in the ideal world we would get the answers to do the bike and get the bike up as soon as we could we 're having this discussion because of money yes has anybody been to any corporate sponsor or so Santana 's Township are you willing to have a strip only inspire better so that was thrown back to miss lately yeah at the workshop and I 'm unaware of any conversation even had I personally haven 't_''_324.03 because the conversation went is two options on the table and there 's an option fire and stomach coming from and I think you right in the world I I 've not been to corporate sponsor the desire is to get this thing up as quickly as possible you could you could say from the late please point of view that I photos hours they made we should be asking the questions you know of anybody that might like to contribute yep across the board no that 's it I have heard nothing from a member of the community four thousand dollars from topix electorate Moodle thanks Taylor there 's often a drain not a bit to me which is that which was very nice them and remember there will be a cost whichever way we go of materials or or neighbor and so it 's good good that you raise the casa Dom 's because we 're not too late to do that and he did it all depends on the decision today it 's still going to be on budgeted cost sorry yeah Castle pack i justjust take it on two counts of John and I Jena Wright tie for last week 's week 4 inch at dmoz so the question about sponsorship any big thoughts I think um you know integral in the biking community and and they can hit any approaches or offers of support or anything else firm from anyone in the general public they just want the bike up as soon as possible it means what 's happening here is that people are corporate funding it of the cost so in some ways we 're not getting a corporate big corporate to gave us 24 thousand dollars but we 're getting a couple of engineers or so modules for the cops no labor included so in my mind they are sponsoring this this repair just a clarification on the health and safety aspect of it drawing once we put their cap in some thoughts often or something like that it might be because of a minor defect in the bike or something like there are we 've been liable because we 've gone or degree option how does it work is it just like piece of playground stuff is to us know this to us business first of all we 'll get a ps1 we 'll get it signed off by structural engineer to each others should you have it in terms of this is a sculpture remember and we 've been very clear from day one as this sculpture if people choose to climb on it then I do so at their own risk and that the by base of the bike mr. president this quite clear on that thank you it was just yeah it 's not a sign eyes I 'm install it 's covered so okay my my recommendation it 's worth it will be to go with Richard Devine because I think he 's set up correctly as worships workshops and experience to set up perhaps a bit more than Raul and cannot but that 's just my suggestion to you basically we should probably could do with it and what 's various written agenda Judy anything cheering so you be I 'd also like a mother I 've gotta move so you asked me for the local weekly cleaning way that will rotate this for their community that can lock my bouquet more so well I even being there then I open immediately approached area really comes notice n plus yeah I said ok any other discussion I think they knew was we just leave just the communication of this of course in like such a Georgia again to play professionally written communication rendered yeah bikini time difference and yeah it 's always a had one we go with wave innocent people yeah but I believe times I talk I know times at night I don 't believe I know that I and I think in the wider interests of the community en and we hit offers to do the store as long as it 's cheap by our engineers it 's done add a percent failsafe direct whatever you I come in supporting canceled Bonnie 's resolution so I think that 's the way where we go and the other thing is when we do get their camp if you must make sure that it 's merely fruitful you play some more sticks around that I don 't know now that can be achieved or what you can do we 've got some rocks in 50 days okay so every but anyway am so I think we 've had to make a tough decision on this in Thank You counselors for were probably talking to people something Padma captain asked after weeks of the office and I think we 've made the right decision in the interests of the problem is you need to move but kept the body say aye as against Karen Jim the property bar bring it down sure did we end exist they put their body body got the whole hog if they existed so sweet like there is some way through our load around what you mean because of a growing new magnetic but we 'll just have to repeat that the glass snake is realize how much more after we going to be liable for remaining victims tox I think the question was that can we reduce me yes sir mr. chairman we can get any more for the PFA price we have a number of outlets as you say they are currently covers and we said beyond over to against policy the exes used to music or Bobby to was quite suitable 2,000 post questions for all councils in about media we 're in a shared service oration we have our exams that week okay there 's an element of that general damages that looks in fury Odin artifacts is a maximum amount its tenants and it 's

    "text": "and just said I 've had a request to go to item number 84 which is some animal management and environmental health fees and charges record so mr. green signal thank you thank you very much so the reason for it is that this item we consulted with this please through the inner pain process of your things and but because of the timing for the registration need for the both dogs in read kalasala means we need to get them voices out and registration X outside in say an item to you today resolution on mountain in the face so walk you through the item there was no submissions make and from the public on fees for the dog the dog pleased to be weak and there 's one submissions made by the young medical officer of health for the relation to the health leaks and making sound being related to the costs of the annual registration for a food control thing so food control means are a voluntary scheme and that the proposed legislation which is more of that Lissa Council going in a checklist approach of are approach including see seems with the ways of the legislation 's going unfortunately it bit process is a lot more time council officers to do anything in speeches and so the way of funding policy sets is that we have a policy of funding these fictions directly so the registrations are covered by the owner of the business so we 're trying to match the bees as they are currently to the likely cost of of the inspection and registration process and so you 're originally nation from my sullivan 's as that they stay is proposed such as exactly the same Liza 's the parking regulations and they both balance out of the day I mean it was no no further submissions mate is a couple of cities of resolutions on page eight batter you can use a condition ticular squeeze your fish terminal screws that 's a body tells us proceed to take place you know the nose which is one submission it 's asking for some charges reduced get more people on board it 's secondly on eight bag to other options expression of the options can complete the charges it simply proceed from the uniform general charge and environmental 64 fees and charges of forty percent from the gene will rake and they are those percentages both funds from the jingle rate and if so why so is the funding policy talks that is is touristic students take the health one as at lycée element where the officers go on site innate and speak three princess and there 's also the element where we respond to complaints so food hygiene complaint complaining that their quality of buildings quality of premises and so the ratio relates to basically direct funding when it relates to our premises in solution and the rates under before that the community good element just get on moco a counselor and thats it through the log template as you can change it long-term plan so the single pane will suffer those those and there is something that you can kind of have an account for to meet you it just seems to me writing that regeneration in funding some cost of the business nikki guess I 'll Williamson my page 84 I fund shot licenses never being stroked replaced by that sixty dollar fee for the trading public place approval fifty bucks except for the year or just something else and this sort of here so these two licenses one is food inspection license to make sure the premises of section any I want us to trade another place so mix and approval under the bylaw so providing you meet a particular criteria you can trade on the side of the road okay of time can somebody what balls are a paypal cool this is very common theory gave the wrong with me is there a reason that we now have a sixty-dollar annual so we pulled inspection fee or neck has never been there and we 're part way through the first three here 's the long-term plan and why would you want to ever charge of sixty dollars annually to speak to import the reebok first discussion of is there is what we haven 't is that we haven 't been very good at undertaking some inspections in the past and so we 've initiated a program we 've gone through pulls in the district to and speaking to make sure they compile it yet which is the wording under the Coronet desert council is responsible to ensure compliance at all times that is proposed to be changed teach together in the future but it 's not currently the case so yeah plus 400 million fears that we have a compliance officer visits property in it I 'm a yearly basis to ensure that compliance are still being me Arizona photos that 's the only charge that will be here and if there 's food inspections required they may be judged without language is going to go on this inspection league is not included if you 're out for consultation and they drive vehicle clean it 's also been introduced partway through those first three years along to be if next we we can alter the way the funding rate or that you have trying to break in and so potent query why expect you to be my connection this the speed was consolidating part of their drafting you clean in saitama hasn 't been inserted it all comes to jobs accounts were here we 're in the process of a draft and your plan we 're still on the process of consultation we 've got an item in front of us that we 're supposed to be proving outside that consultation process this really the right process before I appreciate the timing thing that some of these chapters do relate to rates as well and do it submission one submission on one of the items so should we be making passing a resolution now quite crayons that one country music even the only way to avoid that essentially for the future is bringing a handful and that this these are unlike your rates builds these these creepy these fees need to be sick now to enable the bills to be set out in time for legislation that 's one of those nominees and the legislature met nine years I 'll be themes councils head through this process most councils have to do this process and recently Maria in your camp process we presume mr. green that there are some changes during their deliberations we 've been beat any movement and this resolution we 're seeing and what we finish why we didn 't really try and pull out in these submissions that have come out and hear this I to come after impressing license fee so so he changes on their own even based can meet me and be based on the submissions that you perceived and you 've only got one submission that substance which ones to grieves us the outlined as i said before you can 't change their funding smut peddler stage so what we were saying is doing important very communion event particular fee is reduced in so essentially makes a decision that you can make they do you reduce their fee if you do then balance of the cost of in raipur so going all of the way that cuts the body and talked about before and so do have you been overall grants and then that would have an egg on your evil plan deliberations later because we just hit the crease the doodle right okay what would happen in a business resolution was tabled if it was tabled we wouldn 't be able year so then you 're really figuring your own because there 's a general right now but just to clarify the council 's at rest the creature procedure no no not like there is nothing in or what about what we wrestle to do here and what we 're asking to do is to bring forward that one submission in terms of us this very simple metallicity space it makes a decision on there the same process that you 're kind of taken for at least the last two years okay that 's true can you just because hinges on it when submission can you just go through again for me please watch that submission wanted and their reasoning why so that I can look at this now in a different light so so the minister our midwife stroke health care leaders to two systems and these are food hygiene regulations which should be in since 1976 which require us to register for Emerson again do not to make sure that they can 't like and these their proposal under the under the food bill to still before Parliament we the operators and sort out how they can operate your business and we come in and we ordered pick on am on a yearly basis so very very similar system that the onus is more on the operator than it is on the counselor telling what they completed a degree in its early seems to be the weight of the legislation of teeny on state change next before Parliament and potentially to be good this year what what were suggesting is that Nick pricey so the submission requests that the fees for the audit reduced to encourage people to that new scene because and they see it as being more proactive than the the operator to be an even game oh then when he for us to tell them Heather Lexi business but from our practical perspective on the ground the distinction take some amount of time if not slightly longer doing your work so in order to make out our fees requirements and the piece of the funding policy we see there 's a st. the same charge so we like to encourage them in other ways and carries and particularly through that ministry said get on board but because it 's not me down at this one time in the costs to the organizer council as the same as the in the morn stiction process we believe in the face should see it 's the same thing thank you okay thanks ribs all right I think this sort of a mistake you can assure a statement I pro CCS in that and then move your problem so it suggested resolution here i have a mover and podcaster stewart cink is by Councillor thick when all those in favor please say aye okay those against so here 's my keys so i get the cool members miscarry _"

financial can somebody giving it easier it and i 'm not sure where we call it here on 3 33 16 United 50 yoga excuse me and what I 'm talking about here just pages when the three of the stage and then we 'll move into the financials right you 'll see that the financial update to the 35 April where council are still tracking very well compared with budget and the area forecast school shows us of being and a couple of points as we go through and then we can come back to answer any particular questions if we look at the monthly treasury management report you 'll find that most things that they drool what is of interest here is that the return on the TL plan is still greater than the average cost of borrowing for the year we 're going over to work on that we brought the management of the tea or fountain house during the 2007 2008 financial year 16 year-on-year the return on the tier your thumb has been greater than the average cost of borrowing and each year and this is right to the global financial crisis the extent of that is that in those six plus years the interest return on the TL thing has been six and a half million dollars more than the interest that we paid on our borrowing editor that during that time which subsidized rates to the extent of 27 and a half million dollars now I just dig that background to show that this information that forms a smugly treasury management report is what that we that 's just being cool so this information these financial reports and the calorie report and the treasury management reports are very important tools in your toolbox as far as government 's is concerned and it suddenly just keep in mind as you head into deliberations following after that is the project performance report and management team here I need to have your answer any questions on that and in conjunction with any questions you have on the remaining parts of the CEOs paper unless yeah I would dearly like bug information to be perfect i still be to the public for topic great production over those years I think people don 't realize is just a direct air frontier from the Jews we 've deliberately held back from sharing of information and two after that the hearings I apologize is another day of hearing to hit of us but I didn 't want get information to color any questions that were being asked of the submitters but we are going to we will give you a hard copy of that information budget first cuz that can somebody got the three barcoding turn out to be over grass we have no roads are perpetually state for pick up there for a minute mister walk with answering some of those questions were briefly back to webcast to find out what proceed and along the lines that that problem would be eliminated and thereby would not be an overdraft the game but I 've see that we are I 'm just wanted clarification of there these simple counselor the absolutely correct in the excitement and it 's a tiny thing so what I was explained that the last meeting is that we have a negotiated with the banquet is called a sweep account so that 's happens sorry that was them for me to post this incident and so from the following report has probably would have been a better statement at the last meeting that will not happen again because we have a boss caught it lightly sweep occurring with the bank just goes short looks at the balances it certainly Accountability Board or credit and it just makes a zero and transfers it to be young signals I is it was raised previously by councillor Jordans I noticed that this particular aliens investment that we have the BB being plus rating as I think now has ten million dollars not five I think we really need to find out what 's that BBB rating actually me because I 've I 've discussed in the past I get nervous with it below the policy can discount on the docket that 's what I 'm so what 's being told off the selection so right the okay so the the particular bond and question is is a safe trouble with ice road next to a decent grade the council is I think Rick previously has passed that what 's called an exception resolution for that particular bond given the underlying support if you like all the young anz bank witches of the top market i believe a- rated i think a couple there right so suited with a policy so i 'm trying to I guess understand the concerns are you what further information we can provide counsel to give you some comfort around when fundamentally it 's about returning not sure what further information we can go early atmosphere the real identity difficulty I have as a new counts are not bringing the last council when this decision is made we have a policy on real weakness of we reinvest back the raisins of those investments and this is the outside that policy to me that therefore as a breach of the policy at least we 've changed our policy to take in that lower rating it should we be doing it because if it turns tearful and I respect the comments from Council of dollars regards off some of the outlooks really dies in the firing line now I have to go back to the people of the depo thoughtful district and say well we mucked up on this one and fortune we 're liable and not liable to the degree of making a mistake therefore I need clarification we destroyed without investment you indicate the last month recent not just to stay with it all we change the policy comes Ziggler I 'll love the penis y over 2 provide for the preparation the revenue in finance set by council council has the discretion at any particular point time to step outside that policy been doing so it must be done by means of a formal resolution of council that is what council has done and respect of its own policy and this particular investment any change that nature would require a rescinding of the resolution of council and the facts would be put forward to council should that be the wish of the mere as the person who sets the agenda for the next council meeting to have a paper of that nature on that agenda being so beer that 's what staff will adhere to but point I make is that the policy is a council policy and council has the discretion to step outside its policy of Apollo 's of right formal procedure and that has occurred in more than one occasion thank you that 's electronics notify am from council body and the point that I was trying to make last last month that I wanted to see was just a review of that situation that resolution to step outside the council policy year we 're a year and a half into it I have some concerns about where financially that the global economy is healing again in the next 18 months I just want since chick and a review to make sure that that was the right place to hear it I 'm not questioning the policy or sticking outside of it I just would like a review done a year into it just to make sure that it stops as sound as it was when you make a decision in my scratch okay we are at the discretion of the team all right any other questions others at mine a complete Rotter the best attack and send a free services my life so I 3523 this is all drop it off the plane to acquire 3-time 2003 juries and other buttons responded to but I don 't know if our issue with straight alternates district missing any better so they might be responding the time but I don 't know getting the issues on trade off that 's both amazing and we slightly have anything in regards to day issues happy thank you this state like this is for generation to the first initial response but we use as a response back to a customer and but you did right and we talked about it in the past and we 've a number of initiatives that were looking at doing work a stylish and we will be continued to seduce the dollars you expect my point is that it 's great to head up their ass qualify but what 's the result from those responding we discusses I won 't break the council Internet yeah they might thank you Castle Stuart I just like to edge that the entire any we do have an issue with dogs and I know it 's how to find them but actually think that something and needs to be looked at just to do a concerted effort to sort the dog thing out every now and again because it does seem to get out of control I 'm so pack I just stand busy we just like to come in co I 'm changing the format of the recordings far easier to read and understand 2 2 they 've talked about at Costa meets survey undertaken in economic impact assessment please make major event two weeks we know anything um yes are those the beets vision i 'll use some like freaking something events rapid destroyed oh yeah so though they 'll rain from just a desktop analysis we will get a post-event report say for someone that 's how far with the make well as word of themselves or will conduct a full room so I 'll Richard to make an element see a little back must assume Joaquin and take the comments from Council park and came to the report but if there are any other comments in terms of format or in terms their friends you might see in them within receive back outside this meeting and try to make it more visual and user-friendly that these other information like Jesus video

BAE 's and from topple nice to see you guys here you been listening to the webcam could you hear us you could yeah who 's been the best performer so far I understand you know as I said the cancers earlier this is a screw all right so good on you for coming out of your school holidays and learning about le and do our job and them so hopefully this and future counselors and leaders amongst y ESO nice too heavy and just relax and listen just go to the next item yeah i so it 's really shocked murmurs anniversary behalf of night he does seem as a gorgeous but it can be at three places at once and essentially they 'd see this quite a procedure washing and what can I will be looking at undertaking a special plan for the last 12 or 18 months essentially we 're at the next stage of that so we 've been through the evidence formation stage and in reader to start on to the next stage so this item basically asks for your support and the player process in the establishment of a joint committee to be able to govern that waikato special cleaning process and does it I say does everybody and anybody will start nothung worry about what your special period answer officials writers to workshop there 's nothing it is such a lot of fun head detail and I just got a little bit of concern that we but we 're not being taken along and getting the full information so who gets to understand the whole process so I guess what 's two and done part of the reason why with the other like it our councils to get in front front of but the the other part of that is that this has only the first stage in the process as your CDL remember a joint committee and so the work of their joint committee would be reported back to Council on the regular basis and most likely you know in a workshop situation as we go forward so this isn 't about any outcomes just about starting their process off which you 've really identified in your long-term plan in your annual plane to assess their yes were at that stage this is a heads up and can we join them can we form this committee so that you can heal those briefings on a regular basis still just a little bit uncomfortable because unless you get you your foot on the first pedal should we say in and you 're taken along sometimes difficult to catch up I have because I tend their real over yeah I thing else thud alarm overly real forum and they 're more than happy to come and report back to you really we 're all the way Kalin we 'll build a bad plate million so I 've got a both games but we need to be part of this to be yeah I know Hamilton 's getting quite a pair house and as you are consuming yet and that we need to be part of the discussion sorry so this is the initial stage that the spatial clean and the soon forget our involvement going forward but they I think there would be a good request of you Austin for them to come and yeah I 'm the details of an echo possessed and then the three us to leave a 21 it 's going to be next month very similar no mistake I guess I 've just dumped into a grave of councillor heckling and the key finding on stage one above the nine tasks and both add the old sort of pillars of what the local government we 're about of cultural social economic and environmental well-being and they have been changed and and there are going to be more informed sir just I love with councillor helping sort of the same thing when I went the little sentence that says smaller seemed just like taupo my phone get a special plan his little do it riverland riverland so I 'd like to know we were sitting there it 'll really worship and maybe mr. green could clarify though all they 're asking for us here is to be part of the processes that move forward the next crucial step for us is when they set up the joint committee that we have representation on that committee that will represent our interests and represents the direction of this councils that would be the time to workshop sustained accrued like the body which I just like to acknowledge the challenges that have been defined in this document for the tiny rural populations and associated deployment services and the aging population and the shrinky school base and also just Christian the words they use the word cohort I 'm get up to a dilemma when they use words that 's the tenth of a Roman legion recipients this may be the younger people to make in the room can assist they just say what they mean but if I do accept that outline two of the important areas to kind in populations and aging right so distant there 's loosen their move but homely veterans d goodbye Kevin 2008 Utley so I high a 's against Mary can we just make a just a comment on 727 21 because like automatically our look at the air strips we 've got one or there 's one in Hamilton has got one interpret so you know weird where is all this information how 's it been generated because I 'm i just picked that one up as other as a point of interest so is some of the other information correct I don 't know I mean we 've got an important helper websites of it for you I 'm often involved in this regional sports facility review and have provided information about the typo district sports facilities for the like an original review a lot of the facilities that they 've got listed on the other facilities wart ones that they were actually interested in so very information that 's been things that people feel home at the time and just throw into the mix but they weren 't actually asking us about new strips so it 's not a complete picture of the Waikato region resistance that 's my concern realistically they 're not actually interested in rear strips for the purpose of the stem so the thing is are we really interested in the facility types on 720p as we go through sure item number right okay okay see you back then join us you very much what so this item is to provide feedback on me 1415 statement of antiques for our 45 of our sex CCOs as you would have noted and the March agenda and the sexy co which is the lake toba prediction trust has reviewed by the Joint Committee so what this item is designed to do is provide feedback and we have lobsters have reviewed the five yessir wise I mean an addition we had on the 18th the DG LT workshop to discuss these arise so we 've also summarized the points that were made by councillors eminent meter and so I are around sifting as they the resolutions are there and adopting the comments there can be a window to discuss in this meeting or we can actually choose not to comment on the statements magnitude so we need to provide this feedback by the first of May cream serum I 've just my little pit I 'm wanted clarification around the woods minor used under the DDOT comments are made by counsel this is minor minor minor minor minor and white on the front is Robert a lot of that stuff to me I don 't consider the minor because it 's about accountability so when we talk about accountability soul consider that to be important I just Percy think that those ways minor should be removed thanks mighty versus what council was trying to say it 's just my opinion well obviously removing a movement to that effect we have to have the motion foot first which minor remove yeah because it 's the site undervaluing what we were saying yep that 's it so it from their commitment yep there imagine just need resolution run yep you 're cancer cousins I baby it should be on the lot that 's where they re litigating the statements of intense of those groups so then we 've got no just it 's clear it 's not gray all smoky it 's clear the word mine has been removed from the lot ok any other I 'm through worship just on the topo airport authority when we meet as a committee we on the statement of intent we asked that it was noted that there was going sickening some capital expenditure and I just want to confirm that that will have occurred on the estate meant of intent I was to do with some roading extensions and eagles of a vehicle and they must have been here at noted at the time it would be included but I didn 't see it in the draft I 'm just looking to my colleagues Neil and we can we can I will update the review and yeah we can control exactly if you could that would be good thinking of sorts of just a resolution Aaliyah with the added weight amended on it Casper heckling second look like after that okay move caster heckling second advocate sorry just gonna raise the question on Nate bar nine and then the primary because that states imagine a certainty you have access to debt markets participating local authorities subject always to operate in accordance with sound business practice else 's police 's should the audit risk committee please set the only effort although mass but if you like okay so the local government agency has a separate board which is some in a appointed Craig stove overs a cheer and I can 't talk my head remember the other parties but they 're all very experienced done corporate directors well known in New Zealand I can get you those names so the August e that is governed by the board and the the representations that the LG FA has to make to the to the board of directors so we rely on the expertise GUI yes yes you do and your comments via the SOI whether it comes in from a typo district shareholder we are one of I can 't remember exactly how many but the the other party 's been other councils throughout New Zealand he was would ok this resolution has been moved by Councillor hickling and seconded by Councillor pack all those in favor please say aye ok against carried item number 9 thanks Chloe he 's doing this one submission on health and safety reform dogs box likely go down I think you wish I don 't quite every here think thank you worship you 've seen the submission before this is real it 's a mechanical item we had a deadline to get in terms of getting something to the Select Committee happy to answer any questions any questions and queries mr. you worship my one 's not a question in my ones to do with the resolution the words compare that reserves the right right through the comment in the future very saying that we endorse the draft submission but we 're not does that God enables not to make any fear the submission with the drive to appreciate it it 's still clear on my understanding is that the submission date may be extended as well so if is the opportunity to do son so at the time we put that submission together based on I think it was for popular colleagues that attended an EMA seminar on the lower phone booth some help and it reflected those thoughts at the time but if there 's anything else subsequent a bit before we can get Jessica worship that on nine bar for in relationship to the letter signed by LC people 's existence Williams it states that council is concerned that the bull refers to regulations had not come into force and that submission has been made without detailed knowledge of such regulations into the reason for my words being added to their original resolution you 're quite right there are regulations have not yet been formed it support hold the bill so we are making a solution and erect on the nipple go and decide and knowledge so through the chair just the regulations actually have been written so it has um to know where that 's going to lead so I just I 'm not sure FFX said with this draft submission you probably another opportunity on the regulation I 'm not certain about them but we haven 't seen any detail around loans X for Jim the reason I needed the weeds but reduce the right c c11 you know in his problems they have da believe that I 've made their way careful buddy seeking about counselor cousins always in favor please say aye I think it scary item number team this is I originally mental draft in your pain so this is very game your shop in a game like the last items you have already seen the submission and

fishes appears on the screen or never right moved by Councillor John ones seeking the four counts the cousins all those in favor please say aye I scary _"

always been seen as a as a respect thing and so I guess the question is do you want anyone to do that this year as keen so John stayed here and we could they be a window of day so we breathe air through with some River was brilliant I 'm more than happy and you wish I I 'm happy to be a backup in case of datas Whitford ons that 's good idea thank you very much item number living my true our punch water supply extinction Manish afternoonish Sherman nice to see you just briefly i 'll tell you submission was received in the last annual plan or connecting to old more to our village they are on private supply in district health board has also requested counsel to consult with the community who are on the private supply as a part of resource consent renewal process for our wastewater discharges giving sufficient time the feedback feedback was not very favorable as you can see you on the document it 's almost twelve percent of supporting sorry 12 people are supporting and 44 are not supporting which comes to majority not supporting it so my recommendation to the council is water supply should not be extended because majority rules i 'm open to discussion if you have any questions or and concerns related issues yeah I you to be disappointed what cancer cousins artist for the business just for the council I think the of those they really wanted a very vocal and I understand a need for it but was he didn 't gain any weight especially with most have been holiday homes down there and i think it was they were saying it 's an expensive didn 't really want times of the year that they 're there the ball water is adequate they 're still quite people 's down there with a high manganese content so all the porcelain and houses a stained yellow and the water can be off times but i think they will make do they will go home early but they 've all decided a gun and beer at commercial operators daily which of these two maybe three we 're keen to have it unfortunate which were curious timely actually see one of the coffee shop or the one of this commercial operator which is a coffee shop there is members and they were very key that we are really supporting on behalf of contractors but they are so far away at the cost of connector will be cost-prohibitive to them and majority those volley there when people have already spent three four thousand dollar but they don 't see the longer picture consistency at the safety so this is how we got the feedback so I 'm open so the house and it 's all for the coffee shop of the candy the commercial operators is nothing you can do it really that like there 's nothing yeah however ID is you know because the coffee guy is really stress to you enough water yeah I think it 's one of those situations where we will continue to examine different options because we licorice them they 're very sort of motivated in terms of changing their situation so it 's not closing the door it 's just providing this community foods that and then working with those commercial pliers to see if there is something we can stack up for them you should have discussions change in the future you can then look at again you know mr. space yeah yeah yep thank you yeah right councillor hoechlin yeah I knew that we from the annual plan and long-term plan but how does that leave us in terms of health and safety the new water drinking standards and suchlike sorry I didn 't hear a question yes am I was actually hot what position does he put Counsell in in terms of the new water standards and yeah currently what a lot of treatment scheme is basic chlorination just taking care of is a bacteriological compliance is not a full compliance because the water is sourced from the like which is unprotected catchment it requires a little higher level of treatment and because compliance requirement due date is year 1516 according to the certain minimum and at with consultation and affordability of the community so all that basis you know we will work out and go to the community saying as a part of a node plan or a long-term plan so what is required in on that basis we can do is that but minimum requirement is making a public health risk management plan getting a sign up from a director thank you or Assessor which we have done already you can already okay then terms of the community drinking water standards is where we provide a community supply if there is no supply then you 're not bound by those standards either it 's at Raymond so I was just want to end that event of a fire is the a fire hydrant there I 'm just thinking it like say in the case of a committee we didn 't have a water supply as such but we had a fire hydrant pipe wouldn 't so I 'm just wondering what we have been dear if Lisa Empire the approximate is to like run the lake there I would think that no no because there is not a definitive supply there will be no I don 't like I know the new mood wapa village which is developed as a proper hydrants that everything but somebody is on a private supply they are supposed to make their own standard and the fat we can take consideration of that I 'm just wondering if was the apristas at sea back then I don 't know what how that came about but this fire hydrant network comes around in the water there and some people have been able to access what in that way yeah it was a special levy pay but but again the firefight and regulations they apply to where we have a reticulated supply and if we don 't have a reticulated supply them there 's no obligation on council to provide a fire hydrant and again it 's a bit one of those community issues that the community needs to decide because obviously it comes at a cost to people and feedbacks within the paper why they instant what do they have to pay for any of that youngin 10 year planning cycle it might be that you we could run some further consultation with the people in that facility and you may decide to offer I 'm not saying to waive costs but to offer assistance with the way it 's paid for that may be an opportunity to to discuss moving forward and just trying to provide options and safe as it stands at the moment it 's it 's not accepted by thought is if it if you leave onshore bagging ago okay it 's right as its sweetness to the reserve of prison and presence in the area where there 's been a matriculated water put on but they 're not be reticulatus a sewage system does it because it would have an impact but not having town supply water and no town no main surge there any place in the ship with it does occur yes you do have had the IDP is a classic dumb activity if we were like it activity has reticulated water-related water but all on septic tanks yeah I think you 've tried the same up through kosher by you 'd be a person or a legal issue or just need clarification as how this has come about I notice there in the document you mention a submission was one submission or was it a joint solution of sight row of people last annual plan we got only one submission and then a part of the second submission was our wastewater discharge consent required as as a part of condition to consult with the community gain asking them to connect it and advising them about the risk of using their unprotected bore water in that 's why the concentration occur that was a part of our consulting way so to consider as well so they asked who paid for the the costumes in the report in the work that was done report for was at the motor I resonance vara levy height work how was it funded in a row so effectively we 've had capsule expenses spent on one submission asking for something yeah they so next time with one submission on an issue we 're going to go to road travel to know is this more than a major requirement was the wastewater discharge consent I issued by regional council as a district health board was a submitter asking the council 's the condition should be the proper district council should be consulting to the old one-two up a village resident those who are on private supply so that has also triggered to go as full consultation with the community so why then did I not Pfeiffer why was it the right path of my district this is part of this water discharge consent so that 's part of obligation one council to allow them to because we are discharging on the land and which can go to the lake and hence it can affect their water source as well we 're very poor masuoka anything I always thinks it 's a guest agreeable we did have money for their communications to comment anyway did we or no no we just didn 't house Mike prepared a consultation evolution in the estate Oh consultants tree to go out to get us man no no it was done Colleen house and gas resources yeah because what we printed live near most customers yet meaning that we possibly could the point is slowly made that the cost of compliance in New Zealand can be honest and we always need to keep an eye on that from a council perspective he okay suggested resolution the year the stage that to not extend me lower my driver residents at this time I have a mover for the group accounts the cousin

of food and between the existing the Holy strip theme of FedEx drive here is part of that development was putting in an extension to the sting road network and building new roads I obviously a part of prices would go through the road naming we 've gone through what are some options talk to the emergency services were key to it and and through that naming conventions the likes in have proposed a

there 's no existing properties within their proposed new strip there are some of the existing the high street so this proposal you want I propose okay thanks move cancer jolons 15 counselor fact and you know if they say I time against Kerry thanks Devon with Ivan number 14 out of summation that 's the body is given notice here cease supplying lunches for counselors I would move the motion read over the yes the cousins okay would you like speak to it the reason I brought this forward is that if we go back to prior to the election we all stood on a platform of reducing costs and transparency eccentric cetera I feel that the provision of lunches to councillors is an imposed on the right players in the 12 months to jun 13 it was 6456 dollars now might not seem a lot we actually break it down mean to fictive minute in the year I lived three houses in my area of pain for council lunches and if you really want to see how at a time if you can 't have a look at the rates for next year for some John 's woods retirement village there are 80,000 last year 85,000 this year 89,000 next year which effectively means up there there are 11 persons pain 581 dollars each to provide us with lunch now brought along with me an example of what I believe that we can do here is my lunch 90 seats provided by myself no and post to the ratepayer now I 'm too so that we came in we did not give increases to chairman of committees your other areas that we will be cutting costs down as we get further into the annual plan and I believe this is just the start to show likewise cute asian Wellington that we mean what we say so I firmly move it you have a discussion it 's been moved and seconded councillor Harvey I just like to know what the of the 53,000 blah blah blah what 's the rest of it made up does anyone know what the rest of it 's made up of anyone tell us there yes so they estimate as players like the citizens citizenship ceremonies it 'll be brief host hood and other organizations and there 's also i thinkin that one training with this been training opportunities and there 's a few others which I can 't quite record but I can certainly and provide a breakdown for you it seems quite a lot as well I quite like to know the whole breakdown really if decided one else but nakum you wish that please just unique ounce means workshops etc you mean leaving boys cetera every other function we go to the counselors go to in my reply or work because my dad the questions are reply today Jim Anderson response to counselor Harvey 's she responds about them just to me to the mood of the skate park opening and too long if a few months ago it was a they held a function while let all the celebrations were going on and the community and the scene citizens hall so we lift the community and we had our private function with these people with a Martin and I felt very displaced so I went in at introducing our left because it took us away from what I thought were me to be doing which was me to be with our people and we 'll very nice tune all those handshaking and stuff but I don 't know if that all necessary all these these foodie types of things at all necessary there is a place for him definitely but I think this is as council Johnson I discussed last night this is more save the earth but definitely a step in the right direction shown that we mean business as a council it 's just my opinion sorry did year I would agree with them councillor cousins I think it 's more symbolic than anything else and um I signal that other councils are doing around the country as well and I think it 's time we walked a bit of the talk as well and what our lunches the other thing I would also query as women would do we need car you know do we need supply of vehicles that sort of thing I mean I you know where do we start and we do we stop that 's the thing like I 'm happy to take well I 'm you know we either go the whole hog or we don 't like we could go on and on why don 't um through to cheer and responses a counselor hobby I don 't think we necessarily need to go the whole hog this is just sad to show some week and production our own spending as well really I think support council bodies motion because there are yeah i mean i don 't disagree but there are times when we 're rushing for month into another and we may not have time to zip off and get something or whatever okay thanks other busy person i don 't have time to make it simple as that okay um cancel button when it really ought it is very good very quickly to serve a guy who ate symbolic i have no difficulty at the moment because when i went to mrs. Jackson 's information i see it just gives what the costs are to us as counselors and with you etc it means workshops council meetings etc the other spending for instance the civil servants thing we had mr. crates they won 't expose today your things that are council has to do in those regards maybe we can look at that but we 're looking just that one thing and the 6456 dollar relates to lunches nothing else that will come there 's a further get into a debating on air forward expenditure okay thanks again sweetie I cold a have to make me mad or remove the one cetera because the other was we do we stand in the herbal picture with providing lunches all I 'll move it I 'll move am and itís at her or I 'll have such a move of leaks Cassie bodies moved it sick of it I asked for all those in favor say aye aye aye those against no I 'm going to have a show of hands for those four for the resolution goes against motion is lost item number 15 you worship and could f could you just in the courts net maybe those who disagree with it you just reduce lunch know if there is symbolic then just just as a history i don 't know i think it 's been a good idea raise imiss and and I think you know and i think possibly we could have a locket look at the enemy of people going to require lunch will disorder less yeah we don 't need a whole lot just and i 'll get corn to coordinate their and so when we know we 're lunch will not probably probably the best way I 've gotta say in your title own opinion but what other job pays us pays you to have a lunch what other job other jobs issue see for my smart if I 've got if I expect them to be BF who lunched have a working lunch i supply so this is we 're all discussing meetings with yes cussing also don 't leave when it 's much time we staying I 'm a courtesy but me you don 't need a latch we don 't order or do we just lift it lookin to turn it on let 's just we could just make it for the meeting day once the mother doesn 't it do just need to be very out I 'm it could be just the once the market there 's only for four days and everything as is the chair of the immunity management committee we have the group controller etc traveled down from him Jim so it 's been two hours on the road they get here there 's been an hour to two hours opportunity with people from the Civil Defence Emergency Management region that were in we just said okay thanks I come and see you later I think it 's really nice that we get to have seen with Jenna in some superb coffee and sausage roll over just just to show some respect and give them some refreshment to pick on the road and I really value those and networking opportunities and it is only once every three months so I 'd be really disappointed to have to seen them on your way with just a don 't let the door hit you on the way out yeah item is actually finished but yeah I husband is here obviously it was still a bit of a discussion and we don 't want anyone to go out of here discussing it more you guys only want it on me you know its budget I just wish if i just look at today we started at nine o 'clock we had exactly 30 minutes break three of us we back anyway we planed it come in for half days all the time you at least look at the cost of supplying the launcher it could be some savings just by okay I a little bit of prudence upon on the food that 's supplies you worship survivors hey we give you a right maybe we should okay item number thing I 'm sorry Megan deliver you I just had to say I don 't only not living in Talpiot I don 't get in touch with my other district councillors on a regular basis at all that I 've run into in anywhere and yes it 's a council thing and so when I come up um if it 's a full day and we have that lunch in it gives me time to actually talk with my fellow colleagues and and form a relationship which I won 't have it won 't happen screaming up I 'm ready to rush off and go and get something to eat or really something rushing off to get something to eat it just breaks that continuity of the day and when you 're here all day I think it 's really good for that team yes really I 'm number _"

    "text": "times have changed in a matter better reflects what we do today it 's a little just a few words of what we do and what our philosophy and vision is we haven 't see people of all ages to end we also offer maternity services and various different services most mostly for our target groupers under 25s we 're really excited to see synthetic can 't avoid being taken off the market it 's been a big mission for us so we started off this will original branding and we 've been going over 20 years so in a matter means looking to the future or holistic approach this is our our new branding and this is the difference that we making to the under-20 booth right over under 20 year olds the statistics over the years I know you guys like statistics so it 's as incomplete and comparison to the national average you 'll see the decline there which I 'm sure has been a small community like this doesn 't always get to hear a secret family planning service delivered this is our annual visits we quite a climb and the number of visits per year we had some funding to open a school clinic for a while II which is why you see the little little climb and then we lost the fundings though this why the decline and visit it 's their ethnic group breakdown yeah half our clients I 'm Mari I think we 're really exiting the people well they shine and return visits to us these are the different services we offer so youth health clinics primary mental health is now coming two days a week as we see an increase in mental health and young people contraception and family planning support sexual health survivor screening and pregnant team support which we funded by the Ministry of Health in the district health boards and we seek run off funding to cover key roles like we have a fan our support person that we seek funding for okay shoes we 've got one of the worst oral health stats and the whole country lakes district health board we 're really pushing the under 18 year olds to get registered whether dentist to 18 and then they 've got to pay for it after their and also mums you know simple things like what they feed their babies and what they give Lee babe is just to improve overall health so we really have a holistic approach we 're promoting positive mental health for our young people synthetic cannabis has really sort of caused a lot of problems with mental health so we have now got a clinician two days a week that works with us so ongoing issues are just our sustainability big things to the trp district council who phones for a house or gives us some you know quite reduced rent we 've thought about going into other premises but we just can 't afford the rent so it 's great having a lease lease rent to pay and it 's pretty much it just making you aware of what we do and we we are thanks for listening right thanks yes and yeah there was absolute honor to be at your i believe the rebranding the other night and thank you for the invite for that and yeah it and obviously you know the numbers are still very high that you see any questions from the counselors any questions or queries maybe that 's the strip mr. holder some external to know me yes we do yep we have a community clinic at prehung a health once a week and we go down to the school 's go to tongariro in the Kura thank you okay so contrition to come to my neck in oh no we don 't the ph oh here 's a nice that goes to mink aquino yeah gasoline so you worship and what what type of effects are you seeing through these illegal drugs and what you know there 's been quite a bit there was a there was a really good speaker on the radio the other morning that i was listening to and some of his thinking 's where was going to be a huge zit lyosha paddle yes yes really he came up week sponsored him to come up how the years ago and he taught in schools and it we 're just seeing a lot of aggression anger and you day with synthetics and just an increase in mental health presentations withdrawals yeah it 's just follow our own counsel heckling the other you know there 's obviously a process there they are there 's going to be banned oh not available you can you see a bit of a downside there as far as your ongoing activity yeah you don 't want probably increase energy the effects I think initially it will you 're gonna get people from going up buying up large it may be on selling yeah but at least it 's off the streets in school cuz can 't go and get it I mean I guess you can always buy things illegally yeah you know but make it a lot harder future sure we really pleased yeah just just another comment actually we 've just said these leaders student leaders on the earlier and the particular ones from type or new II just got concerns about the front or the straight ups at the college say you know as far as privacy in that so things can see in these people a little bit embarrassed know whether that was an issue so okay there was just a comment they came out whether i said IDK across town at cafe you know do the essential I students we 're very much six clinic yeah not now it 's a lot more holistic right you know it 's getting there image that says the rebranding is hopefully helping it hey we do to our staff you know it 's not all the fancy yeah I just want to live with it was back door or not Horrocks I 'm opening to leaving people and they 're obsessed to AC I 'll be we 're talking to the hit boy and he killed because that 's what something they should buy three yep cool okay or think she said sorry and really appreciate on behalf of the community that work and all your fellow workers throughout their it 's fantastic and that 's not an easy job that we really appreciate it thank you okay there 's a suggested resolution there your body thank you and seconded by Councillor Stewart thank you very much all those in favor to this one moment I 've had a couple of complaints about people not been out of here us on web team so just reinforce it will speak into a microphone yet we just see rounds got there testing testing okay how are we looking down there ID you guys all right good I don 't Matt Olien okay Paul and jane from like some waterways action group nice to see you here Paul nice to have you back in the chamber again take in Jane okay floor joists thank you very much of invitation I lakes and waterways has been in the habit of reporting annually to tap I district council the counselors Zelda just pull up against his own yet that 's it and so this is this is our annual report for the what does our previous financial year evening match 2014 and I 'd be happy to go through that if you wish happy to take questions and discussion if you wish as well which your way prefer to do it council has got the report here um what is everyone comfortable around probably happy to or queries of the pull the gym and while he 's here or do you want to highlight anything in here Paul that 's of particular interest a couple of things if I may yes and I may will just flick through this quickly but won 't go into the you know the particular detail and just as a bit of a background of a temper District Council has some wreak only and given us a ground of five thousand dollars a year and that goes to administration services so this reporters but as you know apropos of net of that grant end cool some my messages thank you very much we 're doing some pretty useful stuff I think so Lake Taupo that 's what it 's about likes and otherwise itself has got them through nine goals that 's to seek enhancement of water quality with a lake to upper catchment unites people for the benefit of protecting turbos neutral environment in advocate for sustainable development thinking with respect to any development with the lake type of catchment so the the reporters kind of structured along these lines we 're course largely a voluntary group and we do meet once a month pretty much feeling within the earth except maybe december and those meetings are advertised and the typo times and thank you very much the counselors and john and others who come along its most appreciated we try to write we try to run a you know interesting and very program around the general theme of water quality and the local environment and um so you see the a list here of the talks that that term Jamie organized um from many and varied organizations locally regionally in occasional initially and those are always pretty interesting meetings so that 's 4 2013 those ones in 2014 keeper in March um so we 're also involved in making submissions so this is advocacy in relation to water quality this year we 've had a couple of cut a couple of government discussion documents comoros that 's to do with results measure molecular forms and more specifically a freshwater reforms those are still as I understand it in the political sort of melting pot submissions have been provided by I guess waiting to hear back vishwas always a difficult business at the national level because it 's just so many issues and so much so much pressure and so many different directions and ministry for the environment has the unenviable task of trying to collate all the submissions and reach some sort of consensus for what people think and come up with a piece of legislation we also submitted to the regular regional council annual plane in the TEC annual plane so we look forward to seeing you again in this room in a few months maybe to do with our submission on the annual plane we 've also provided copies to TDC in relation to the r train vegetation policy efficacy reallys notified developments we 're a bit of a flea in the developers developers and what that 's about is making sure that developments are consistent with a smoky eye protection project so late type of conversion is in the water census about 120 million dollars that aims to protect the lake TDC contributes part of it to do with its wastewater treatment and there 's been years leading up to that in relation to controlling production of nitrogen discharge from wastewater treatment plants that cost money that 's really worthwhile a place to see in the annual plain proposed itinerary treatment coming coming back to top oh and um just a reader those two sexual in there sooner maybe a ton of year maybe more of nitrogen that 's not going into the lake environment and um that some excellent for the council win for the community so we talk to developers also about the lake taylor petition project in very keen that the developments are consistent with that so some developments result in an increase of nitrogen coming into the catchment some developers resulted in the decrease in already came with just the developers consider the nitrogen budget and exercises that can be done and quite cheaply in relation to this like total production project tap environment highlight environment highlights for the year so the linked a prepetition project received extra funding last year from the government and that was just excellent in the lake taupo protection trust has been using their money to doing discharge coming out of phony end and as i understand it they 're quite close to achieving the italian switch is an amazing an amazing children truly i 've been involved in the lake type of perdition project is kind of like side to it for a decade plus and one thing people say that the start would be it would be impossible to achieve their target well not necessarily so and it 's it 's really good TDC itself of course is contributed as I so with wastewater X and waterways has also been a bit of a flowing TD sincere about the water supply particularly for taupo the main water supply is just the railroad crossing so much just now we 're crossing so now you 've got me just off just off there just off the officers here and it 's always been considered as the risks that that their drinking water supply system is head for stormwater so at the end of summer nigut and the season we are now you get flushes of storm water coming through the system in it and sweeps around all the storm water system and done that 's pretty foul when you saw it coming into the lake of the first time and so having a really good drinking water treatment system should protect the gates problems associated with anything and the lake that gets into a water supply um you know has been big problems with I think a few summers maybe 10 maybe more years ago we had done LG actually in the lake and getting to the drinkable to surprise so that that scheme is something we 're very very pleased with the TDC here 's and funded like some one of those issues going forward I like there 's the lake taupo protection project and so we 've got this amazing project really in terms of volatile management resource management to New Zealand its historic I think and you know right we can we can do it and that should be an economic opportunity for taupo in the type like type of communities so we 've been involved in trying to look at beyond the completion of their projects are well they kind of work opportunities the things some of the things the one things when we 're very keen is supporting the buttons I don 't know if you 've heard about the tap o beef initiative and so that looks pretty good at the stage in terms of people what what looks good as people responding to the idea that yes we can protect an environment and here economic activity at the same time and that 's just great and so the balance have been regular procedures their group in a group it 's been quite strong supporters of them from the sidelines of course marketing web type of protection projects so a bit of a theme of the presentation that we 'd last year and some of the sessions that we 've headers so how can we market this end what I would love to see would be the sort of marketing organizations kind of having strong consciousness of this lake taupo protection project and actually using it Israel as a lever to check people to the catchment we 're all aware that new zealand does one hundred percent pure according to the say well actually maybe we 're not and so there 's a case where we 've got really good petition for for a significant national resource and there 's a significant opportunity that 's an awaiting me i think for us to take advantage of x1 was until you say I would like to think you were actually support for the year we mean we aim to maintain a positive presence in the type of area for environmental values in make type of protection and represent to have our community considers on water issues we 're going to continue in 2014-15 in beyond and thank you very much for the opportunity to provide air a new report to the council 's thank you thank you for thank you Thank You Jane any questions or queries oh my god you say is the mirror you know and thank you for the work that you do think we have here it is it pleasure pretty good rate of five grand were you know it 's obviously a voluntary and members of your committee and and their poor can you come heah sincere right the lake taupo protection trusters worked exceedingly well when there were pioneers in this country and then leave Liam well so we are getting international inquiries about groups wanting to come through and see how it works and see how it 's done and all let 's will think so it 's greater than Economic Opportunity and also the Talpiot beef on MasterChef last night and that 's a much better than neck in you not that I was a broken but my wife called you out and said look let 's def o beef I guess I buddy I 'm just going to make that comment at Tampa beef on the MasterChef last night was good Valley in quick question summary now agendas is a discussion to do with replanting Lucien thing is at the airport I just can 't remember the meeting I attended with your group in regards of Lucien and nitrogen we would become to you as a council if we 're going to do that to get some information may be from Mike as to what the outcome to it if so I 'm use his land to assist differently in juices at the kind of paddock scale in one of them was a neutral I saw a loose soon trial run by a grocer CH based on some of my senators put on by a lanky switch I think and that looks quite good in terms of what people thought Lucy would do would be to add low nitrogen to the system and it looks like maybe that 's not happening but he has a presentation that he that he presented on behalf of some of us egg research scientists and I 'm happy recommend that you talk to him about that individually scientist is in the catchment area hints my reason for the question that 's right so the consumer was that um Lou soon might leach relatively large nitrogen fixation like this flavor it 's right in the consumers that that might leash after after being fixed and um researchers slightly early days but it does look as though maybe there 's no cash thank you yes I Castle Davison your sex porn giant being charming of you cannot know you or community on the quality of the of the meetings and the topics you cover and your commitment to the environment they can 't arrest i 'll continue to latina you 've spoken yes thank you right right and make the suggested resolution if you counselor packs are just resolution there if they moved by Councillor packs say goodbye to the cousins all those in favor please say aye aye the game is carried thanks enjoy and appreciate item number three minutes of the district council meeting on the twenty-fifth of match we have any clarification type those already interest _"

    "text": "hmm yeah gasps cycling you hit monday then here to g was from some sorry shop yeah just perhaps brian might go to hell for brian with that governments is so the earth you worship you previously discussed the risk register and having a workshop for governance risks you may recall we haven 't set a date for that workshop yet and the interim we 've had the health and safety reform bill come out and it 's been circulated from a submissive code you 've got that and I think council apart raised the matter of have some discussion around that teachers make a submission so what we are trying to do is we over get a time frame X he gets both of those dealt with it the same time so which I just finalized a time with the EMA Health and Safety Specialist Terran talk probably preceding the governance risk which all the time and date still to be finalized a week like them in those states and happy of the times and what happened just feeling about the return with the day to the means for had mine sorry for the fifteenth of April regard to think as you do particularly means has been in our calendar for some time to be honest agenda in yesterday I get are we able to attend followed amelie like that by its cancelled immediately after that followed the meetings now the 15 take the check the times in case it was a change this happens quite a bit and I remember some time ago talking to the CEO the spec team made the commentary that may be on a monday you 've seen the other share doors of meetings that were on for that week but are not automatic through that through our system and i can 't change the physical and tetanus tubes haven 't quite a bit I 'm not realizing that on Monday that you receive no no no even I don 't think that 's an issue but the fact is that we can you get these changes can you attend maybes and quite a bit thank you any other right and also we need some appointments here correct just going to be late engagement see I think what will we be seeing appointments for those as well as in the lowes um yeah so okay so you 've got some replacements here now just thinking about this service that we have a by-election we have a new member coming on board do we save some portfolios for them or what happens the attina do we just wait do we call these now and then I mean them can we mean them at any time I mean you can there 's probably some there but might not meet for the next three months so for example who are all travel fund just knit recently so they won 't be meeting again so that one you could leave vacant and they come back once you 've got your new member why can 't original land transport committee I think is probably out of three main play early May okay so there might not be that isn 't a temporary person on the errand and review that the print of group and they would be meeting men may as well so just one person if you wanted function okay whatever mean this feel you worship I was thinking about this one over the weekend and I and I think if there aren 't any burning issues we should wait until we 've got a new electric elected representative and then have a look at the balance of the work amongst all of us potentially and particularly these but I don 't think we should rush to a point people if we don 't need to you worship can I then move that the resolutions be tabled let 's it searched I move in that those resolutions be tabled concern is the number to the family camp McCann lives in the group you might have a trouble liqueur one-ounce gin that one and I suggest number five because counsel Parker 's is offered here soon the other wonderful dear assistance in that area there and she 's got particular interest in the bike in fraternity and I 'd like to so many access group presentation last one they did make comments about not giving up daddy when you might wish to leave or nearly as soon as in signet nice job here is to the item to worship and you 're not working out I really need to talk about Regional Transport Committee I don 't_''_341.33 I don 't know whether you realize how important this transport committee is in terms of its hierarchy and out of I think there 's probably ten authorities is the seven of them that the mere attends it 's the representative of the name all of them apart from tapo and why power of a what we call they found an alternative so if the mayor can 't get or the appointee can 't get the alternative one always turns up it is a really important committee for this council to be important but I know that David 's got a lot of commitments but I do look at this list and receive that all the mirrors and they all attend it 's not very often that they up there alternative but what I could suggest is that perhaps we do I know the next meeting is quite an important one because we do they 're dealing with the transport management plan meeting in and I think it 's the first week in May what we could do is make an appointment and then make an alternative when we 've got the new year but I don 't know quite how David feels about him representing the council on this committee I know he 's pretty busy purpose to say or the other mirrors are pretty busy too I mean I 've served on there for three years and it 's it 's not an easy committee to sit on because you 're dealing with you know all the central Waikato area coromandel all the road in systems it it it 's it 's an interesting committee but it takes a while to get your head around what you do will help when I first arrived to Clayton is a representative area and it 's the fact that Clayton 's are representative of the regatta most committee that we 've got the ETA sir elevating things to that level is of serious importance if you 've got some key transport issues to do with what i would also say is that we development of the regional spatial plan and so again I would say to to elevate the representation at the regional and transport committee at this particular time would be probably advantageous I think the morning whatever lunch is like and the beauty is we don 't have to play classroom fat is dis remember either ok so that it is whatever I would need a substitute just in case a man loves this new person whoever is could be the real shame to Russia sorry forgive watch that just an observation through the cheer though if it 's that important to a committee because it wise looking at the new counselor well good point I think probably for continuity probably yourself if you don 't mind to be the substitute because you 'll be near three years or if if I accept that they I would want to come up to the meetings with you as well and just sit in the back because it 's one of those sort of things that if you 're going to be in the council no he 's just going once a year you 're out of all the information yeah I 'll just conscious of the fact I do spending quite a bit of time in the waikato with the what the eff up with the regional games and that sort of thing to say but that 's fine ok happy to do then and there what about me mango nations and second us for those i do that one then we wanted to you wish you number three there is number three we do anything yeah in myself please enjoy the tub move on the second thought I 'll move all those in favor tonight and so we go what about number two thank you know Connie there 's keen on it oh yeah who 's on me no one but you have a save that one yeah we 're going to say sorry okay to be moving to compare one yep okay dad what about the maxi skirt I don 't mind doing that you worship I often to get in the wheelchair with them yep he 's been down but if the reason was it did Giants concerned about whipped until I explained him when I which hospital me get the idea i would have no one around me to be incognito because they brought up to really interesting points why would someone go would say guess going straight in the middle the road in the wheelchair the reason being it was easier than using the footpath now actually actually experienced that and so I 'm going along we have a move of a counselor body to be on that place here I 'll move nestling see if I can still pack

not of those trucks get into the center of wellington and when I went through various features in relationship to other areas in the world in New Zealand I found that I believe that some of those

and perhaps a baby you know instead of a two-day you hit a three or four day they might have been able to cover those at the top exchange but the top the topics and key keynote speakers this year we

    "text": "up some of the draft annual plan to assume over you was a punk yes I 'll tell you wish if I didn 't realize that then we going to pass a bolt I had a question and the next one coming up the local authority she 'd services just in regards to the comment and the financial operating within budget and has achieved a reasonable with a reasonable revenue stream it must be costing belonging to that does that he 'll be costing toward that organization are the contribution of the council 's and general towards these services is about 80,000 a year spread out through the the council 's so our contributions I was spared over the two less is probably 15 to 20,000 that gave us a entry door for example and TV and insurance contract for all of the boepd region so we 're able to guarantee as much as you can in today 's market our insurance cover at the lowest cost based on volume because as a standalone council our ability to negotiate insurance rates a little bit different to a whole Bay of in the shared services world we 've actually been a sort of from that particular on paceman thank you thank you on thanks okay item number 11 adopts are the draft annual plane we have Neil so you and Lisa nice to see your worship and counselors and this report seeks the adoption for consultation of the draft Daniel plan and of the summary document the draft annual plan contains the same projects and the same finances that we presented to the council Larson council workshop which was the one on the 25 februari and since the production of the agenda we found some typos in the report and so what we 've done is we 've done some replacement pages to correct those typos now we send them out with the we send them out and with the councillors weekly update but I 've got some spare copies if people need them there 's an additional Typhon that we found since we produce those and sent them out and that 's on the perspective statement of comprehensive revenue and expense on page 37 we 've also got to revise in the document that we 've highlighted some projects in story boxes basically they 're in two main categories there are those projects that are in the draft annual plan that we want to highlight so things like revitalizing to rang in the continuation of the extended opening hours at the pool into rainy and the waste water projects then there are projects that are not included in the draft annual plan but council is seeking a feedback from the community on and you 'll see there 's information on the enlarged rural fire districts and whether we want to be involved in that whether we leased the space beside the lake terrace viewing platform whether we have a digital screen outside the eyesight and whether we sell the two for us to a street car park so those are projects that are included for feedback summary document as you 'll see has also been worked up substantially since the agenda item and those projects are included in that and Lisa do you want to say anything about the summary will be mailed out to the out-of-town race edition possession densely entertaining so absolutely can acquire a very bright and visual approach as opposed to being quite tasty be as yeah hopefully no more we 're also planning a number of consultation events and with the community we are going to the monthly grape our meeting we 're attending the two rang year after five meeting will be outside wit calls again this year in Talpiot will also be at the top of water treatment plant opening and we 're going to be in the mall in to running and we 're going to have a joint meeting with the business community on the tenth of April the GLC and we 're also going to manga keno and we 're particularly going to the Hui hat in manga keno now last year on Arkansas consultation events we had at least one counselor at each of those events and we found that hugely beneficial so if you 're keen have got a list which we can circulate and you can let us know which events you 're able or willing to rim attend as it does help a lot and as summary I do need to amend my suggestive resolution and by adding the words with amendments because what you 've received in your agenda item isn 't quite what we 're asking you to adopt as a draft for consultation you have a crystal ball Furies counselor just my name something you thinking you wish it just just looking this prospectus type of communist the revenant expense which is a page 57 for the generator number 11 draft in your plan now I 'll just try to simmer I put the new thing that doesn 't sensitive change the point is obvious it 's easy to pick up for an answer from a shout of these reports and the learnings of data can be a dangerous thing so I just wonder to attend suggest mr. Worf with respect to run like at the end your plan the mid Davis about the Texas 559 million the forecast for this next coming years for 290 2000 and in your plans is one coordinate for that that reduction for 5.4 the one point a prefix set 3.65 which is presumably the increase in just obviously when people say talk about balancing the books people think maybe 20 tell us a better you just explain why those still are in the brackets please certainly it 's not on earth is this working like I sound trick or just talk loudly job yeah I think all the volumes gone on to Aeons Mike right okay where do we get to the okay the year the balanced budget the so the the 1.8 million that 's shown there is still reflective of the fact that it 's a third year the financial strategy in that we are pioneers it sales the final year for the es it sales to be applied to to balancing the books and so so that is what that is reflected off and does that answer the question just the cousins just in the information freshman three versus human the information the agenda we got literally a partially complete one of these I see on this one here Scotland the rates etc and the end senator which the other one doesn 't have on taobao percent so we say we finished our what exact information your pension I don 't solar focus won 't fit on this profit wouldn 't have the figures that are on lists here about what the senator rates are going up and down he 's going to get less pay this rate we don 't pay more it wasn 't any fear that were given the agenda however that information was supplied to you in the twentieth of every council meeting a bigger part in a workshop the copy was also sent out on Friday according to Lisa just very quickly you worship in the eleventh to on our agenda this sand wedge they 're a lot like Carly change comments may prepare on the basis of the direction provided by counsel through workshops if you go through the 25th or februari motions the logistics of how something takes place at no stage we had the chance to debate what 's in that in your plan in regards of any cost increases and could have just asked mr. Ward that part of the due process we were to go through was the fact we have that meeting was then table that would finalize the draft and your plan on the seventh March and then would approve it today being the 25th of March that did not take place and I 'm not prepared to accept this annual plan go for consultation to infer instance I 've just been handed this piece of paper today I can 't read that in five minutes and I 'm not to make a decision one way or the other but I certainly want some debate in some of the areas that we can still prove better than what we have now I don 't_''_650.56 I don 't want to hold the process up but even to effect that the wording such as council will fund the shortfall from run rates from property and forestry sales I 'm still trying to get my hand around that because if you 're still on another three-point-something million but that short for other than the point nine is going to come from that why are we asking for more money but it 's the procedure that 's taken place that I utterly disagree with I ask the other part back to the top table um with respect to the statement here that was handed out today the numbers in here other exactly the same as what 's in your agenda item what I do to draw your attention to is what and this is what we alluded to earlier in the chief executives report is that we are trying to align the annual report layout to be identical to the annual tour in your plan layout so the only changes here are actually taking the area that says acid development and other gains and losses the four lines there is taking that 2.9 million dollars out of the number that was in review and popping it down there so there is that there is absolutely no overall change in the numbers that is an account here is actually for clarity that were made the change so it 's the same information that was provided in the agenda your worship I mean out need to know which again are we talking about are we talking about the draft in your plan because as mr. around Williamson top figures and I haven 't gone blind yet the total income figures shown or total revenue are totally different and the handout we 've been given and what 's actually in the draft annual plan and that 's exactly what I 've explained to you counselor is that we have taken 2.9 million dollars out of the 77 it is now shown below under acid development to other games which was a close alignment or the counting treatment if you look at the bottom line figures 5 09 3 it is identical so you wish it kneel on page 57 mm this document here yes I just want to follow what you just said it says income rates on this page here says revenue you know you include in water supply so I 'm there 's different so when you say things have been moved down can you just explain a little bit clearer of whether because it 's difficult just to pick if it wasn 't i right I didn 't wait on this or something like that did some I I understand the question very clearly um little bit slower looks like certainly I have a habit of talking too quickly I apologize and I guess the most important point I guess is that first line are the one that 's his rights revenue um you know edit them on both copies it is 58 235 so I guess it 's the first and most important point i 'd like to make said the amount that we 're saying that we need to click on the community has not changed it is the same thing so um what we have done is we have alliance the here how to explain this in there are many ways that you can present account information what we 've tried to do is to align it in the most correct and consistent manner with the annual report going forward um hints we have if you look on the handout and field of the way down the page says that area this is esset development and other gangs losses you 'll see this full lines there i 'm starting vested assets development to financial contributions are the games and losses subsidies and year people previously that set up in the in the total ribbon sorry total income line so if you add the city 5007 in the two 911 you 'll get back to 77 917 so what we 've done is we 'll just move to down into a new section and the reason that we 've done that is it 's what 's called capital revenue ok so as I say it 's an attempt at clarity in actual fact um because you have four items here what is classed as capital revenue which doesn 't directly affect the rate loan so what we 've tried to do is to show that below the line which is quite consistent with how I a number of other councils do it and I personally as a you know as a accountant for too many years i can remember quite frankly and think it it 's a far better way of presenting financial information so we tried to make it more more clarity to the route to the reader end up but however i do apologize that we have actually shown up let unfair so can you just point me to a second second one down it says profit on sale of property assets where that where 's that now on this page we give handed to us the rights under other gangs and losses okay the third bullet point editing that is part of that number it is not the owners are not separated out I know this right a spot as part of other gains and losses which foreign it 's just that if you 're 21 41 Mitch you won 't be able to see that there won 't be able to okay so guess look back I think not sorry so sorry just a question around their drug in your plane to me which looks lovely Lisa and under and about our finances box on the front page it took us about the additional point nine Percy I 'm just asking the salon you 're normally asked it the point nine percent in rates planning to deliver current activities of council same level of service which to me is operational right right and then you go to the second that and this year we 've been able to cut out just over a hundred K from our operating it says why that might not sound around equates to a zero zero point two pc decrease in rates which means there is no rate increased due to our operational costs and I just to my bid to me that does make things what doesn 't make sense in what may seems to me but attempted to the average sort of normal personality who rates this to me that seems like a contradiction okay um slightest bit of read it again oh no no what about stuff trust me um within the three elements there 's depreciation is interest in his net operating costs is referring to need operating costs in that 's great and I know that there be an explanation for a bit back to the common p I 'm not I don 't mean to go over to them to the normal for the full full-time person out there who picks us up and leave it because they 're not made x withheld document does it not see 't all have your wonderful brain mr. walls done cancer pack good idea you wish anything else just you wouldn 't you look the council Williamson subsidies in grants to be a mess of increase from seven forty eight thousand to 2.2 million hard times I sender and the and your friends of the near tuna Scott it 's about the fourth line down on income I 'd say this is the one on any boom de yada yada to beautify your on the issue of others what do you wanna see me before the year yep okay so what you need to do is you need to add that 40 97 with a 748 which is down on that new section look for them so I 'll explain what that is in terms of an subsidies and grants it 's made up of two components you have what 's called an operating and subsidy and grand so it 's from NZT the easiest explanation there was in CTA so we get a subsidy on a maintenance program there so that 's for the 1497 is and there be a and then any subsidy that comes through on the renewals program or new capital words as what 's called a capital revenue or capital grant and that 's what 's now reflected in the new section so if you add the two together you 'll come back to the other number and again i apologize it would have been a damn sight easier if I just gave you one and not to one 's of these paper to look at sorry for then you should the comments be made about another 1.1 million needed for depreciation the figures that I gained out of the document you gave us on the twentieth of februari which is this one here that document my total came 288,000 why is there a difference the thing I 'm really trying to point out what we 've been given one hang of a lot of material to look at which seems to change almost on a daily basis now I don 't think that is fair to us as counselors now if I said to someone what 's bovine somatotropin you might not know is you with something that it changes almost on a daily basis so the depreciation was just one if you can explain to me why this document had 188,000 and you 're saying we need 1.1 million more extra bits say it is a good Christian counseling and you know ignite said the eye I disagree with a changin on daily basis but I know certainly accept some weekly basis I know I should disagree with that as well because the numbers are actually the same but it does require further explanation the bottom line is this is a billion-dollar business it 's a large corporate entity it has a very complex financial structure it 's must meet international financial reporting standards as well as the financial financial reporting and prudence regulations of the Act so sadly I would love to be able to present something that is nice and simple to you that you might run for a small business or which most people in tap over used to sadly the Lord does not allow us to do that for this large corporate entity however I 'm getting back to your has I can see his has come in and you 're presenting these financial statements would she are presented in a way that complies with the aforementioned or first standards in financial reporting regulations we have to have to report what is known as total comprehensive income okay so so that incorporates all Accounting disclosures and in the methodology by which you must report income and expenditure you do need to look at how much actual cash you need to run the business though I 'm not one in the same you made my analogy that I can use the other that perhaps the lay person or small business person may understand is that you have your you have your set of books so your accountant does for your interview and then you have your set of books and I 'm sure you will appreciate having been in business at they 're both two separate sets of books and two super numbers it is a similar sort of thing here for council so with respect to depreciate so in respect to the numbers that are reported through the statement of cash requirement to fund the council there are certain adjustments that are made and I guess that perhaps the simplest explanation or two simple explanations i can give for that is one of them is is the the asset sale component we were applying in terms of setting the rates were a pine and some asset sales and subsidies in the second one which i think is possibly hopefully a more better understood one in a race directly to depreciation is that accounting requirements require us to disclose sorry to a third one hundred percent of the depreciation include on the our transportation assets however in a funding perspective we receive a forty seven percent subsidy from in CTA so what all councils sir new zealand do is they must report a hundred percent of the depreciation and through the books however when it comes to sitting awaits and we don 't want to double dip the community so we only collect the fifty three percent depreciation and cash that we need because we 're receiving on the other hands a subsidy line which is showing under subsidies and grounds from the NZTA for that so getting back to the Christian around appreciation when you 've gone through and added up the cost of service statements which you clearly have done I 've done the same thing myself and you note that the value that you get in depreciation near however the difference between we were actually click to your cash is the 1.1 million dollars and so it 's not solely to do with in CT is to do with the ETA and a few other factors as well what I 'm trying to do is to bait a simple example of how you get a difference between the accounting disclosure and in the cash requirements required to fund the business I hope that has assisted I hope it has to just on the back no snow no most fun it 's just fact um who are I 'm so I 'm confused by your Christian or lease up to so between 0 and 150 or to look at it another way 150 or less yeah okay hold on let me just say she ready the game cuz I oh yeah oh yeah okay so 150 all this this includes negative is that fair fight yes I can see you I can see that yeah I 'm so perhaps we can sharpen up on the word in there okay yeah worship I don 't hit one questions are so pleased with justice more a matter of policy um it says obviously we go out to consultation for this but then it says and the documents that we have that there are some limits on how much can be changed before new consultation is required can you please quantify or clarify for that exactly we talked about this and we talked about this in the workshops and that is that where there 's something significant also it just goes down to whether its significance just all right remove the jazz it 's still quite a hard hugs and leisure to make but it 's something that we have to be mindful of the moon deliberations will you wish one still not happy we can 't actually change in one of these are thrown back tears that part of it was for them I think so I asked you on Thursday votives in the office of that we as councils yet have not had a debate on things that we can change before it goes to consultations now don 't want to bring up in this forum by the world if I 'm pressed some of the areas that I think need serious looking at as we go page by page through that annual plan there are some areas there that we can I believe that we can alter one of the things we haven 't done once again when we we have all these really caught the differentials we have 11 11 now why out the generators 1.1 or 1.2 wires commercial accommodation 1.8 not 1.7 we just talked this morning we had enterprise and destination is areas that we can move that won 't be substantially changing it till next year 's long-term plan so I can see it 's over-the-top Taylor 's room ready to give an answer but I 'm far from happy want to commit on there no candle is be happy it 's not heavy ability to make changes so the impact on the community is not as large a summer for instance and yoga the art immediately is the remissions part of the right yes so therefore hypothetically in my particular case on sittin on 400 does that remain the same or is it reduced because when you start looking at some of the problems what 's actually carrying its baggage this next year 's the last year supposedly lyst unless there 's some serious cases where this will be taken off and I 've suggested to mr. Ward that maybe at some stage he could give me an indication as the long to implanted what we may be looking at 4 15 16 I don 't want to be sitting here this time next year doing a long-term plan when by Jupiter we 've got a major problem still I am very nervous about that as far as along to implant is concerned that we addressed a lot of those metas in this particular calendar year it won 't be you sitting here this time next year and as far as who 's that they 're subsidizing the higher value properties until the higher value properties fully fully funding in their own right another words the remission has been used up their admission policy was as as per the long-term plan it 's an unfortunate and basis upon which we operate with the long-term plan and drives so many aspects of our business we would love to be able to be a lot more flexible to you but issues of differentials and things of this nature the rules are the rules as far as what we could operate under and that 's a long-term Plane scenario not an annual Plane scenario for javi just regarding remissions it 's my understanding that we do have the right to extend those remissions yes there 's part of the remission policy that was agreed to in the last long-term plan it was to be reviewed at the end of the three years so that was part of the massive workload that we will in this room we 've got to face in the months ahead okay okay we 've got two suggested ammended resolution their council summary of the draft in your plan with amendments and part 2 council consults with the community unity we have their chance to say in accordance with the local urban act 2000 so do I have a movie you worship we 're not going to be discussing anything that 's in the annual plan that we may belt altar you can do that right now if you want to well I would start on page one and we 're through it 's going to take a couple of hours then you then again if we 'd have that meeting on the 7th of march maybe some of these points will you be clarified which could have been a breeze okay just to clarify so you could counsel body sub thank you alright have a mover caster pack ticketed by Councillor Stewart all those in favor please say aye those against oh that recorded please 11 against everybody against resolution is carried thank you we 'll just adjourn for a five minute break and come back for item 12 thank you _"

    "text": "aight on to item number 12 yeah I 'm your worship yes just to let you know that I 'm councillor Truman 's given her apology she got home she shy LOL ticularly row ok thanks to let he 's honest way yep great Hera yeah we should how are you councillors go thank you this is an item number 12 adoption of the draft tree in vegetation policy purpose of this item is to adopt the draft train vegetation policy for a public consultation and also to establish an dead hawk Hearing Committee and to hear any submissions it may be received that would include appointing five elected members and nominating one member is a convener to start the hearing and initiate the election process for a cheap ism and the the background information to this is as we covered and the in the council workshop and and I can run through the key changes for the draft and trim beach policy if you like if you want me to go through those well quite an opportunity to read the item we 've had that workshop previously I suppose kara probably would that be okay sure hello the council 's feel about that I just like to make a comment that this is definitely a far better layout so there to the current policy and um yes I think it was differently what I think so that easy to read I 'm just also point out that and unfortunately when it comes to doing edge in doesn 't hearing to hearing right numbers and it became a copy on a copy so the policies actually do have colored boxes around them but that hasn 't shown up and let so hopefully that 'll either clarify those policies okay thank you usually yes el sabado scratch I that congratulate you on me on the document now you should just know the maintenance offense a thick with a separate item sometimes they can feel the page back the biggest concern that I 've had with which I think 's addressed in here is the ability some trees to be removed and the archaic system we have at the moment and I student welcome those changes and I think they came through cancel buddy any other questions of Kara okay so we 're looking for a 55 counselors or how many we wish five-year make a million five okay so let 's see product it honestly just um worship is so a reason why the tree and vegetation policy on the reserve dolphin which is kind can 't_''_195.91 do this particular is there a reason that we need a adult committee or no prob yeah we should buy I agree with counsel hit clings comment it makes sense to me that committee ceases policy through because the other ones are going to need to implement it and already have an understanding and background so when I say those people on the bench for that one degree what an extra person on if you on likewise if you wiggle on that committee near if anyone wants to 4 is 4 or John enjoyed through you you wish your wedded slight difference i noticed in the last year it was a meeting of that committee that elected the chairman and there 's two people here i think one of them won 't have to it for a committee as that is the quorum to yes there 's a big movement ya got for just wonderfully like an appropriate I 'm yeah he 's mean developing a duration as well you wish if I 'd recommend we do change the delegated authority of the reserves and what what was the procedure oh god I recorded so take the two reactor where it 's been moved by Councillor hair clean thinking it secular council body hi all those in favor please say aye is it scary item number 13 yeah that makes I was wondering it myself adoption of the triennial agreements with the regional councils so next not a sale a your worship and councillors Ariel could be here some dipping into issues the only comment I 'll make once we have no questions that after each part of the accused of resolution we 've got with them with recommended amendments of the imprecatory that 's simply there for the occasion we you wish to make some suggested changes if you don 't want to make any changes then we 'll just remove those from do want to make changes just be aware that they will need to go back to all the other members who will sign the triennial agreement so there 's a process involving Christians or queries of mr. crusher so John 's toast small question sir mr. cow do you know where the other councils are in terms of signing these agreements as well you know whether at them have stopped okay and the only other comment I had which was just a really small one on 13 bar 11 8 section D it says this is the Bay of Plenty agreement as there 's given the importance quarter to these agreements all the other councils give the Emir and CEO all right to go there and then it has gotten brackets in case of the district council we can just seemed in uni but we can just send other representatives is that the message we want to seem to Bay of Plenty believe that say yum their arrangement the workplace during the last cranium there may be something you wish to I just interesting other councillors views with a you at all I don 't it just means that you know particular councils are interested they can gauge I think I think there was no recognition of the fact that because type was in the Bay of Plenty and the Waikato sometimes we 're conflicted in terms of which meetings we can get to and so that was a recognition that if there 's a particularly important item being discussed in the bay but we have to go to the Waikato then we can send a substitute like the deputy mayor to the Bay of Plenty and that person will be recognized thank you okay any other questions or queries for Nick okay should I go mover we 've got the cousin cigna by councillor jolons all those in favor please say aye all right eyes against Kerry item number fourteen psychoactive substance substances hello Jane hi as you 're well aware and your the timings were bad for this particular submission so your office is basically draft of the submissions so any changes basically you worship just point of procedure I noticed on page 14 3 it stated internal understand that because of the way our meetings are you were able in cases like that would it be appropriate maybe to get some counselors to come as well I know there 's at least one counts are on this table it 's not meet its very interested in the subject agree with them just to bring the castles up to date you say we 're all quite a substantial brawl outside the particular venue that these substances sold this morning so certainly quite a topical where a subjective moment end of course hamilton city if lodge day here they are by law no it 's the local approved products policy they 've have approved the policy and it 's in the process of being reviewed by the authority I think that 's a little bit of a misnomer that 's out in the media at the moment I hope to basically explained all this to you on the first of April any other questions yet have been challenged quite considerably Honor I believe the industry is going to whether the lawyer has basically said that they 're going to again I think the media is yeah I 'm not one hundred percent certain what 's true and what 's false on the media they seem to be taking particular line and that yes it 's definitely going to be a showcase yeah so I suspect some of these counts some of us will be getting queries and questions s to the operation is legal at the moment we cannot do anything about it correct is it yeah it 's a complicated scenario and and basically the legal highs are legal and but again if there is a product out there that can cause harm and even all of us right now can find the authority to basically lodge a complaint that 's what the afford is an lovely our 800 number that everyone can rent and and they have actually already banned five substances all right okay r is missing he make the submission okay counselor Jolin signum by counsel Williamson always on favor please say aye aye against Kerry okay item number 15 notice emotion that 's the body thank you your worship I won 't spin on ago that large gap between the December and every meeting I noticed with local diamond online that the number of councils met at the end of the end of January so the gap wasn 't is great and I think we had a couple of issues during that time which maybe if we counsel have we met we may have been able to to take action on it I 'm pretty happy with there 's any amendment to know yourself sir mention that maybe we should meet in the first tuesday of every then at the last tuesday of every I 've just put this issue before us find out whether we want to have that extra meeting so I formally move their top of the it 's a picnic and yeah okay Castle clean yeah i 've only got sort of one minor comment i think it was the December one she made about the third Tuesday in the month it would be around about of 16 next year it 's the 17th couldn 't look at the calendar for any further but it would have seemed I would third Tuesday in December so because we always meet on a Tuesday and the other of the februari one refers to tuesday the last tuesday in january in the third to tuesday in december just as common you are worship um my comments am I I agree with John that we need an extra meeting I think we just need to think very carefully about when we have that meeting because council staff need time to prepare these agendas we spend a long time reading them but they spend a long time putting them together if we have something that 's too close to Christmas and we want to action stuff we 're running out of working days to do that so i would suggest the tensor to sip well we had one earlier in december didn 't we last year 's sticking to us that night and then if we come back either yeah either late january or early februari because you people need to get back and get on board too don 't they so December meeting is normal does not yeah yeah as normal yesterday it 's counselor Jones but also just to add the human element to it that you know if you 're looking at the third tuesday before christmas grew up with people with family commitments and a lot of other other bits and pieces school holidays I likely to start around their time it just may hinder both council staff in elected members and and lead out to the festa SI don 't you wish I could I just point out it hasn 't got a second day yet yep sure so we can possibly mean this now I 'm sorry you need a second there before it can be debated then it could be mean yeah okay and one deflate system yes you 're singing before the resolution is Lizzie 00 or should I just discussing how is it my focus is on the January meeting okay v what I 'd like to say here is that if there 's not enough business and I need turned out back for a meeting that there 's not much business so we were this some words could be rare met as businesses there we in January but if there 's not you 're realizing what you said before you know the officers need about a week to 10 days prior and a lot of people are away at that time a year that 's the natural fit for a lot of people 's holidays so you know if its lack of business you know we should just not have a meeting for the sake of having a meeting I think of this am I just like to put that out there so that you 're aware if you were looking at having a meeting in January at the fourth Tuesday a month a gene does from staff would head to be in tone us by about the fourth January what about the first week in febrian I mean you 'll be producing your your time in terms of stuff coming back so so that it would be more staff available not on holiday what are other councils do I was going to say you can always it can always call an emergency meeting your worship if this well yeah get important issues to do actually what I would want to avoid is having a lot of routine stuff going through that happen tactics is a reflection that that way to be included to deal with the important issues then I don 't see a major issue except lies I think we could probably the first tuesday of every deal with everybody so so it gives extra meeting that that 's a little too if every stall have you do that for two weeks in advance so it gives everybody the ability to reach a flat iron and what about the december i really feel a spectacle tuesday signal state we go to second to his daughter just impact my case the move are you ganya hippie I felt I 've had a problem with your standing orders over another issue talk to mr. Jake 's a bit I think what you need is somebody had to move an amendment that the SEMA behold as is I do you have if you have a februari one because and then you debate that and it didn 't you think being gets past but though I feels in Phoebe I didn 't have a problem with that all I wanted was to get it on the table she 'll appreciate them okay do I have a move for that how many tales secant it moved and seconded ah did your head how 'd you learn one thing so did it up sorry natus against a in cancer cousins faith you can we have so it 's an amended resolution has been moved you see just to annoy everyone can I change into Thursday would sleep may if you don 't mind mistreatment of units inside okay amended resolution has been moved against the cousins and secretive breakouts of John Lowenstein don 't be it 's the one choose our tuesday after December meeting as per normal have been to meetings in February I just know you have any not ok so do commentary around there be moved in sick of it cancer javi I would presume you were having me on a good idea actually you wish we put the amendment I 've the right to speak just to make covered concert of you may we talked last meeting november december 12 thats that becomes null avoid also the fact of the mention for local government online had a number of councils that actually met and been in january but been saying that i 'm quite happy with it but with the outcome we gotta get right all those in favor hi those against carried okay _"

Fox that is correct your worship and we also live an exhausted or funding inquiries or income inquiries in relation to these generators that 's an ongoing discussion with some other major retailers it 's just follow that out we quite came and looking at corporate citizenship sort of partnerships and which and the Civil defeat sort of arena is working really well particularly and hamilton at the mystery creek field days where um the the mystery creek um event center has gone to town on board with saul defeats and they 've actually set themselves up when there was work building and kemp add team sites on the field days it 's all the show grounds so we could possibly put a sponsor 's name on these things absolutely we 're open open to to any anything in particular Thank You mr. Bowden any other um this is requirement under section 10 of the eight and we 're going to have a couple of generators here in Taupo that 's on the presumption or the assumption that if something happens we can all get to the center of town Oliver naka half the bridge cries out I can 't get in what about wide to nuit download that why haven 't they got one down there I 'm just wondering we get we get very emotive about the subject but are we actually providing is a bit like we 're going to go into the risk management the one that canceled apart went to because putting the two generators there who 's it going to serve you can think of chapeau will choppers all out view as well so I just like a bit of information on that you could come via of landslides like your next shot as well I mean this is the problem that we 've got we 've got all these ideas but in practice they don 't often work really desire you wish that I would 've thought and in a an emergency of the next you 're talking about and it 's far easier to get the residents of white avenue e tutto Paul whether it be by both or whatever than it is to get people from taupe or two by two her nuit it doesn 't have their infrastructure and place two shafts of people who made the local and full of volcanic air show boat won 't work there 's a couple of big lean slides as you go around how to be so I 'm just I 'm just throwing this out there that we tend to get very emotive lips to it what 's the benefit for all of us I 'd tell me great that one thing I most central location it 's lillian also you need to just like we 've looked at this morning with the flood hazard scenarios rather than extreme what about one generator through you he wishing I 'd see in emergency management the back road none he said obviously you 've had and put into this fall and and this is obviously the best the best location the best system available you 're the man on the ground we compromise and also through the directive cleaning on Venus the rottenness connect communities include to locate backup for business continuity chains for our business development for movement through mr. chill these these venues were actually firstly selected by ministry and the DHB from Emory Philip that 's correct some time ago they were identified as being the most logical source okay thank you okay with a suggested resolution the year that we procure this you know and possibly i 'm suggesting probably an amendment with a we could seek sponsorship the naming of these it 's already because I presume sighs yeah I could just see that the press release we had a power cut last night but don 't worry the contact pad our generator kicked in and at the gate like Sanders say repair okay so just the resolution needed i have a mover or I 'll move the suggesting resolution you wish would think you can select link seconded by Councillor pack all those in favor please say aye I am those against carried thank you item number seven mr. Lewis we should have a tinder for the young district refuse and recycling collection had let 's take the one proposal written and take any questions Thank You counsel park yes I 'd this is a very simple question and so stupid well you talk about conforming Tina 's I mean Oh tears of tenders and we 're accepting an opportunity of tina from um yeah after a their conforming tender and i just not quite sure i 've looked at the definitions but if you could if explained to me that a very severe it 's a very simple answer for you a conforming team drew 's one where it conforms alone speaks for the request for tender so the tent and request between two seats out what you are looking for and a conforming tinder apps as all of those something slightly different to what the original team de was asking that does it still component yes move on under the losers well i understand what the contractor would have to put in a controlling tender before they put an alternative turned on this all right such size said sorry worship that so what 's different with the alternative tender from the component in der then good right mmm Thank You cycling so mr. Lewis um I 'm a little bit concerned about the ten-year surface for the contrary because that 's basically if the contractor performs and the renewal period is more or less a given correct do you think ten years and I consider some savings with the ten-year period let you know look in 10 years we so long time to let a contract things might change of or really prudent to go to the 10-year option we are going to receiving the contract yeah but these are aggressively nose and those on set and you 've asked my question it is an automatic two-year three-year so it is a ten-year contract that will it smells that he performs to his contract it 's more or less automating right great he 's performing like anyone in life or they perform they carry on this placement or is it praying for us to take the option of the 10 year as opposed to the seven year which is the five-year contract here are the stated financial and advantages for taking you along the contract on the basis of the tender price submitted for both the conforming tinder any alternative tender we have only received one tinder for this antenna and that is the incumbent um he 's had the current contract for like at six years ago okay hey I 'm still a little bit uneasy about tenure in worship but on I can see there 's some savings but there 's also savings in five-year contract too because it still goes to seven okay counselor pack yeah just just on their F and and faraway since is limited bridges to change ownership what had been happens to their contract the contract will transfer to the next little new owner hmm there you worship for Johnson mr. Louis similar thinking to counselor heckling about the tomb but then when I added up the numbers i worked out it was nearly a million dollars worth of savings to this community which can 't really be ignored um but um in terms of the extra financial enticement to go can we ask them to consider that for the five-year contract to go back or is that not if I mean we 're not asking me to see it up any separate infrastructure to extend the service that 's not costing them anymore i 'd say probably double a bit and then calculations that they will be setting up extra infrastructure but sorry i didn 't your words in the question you worship as i read the agenda item we have two alternatives we either accept the seven-year contract with right of renewal for two plus two make it tap or we can accept the five-year contract with the right of renewal one plus one which will make it seven is that correct is loose I know you 're a resolution don 't say that if this person has put a survivor accepting the five plus two plus one of them or the seven plus 2 plus 1 i 'm through a cheer you 've got an opportunity here to pay 45 thousand dollars plus a year lease on the same since the reason why the price for the and sealingly contract is cheaper it means that they can speed the cost of the capital invested over a longer period therefore they don 't need to get as much revenue so basically your decision is do you want to spend an extra 45 thousand plus and where to get the same you work as you could do by having a sydney a contrabass a five-year contract you wish good at what what you do i would take the long the contract and it 's obviously a here at the market that I mean based on the fact we are go on tinder then doesn 't give us a lot of choice you would you want to just ask and the last council of my fixed to create you know we have the bank bags because the pig stickers on and we those yellow bags are a defect owned by waste management not by us great why was that allowed in the previous contract and as it still welcome to this one is wheelies in revenue refuse controversially has a different culture it was my mistake the only at the scene in person yeah yeah direct the green bin I was talking about her in bed George yes so they it was an opportunity for the council to stay in the market of service provision as well as piggyback the coastal object service provision bias private service provider so what we 're actually getting is we 're able to stay in the market and provide alternatives to the yellow bag which is our sticker which is half a sticker we give the option for a smaller refuse disposal at the curb side by during the sticker in half we allow other mail the contracted a piggyback on that service and then we 'll take and pay some of the cost of actually providing the truck service going around the road so we can label the contractor to be able to to keep we jump out in the marketplace we would therefore enable the monopoly situation the price would rise so so by staying in we offer a difference in service delivery and the ability to keep the price at a at a rate that 's affordable for the community it 's same time through you you wish are we talking about those bags or some other factors you lost me for instance is the contract we looking at for the refuge refuge and recycling is those is the bags that they can now sell three mega might attend another it 's still part of the contract so the citizens at the moment of the choice between the two and at the moment i believe the yellow slightly cheaper but I just like to know whether that 's still part of that contract ok so the contractor is allowed yes to piggyback on the service delivery there 's no there 's no way that we can stop them or anybody else Camille to the market it 's a user pays market so if you wanted to start start business tomorrow and offer a you meet some criteria baru which is you know we look at the conditions of operating in the marketplace so there 's nothing that we could do to stop any operator coming into the marketplace by pick by allowing your contractor to piggyback we actually get some benefit Seattle for the community you worship I 'm not worried about anyone else coming to the market mr. Lewis might be answer this that made answer this figure that they 've offered in the tender does that take into account what they may or may not make out of the yellow bags so for instance they got a dollar a big is going across the dollar fifty are going to pay for it you see so they can sell the BB let me correct I could man so that when I don 't know how they 've made the timber up okay I just one question ahead this particular contractor has been doing curbside collection for how long section is the uncomfy and have we have been a good contractor we should many first suggested resolution thank you can second seconded by aye i was against Kerry item number eight we 're shocked we have a contract _"

Jake 's maybe L assist when we did the code of conduct there was discussion we numbered the pages i think that was done cancer cousins just to clarify Rosie for me agree with me it 's not so much traffic injury is there to negotiate yes we didn 't want to do the tender specific it was just we were questioning how with a you know that they had asked for any further clarification on the tender process had they you know actually exhausted everything possible and made sure they got as much as possible from the tender okay so you can mover for those minutes please yes the cousin signal if I can 't go back all those in favor please say aye as against Kerry item number for procedure the minutes of Turing a Tonga Dido community board audit and Risk Committee emergency management committee goes on block of that 's okay so cousins we on with a china man should be living for match like that and also there 's a recommendation the so to me four by five finger plantation three recommendations in school bathroom three two recommendations here yes as a council happy to carry those Mexican recommendations I suppose to activate on those and four bar five regarding the Alliance company and tons of cousins we go through the eye anymore a little bit of a left-field one near because we understood that the Mardi carving the bottom of it and in a drill that came up the trop be disclosed yet it was nice represent to the east groups and then the drilling history as well tunneling under industry that 's actually a counselor stewardess table-topping have you it 's just people aged know what we 're talking about and look look like I 'm facial and could we just play five the the budget will set aside for my staff a sculpture I believe that that is the pas cher my doll doll yes it does so the reading of water what are we agreeing to a council to to take out the who 's funding they 're going but once they and once they have the money from Council secured they regard to the businesses to get the rest of the funds to go to water it will be done 5050 so you know I 'm Webster is in that open stunning in my account presently for this financial year because we 've we 've got those two sculptures out there on rental i would say that we 've gotten dollars okay body clarification so effectively we 're looking at this money 's coming out of the 13-14 budget not 1415 allocated it doesn 't have to be spent just going up to 44 about five just a bit of clarification from the board meeting want to say on the answers going to be but and what could I just have sorry oh apologies I wasn 't at that meeting just a clarification of is that the right wedding or is there still a lasagna Melisandre I 've spoken it with the group that came with the presentation to council and they 're more than happy for us to have a look at the wording and change the wording to afflict they understand that it 's too restrictive if you 're just saying we were out from the lines company and that we need a way forward to get the loans company to change their mind on the method of charging and I 'd also like to ask it um because will call me having the same issues and waitomo trust my Tommy News had a big article in with the other day about how affected by getting with with Andrew people in people on fixed incomes with the same problem that we 're having and I 'd like to ask that through the mayors of some channel we ask those district councils also to do a similar thing everything from the way forward just my understanding just from years of involvement from looking for my queen p.m. what not like prior life and it is actually a legislative change that needs to happen is it great therefore wouldn 't it be better figure on to eat together petition Parliament then do fill in a survival and just 20 today tenant that was part of and what the school want to do that they want to get some feedback from everybody first so that they have something concrete to sort out cliff just so you wish I just it will be in cost so the most efficient way forward in effective way is it 's something that I 'll just think about councillor cousins Coventry my consume wasn 't any number that 's not learn lots of all in the month the devil 's advocate and wish this is do you want have a line companies or no so if we answer for I see yes give what you wish for because please we won 't take us there 's nothing here to go to so I think the lines coming to act responsibly illness the committee is looking for our plus for help yeah yeah Casa dromons three through your worship saying I 'm counselor cousins is right and there is actually no way that that community can actually come off the lines company it 's a monopoly there are no other options so we need to be very careful about how we manage the expectations on what the survey is going to deliver I 'm very supportive of the survey and I take very much comment that I 'm counselor Stewart 's it the other day about helping we came to collect the survey but I think very much we need to be clear that that survey has been the responsibility of that community to take to government whether it 's a petition or whether they go through the Commerce Commission because if the pricing model will be up for discussion in April 2015 so this is a time to be doing this we have spoken to the ruapehu mere and don cameron is very interested in meeting with his worship as well to discuss what these shortly so I think in terms of costs I think the discussion that being that maybe the survey went out in the next rates notice but I would look to maybe the arm council staff to give us some advice on how they should be done and maybe we should work on the wording and get that approved together collectively or it goes out yeah so perhaps I suggest this this pen the wording goes back to the board could the board come back with the correct wording mr. green okay yeah as people feel about that so you come out back with the appropriate wording on that and better pick it up on council john and CDM i 'm more than happy to meet with the mirror of impossibly white omonia by the sound of it too yeah so they are the three sort of technical councils that are involved as such so and then a joint statement from us would be certainly probably helpful but appreciate the community 's expectation yeah we can only do so much with this and help out help here residence out but it of our five for my 7 driver move it from the other twin sister Sonia heckling just before you move for your worship and just on for by 11 it 's right at the bottom and is talking about government risk the staff prepare some information for a workshop and I just wondered if we can keep that in mind when we look Leslie the meeting scheduled until year end of the meeting viewership I don 't want it to be forgotten that song so we so are for the meeting for the meeting yet shop don 't you could just my date bring that up the India to cope okay so there the receipt of the minutes on block to the foundation okay could I have a mover I 'm sorry no matter Holman Christian with lifting and so then it 's going to go out and don 't do it to put something into said we 'll go up with the legs for what we do not the resolution apparently so so I 'll just leave it is it that that would be the ideal way to do than the right demand with the news leader and whatever obviously we don 't want to see any other separate no I 'm area bear in mind this is TT yep during eat i 'll rewrite would not have enough totally yeah okay move for those peanuts

planning exercises where the key decision points in terms of progressing to the next stage of development over the mat just the report to clarify will continue to have a busy time and then was very successful again this year and that staff have been very actively engaged in making sure that opal remains the place that we notice for that events and that summer season so happy to take questions councillor Dolan 's I 'm three worship Rob just one question and the report we usually include the organizational measures as well and I didn 't see them in this report but a reference to saying they 'd be covered in April with there any reason why they weren 't included computer the organizational measures so the bonus doesn 't do culture over though makes you mention in the report that they were going to be in April but I usually see them every month then I or by Miss weakness Oh double check on you for that you buddy turn on them 513 stay sir j higher than being due to the SFO investigation how much higher were illegally to but i think it 's in the region of 25 to 30,000 be CFO domestication are you able to get those exact figures please thank you thank you any other questions or queries Counsell Williams your worship this related person to us relating over a couple questions relating to report both couple questions later later agenda you live in button on the page 5a Scott 's the full-year budget for finance costs delivering million and the forecasters and ten points to a million so this is good useful obviously but to this change from my favs last two months sorry five by eight Boyd Barrett Browning 's costs we were really visiting a full cast every month now I mean we felt it was prudent to bring date the forecast on the planets and planets expenditure because we are below budget use it actually there 's just with regard to page 14 certain this the last two months other items I don 't not that one is specific there 's another one point four million dollars an extra items what would be a major is it a major cupon de things in some cost we don 't know we don 't have a bill for until the end of the year so without me going they can irreversibly the course our I can 't comment I 'm sorry any other questions of various cancer cousins open of the mic through human just on 521 I 've got too far ahead of myself I just on the bond lyricism fit on your town centre revitalization I just want to say thank you to Andrew Beldon for your exceptional work down there on a community so thank you for that sorry sunroof Andrew Andrew Biden oh well done you wish this morning William settle more I could jump to add you know everything with regard pencil a financial crap item five so you want my carriage yeah okay so you got the chief of teachers report council Truman yeah I just source i want to say and under the project performance and just as part of the projects can the making or revitalization so that the civic center in the lakefront reserve we put an ear like the toilets were finished as looks like most animals not included again so here this 'll body just doesn 't put a clarification restored i 'll pick this up subscribe through the annual pain process if we go back to last year 's and your fam 13-14 when it comes to finances you have a net deficit in brackets surplus of operations but the document we 're looking at the moment and the way through with the annual fancy surface ever certain brackets is the reason for that change Topher the reason for the changing the break-ins yeah whenever so I 'm assuming that we 've never got sipping that a new plan of last year surpluses and brackets off the figure at the end of columnas and brackets its surplus we were now saying that the deficits of brackets I 'm just wondering why we 've changed that around I have no idea actually but some i bum try i 'll show you then your plan just to start with the Dominican figures like that and we also seem like you don 't that when we do the any plan the figures that have the format is doesn 't match up with the simplicity of last year 's annual plant it might just be me I just on the format um the annual plan that you 're going to be receiving later on is in the same format as us what we try to do in this report is to give you a format that is very similar to the inner report so that when you receive the annual report you 're not looking at something that is completely different and the past the annual plan has been slightly different in this year we have tried to make it the same so that you 're looking at the same data I can 't comment on the brackets though well one of the problems with them trying to get things simplistic is that is not a simplistic business and we have requirements interests and and a gap so his genius just saying that will weave funds be able to work on with the annual plan is getting more of that term correct alignment with the annual plan within your report which is ultimately the order hand the other will come in the annual plan item to get that closer alignment there and I guess the break it example might maybe am example of that counselor we were young perhaps we were yeah isn 't due today you can show me the way as long as you explain what it is but I I acknowledge the confusion and we try to take the confusion out is consistent with the long-term plan and the other tests that no one 's actually picked up is the deliberate test we put on page 57 yes I was wondering something in it is but it 's been a long ferry your worship Lucifer was a pig on page five there were looking pretty identify fly by 22 the souvenir plainly Thomas is tossing her yeah you 're 15 25 yeah 3 worship that relates that organizational one I was mentioning as well just use you in the monthly report okay oh

gasps diving in and Jeff for who is of course the council representative on there and also just ignored the board members any lines and the back there and I see if any and their question your manager Fritz and not see thank you Falls yours sir Yatim mr. mayor and councillors and management nice for you today as you can see we have changed it up a bit this time we 've left for it to the back I 'm sure we 'll hear from them sometime during the invitation happily quickly humans call human nature Jeff will be doing most of the presentation today but I just thought I 'd better just advise you Murray gets the time is good that sudadera resigned as the chair this week and as planned sometime last year I 'm will be taking over the chairs roll it was plans are no surprises I think so just decided 's not clear to me right now whether she 's stanyan all together so we 'll try and find that up next time we meet with her relations and thank you for gas potential but just need to ignored so I guess I mean she to me she 's done a fantastic job I met with her when I was asked to ever think about joining the board and she impressed me from day one he certainly had a real passion for that for the whole economic development she did a great job of pulling the team together that we 've got now and an obviously the management team as well so and she 'll be missed I 'm hoping that she is still going to sit around the table that I can 't_''_118.049 say that for sure right now I think it 's a chair my main responsibility really is to ensure that you know the ratepayers get best bang for bucks to use the term and I just need to do that through making sure our trustees and our management keep focused on what 's important what 's tough one that came up the last time we said here is that how do you how do we show you what we 've what we 're achieving and what 's your contribution been to bring in a business here but that isn 't always as easy as it sounds my commitment really is to bring jobs to topol you can call it economic development to me the real economic development i 'm interested in as only if it brings jobs and reasonably good paying job site as well so we remain focused just quickly the just I don 't go to all the trustees but just to show you but we 've this is a pretty fantastic bunch of people assembled held a range of skills from a bit forestry experience entrepreneurship is geothermal so we 've got most the things we believe are important assets the top or covered we have some pretty healthy discussions at our meetings a bit of fun as well but we seem to think we 're getting some good outcomes just to reconfirm out we 've done a lot of thinking about what and what do we have that you know that 's what do we have that other regions don 't have and we sort of still focus on these three on the three main core areas would prices they mean we 're surrounded by wood we had a lot more mills here years ago that we 're down to one big salt in on and I just keep fingers crossed that it 's going to survive because it 's its whole focuses really the u.s. main focus the US market so you know with the sort of exchange rate it must be a bit tougher them we 've got plenty geothermal and there 's a lot of you know there 's a lot of industries that can feed up to your thermal and tourism alone this sense here we 're talking about trying to bring businesses to talk or not not busy as I guess that 's the job of the previous group so they remain our focus we 've got 30 an initiative strong initiative in each one of those here is on the table at the moment as Brett these people are quite keen to keep their names quiet for a while we can 't say whether any of these are going to really come off to anything emits material but they do look really cause of that the wood processing one is not the one that was talked about a year ago it 's another it 's another group so you know we just keep working away and try to make it make the decisions easier make sure there 's no barriers for them that 's our thing and between there 's two or three of us in the forestry game so we can help in that area and with antiglare of course we 've got geothermal covered pretty well so I 'll just hand you over to Jeff now as your reps in it thank you Greg in Council thanks for the opportunity as your representative and thanks to for reappointing me the other day enjoying being honest board and so it 's a good opportunity to report back on the six months and a few of the concentrate on a few of the initiatives that we first is the youth the young enterprise scheme which is administered by EG LT for the for the federal district and essentially it 's a way for to get youth familiar with with business to be business literate the emphasis here is on schools and in particular at the moment triple New Year tier has got a business course in the year 12 the 13 years and the those who get involved in this scheme can in NCAA credits by doing so you probably know about it it 's run as a sort of a competition they come up with a business plans and all the costings and go into a Dragon 's Den type competition for the region we have some of our mentors which I 'll talk about in a minute who judge the regional finals we had a team last year that went to the national finals so I know when I 'm just a couple of years out of school but there was certainly no business education when I was there so it 's good to see that these skills are starting to be taught at will take it up and will support them in it if they do pathways one supported by the mere as this is the initiative that was started by the vin ultra hong amir al williams few years ago which is a way to try and get that the youth who are looking for work to get connected with the employers of the region we 've got a couple people here rose in and then a directly involved so they 'll know about more about the nuts and bolts than I do but the immediate target here is the approximately hundred kids he 'll leave school this year in this district will be looking for work as opposed to those who are going on to further education on the like interestingly a lot of those kids will traditionally you leave the region and find work elsewhere and ironically we 're finding some some companies here are finding a difficult to find workers and they 're going out of the region to find people to bring back here so we can find a way of providing them meaningful work here that 'd a stocktake of what the skills needs our of the various businesses that might be interested in employing people understanding what they are that survey has almost been completed with the next stages to make sure that the the youth understand what skills our required do they already heaven if not what they need to do to get them and then to match them up with each other so hopefully they can find meaningful employment here as you can see there 's a couple of functions coming up employers function in may careers Expo later in july and just like to thank the council for their role here and assisting us particularly with the venue at the great lake center angeleyes is the businessmen tours you can read their that how that 's going there 's been 88 businesses that have been mentored so far through this scheme at the moment the 48 businesses on the go we have 26 mentors great to see that we 've got 26 but we are but concerned that that 's not really sustainable with 2648 means there 's quite a few mentors assisting about a bit of burnout the end this is possibly a place where we all including yourselves might be able to assist if you know of individuals who you think would be good mentors and prepared to to do so then we 'd love to hear and bitters be here in particular who runs us would like to hear it is a bit of a commitment these people volunteer their time for free they have to go through a an induction course or a date one day course to start with us has a bit of structure to it they 're meeting with these companies for usually one day of once a month sorry over a two-year period it starts off at a couple times a month in goes to once so a quite a commitment but we do have a very good in the main good caliber of mental here and with international experience international experience etc and the feedback we 're getting is really positive from this week to the extent now that some of the banks are now referring clients to the mentor scheme because they obviously be successful this is both new businesses and existing ones and we are aware of several instances where where companies have thrown their business grown their employment levels is a direct result of the mentor input that they 've received so this is a great initiative been on to you know about that i won 't go into any detail but from the board 's perspective we 're very happy with how this turned out both with the how it looks with the content how it 's being distributed and i think it shows off our district and what we 've got off in a very positive light so is a business ejection magazine we think it 's it 's working well very big job to put this together obviously and we 're planning on doing this every couple of years so the next one came to do in 2015 and finally just the interaction between ourselves and yourself and in what can you do we obviously see you as ambassadors for this region and all aspects of your work as counselors in and from EG lt 's perspective we the various forums that you find yourselves and to be to be aware of what our region offers our region can offer an end and to talk about that as a positive thing and then those of you I do know a little bit I know you already do this both informally and formally through that the channels with regional and national government the on a more formal basis you you have a role in administrating how business happens here so to make it easy to do business here both for existing businesses which is equally important part of eg Ortiz we can to attract new businesses to make this region or this district known as an easy place to do business as a positive step for us which will hopefully might make the difference between a business starting or not and in here so that ends my cool X Jeff thanks Creek and inquiries questions we should very quickly I have a bit of a dilemma now being a counselor recently the local government act changed in six routine particularly relates to core services now why I certainly for in to post great lake tapper and sometimes wonder whether some of the things you 're branching out into say it could be better handled by say the Chamber of Commerce and I 'm not being negative I 'm just throwing it into the ring because we now charged with certain things that we couldn 't do in the past and so I 'm very keen to have that debate for instance of the monitoring one of the mentoring one if you ring I think it 's our 800 2 09 2009 you get someone to to mean to you to you so I 'm just wondering is it also course part of of enterprise but just throw that out as a question yes I 'll have to think that I can 't give you an answer correct answer except that I 'd suggested it is working well under age alt the mentors themselves are the ones who are spending the bulk of the time on it staff are doing time matching them up but I don 't think it 's eating up that much of our time overall but a community so we 've never gone well it 's under the don t know that the person spice there 's not a lot a lot of harm expect some of these things from our presentations everyone because he makes the whole unit econoline you 23 and is working with us okay excellence any other questions or queries okay and just acknowledge aim down there to the WIC you do ends much appreciated and that certainly excited about that job expo coming up which is which is gratefully out school leavers and the school 's been involved it is certainly well worth the exercise I thank you for organizing that thank you to the council 's a lot I guess one of the limo said that we always face it we represent the business community office so while we are doing we are ready recon how we use it okay we always have to deliver we aimed at addressing a political magazine there really a larger proportion of all of our computers possibly has no advantage from what we do is but the business community equally as you like I disaster I certainly want this town industry that will make a survival community hopefully all the time without a particularly but I guess if we want to go on and make changes in this community and meaningful employment that pays more than forty dollars twenty-five that 's our guest needs before you cancel javi yes sir I just like to ask and I presume that this is what is being done but do you have room in your budget do you have time to visit all the heat officers of all the major corporations and actually go and make personal visits on a regular basis and you know offer our town as you know a prospect for you know many heat off office office facilities that sort of thing you know have we done there have we been to Wellington Auckland Christchurch blah blah blah if we 're possible I 'm sure you have but you know this is just clarification short answer Norbert stretch we believe what we have we have not been as Professor dollar general Astra education we 're like we see it up maybe about 50 of the time spent on on the smaller business community because that is 95 scene of business so we 've acknowledged and are changing freeing up at a time to alarm or their travel to start initiative dattatreya to list all the availability of rental availabilities in the mall down the end and shop that 22 people that might want to come down here we do rely a lot on partnerships I for example epic meeting with the gluten pointin and say we we tryna aim at the slang go to have those buildings they have an interest in tilling hospital hmm to assist them we just don 't have any budget to going then I spent all my time like to but that is just not what we can so we have to make do with what we have and the best we can do is what we have is to pull partnerships and it 's just as labels to feel but on some of the project area literature early like especially in space would you travel a lot to open and especially when talking to Alexa and up sure you never miss an opportunity and I guess the tear roll as counselors and cuz that mean odd to me you asked us to help you so this is where we can help because we are around the country it those of us that you know you know happen about am involved in business we 'd be more than happy to go and see the right people if it helps you know as an opportunity anywhere I mean we 'd be happy to go and see people i like to wear but that 's how you get done in the small time because now you have connections that we don 't have and we 're really asking you then what Dzeko so Amelia please help us you know people that we die yams out like a Rupert is happy to an ex named the ex-commissioner to India has a holiday home just all in cash available but overall he now looks for in fact not we just pick up the phone and talk to it moves reform affairs and trade and all of us because he looks good and whether it should be with a train goes off that 's your call to make me believe we didn 't even thank you up we 're very mindful of that yes girls cousins you counseled happy I was I 've spoken to threats tonight about this before because before i voted council I was doing that I was down to international friends not knowing what I was doing and if I want for your count to 10 the count to Jesus effect one so just throw it first yeah you to condemn you just wrote it for its them do that yeah which I have done a couple of times here sorry to probably too many times so it doesn 't matter but something wrong email later on Sunday night yeah it was an awesome we have those offering the right we have to do this if you want to walls up what you haven 't offered for one watch other advantages it isn 't cheap rates or none she probably made 13 one knows it right of it we want to do this sort of marking I mean go a story right so why we 've launched on it we look at and this is tied up with some sort of natural we do we do do that when some of the initiatives that it were very clear before when we 've got something specific we will target and a half a dozen or a dozen potential parties that could be interesting we know they 're there in that game still I just had to say thank you to DG um sorry that very much and your district focused end to learn and geeky no really included in or you don 't and I think that really shows how open you are to the Holy Land thank you very much yeah Justin Dorset on behalf of the council thank you realize they Greg and Jeff and penny yeah your thymus volunteer you know volunteers and you know to have a great diverse

without its struggles with the an understatement and for those of you that don 't know Vanessa and myself both broke our knees during the winter season mine definitely was not around scheme but that put immense pressure on both the board at that stage I was the chair and also DJ LT so I would like to publicly acknowledge the fact that the team did an amazing job during period that Vanessa was actually out of action she was able to work from the isight office and able to actually climb the stairs and so that was a major problem in actually pulling the team together just on a achieved so as I say without its challenges and also during that period we had the resignation of both cdma end and david wilkes from the board and pleased to say that in the last three or four weeks we have appointed two very capable people whom i 'm sure you have all had the pleasure of meeting so sullivan and neil guest row so the board 's focus for the last six months has been very very strategic as we mentioned in the previous reports we were focusing on moving forward not looking back and so we have had some very good wenzhou link and I 'm sure that Vanessa 's presentation today will attest to that so I 'll pass you over to Vanessa Freeman manager of D journal t thanks Cathy a nolo would like to acknowledge or say that I 'm support of my team and board over that time we 're and we had some challenges in front of us but you we have had some great results just especially in a recent summer campaign anecdotally the whole industry certainly feeling like we 're calling three years so and we recently we 've had a workshop with all of you around the statement of intent and so taking a lot of the feedback on boards there 's no colored pictures in these it 's all black and white fix this presentation is happy and I 'm trying to keep and no technical talk or ignore it can have either it thumbs up to say so and the first slide is actually just covering what we did and they am tourism sort of landscape workshop and I just wanted to raise again the value of tourism to this region in the fixer and chosen as with four hundred million dollars annually to this region 120 million an international visitor expenditure in 280 and domestic we add contribute with thirty three percent and contribution to toples GDP and still the biggest employer of FTE employing three and a half thousand and full-time employees and tourism so as you can see tourism itself and well part of I guess the broader economic development landscape is certainly contributes and let 's sheer to chouteau for so all I wanted performance objectives and give you an overview of the last six months the highlights under each one of those and performance areas or performance objectives so I 'm building a stronger tourism economy features is one of their umbrellas and our plan and overall strategy with an annual target of 950,000 bead nights so the six month the result and to date we 're tracking at 454 and 876 so I 'm thousand sorry and that compared year-on-year_``_275.92 we 're sitting just over 20,000 big nights ahead of the same time the year prior so we 're certainly on track to achieve and that goal and bearing in mind toe that these steps or the current through six-month block as absent of our summer months so this is probably the lowest it and the next six months and includes genuine Phoebe which are high amounts accommodation stats and not reflective of holiday homes or be in bees and actually was mentioned last time that he 's was party to some research it was done at the national level where they estimate that we 're probably missing another half a million so you know quite quite significant but rkp eyewear performance objective is around commercial accommodation so and the next performance objective as I many targets with our website traffic so we have average visits per month and the target when you target was 30,000 per month over averaged over so a six-month results so over two over the first six months we 're tracking it over 43,000 visits in a month so again a lot of our marketing activity that 's pointing back to great lake toba calm as ensuring that we were keeping on track with their eerie actually no smashing that target so it 's a really positive so next performance objective is our commitment to stakeholder engagement and participation now and this was an unbelievable result I think for the region so one of our stakeholders as tourism New Zealand there are national tourism organization and we as the regional tourism organization in a very strong partnership with them there 's a lot of touching that goes on and and often and a pay our space in with media you know a lot of activities got to one big hit like last year so the virtually USA and 2004 's series and they filmed an episode here and taupe or so we accommodated all of the media and all of a thing of rosy honest i don 't know all of you know the show but and was done in this region and the only location was the central north island and so that episode aired on TV and the u.s. on the tenth of you viewing and it into 7.8 million people and the US so the days following there are the launch of their episode we had an increase of us a traffic to a website of five hundred and fifty percent and the results don 't actually stopped via aber so that was the first viewing and they 'll continue to run the reruns but we also continue to get media follow-up from it as well stories written around it and both nationally in internationally so as far as our participation in partnership goes that was a great result for the region as well and the food performance objective as being fiscally responsible in kind of kpi 's had tagged to our I sites for that so um just to give you an indication through the SOI we had an annualized income target of four hundred and four thousand in a six-month result as 242,000 so again we 're on track to achieve that and I think just to give you some context around us as well I sites have not been without their struggles giving money across the counter and the competition is with online purchasing I think you know nationwide globally you know people that are stealing and or seeing you know so much picture saying going online hints you know like our continued investment with great lake toba calm so our sites though are a big part of like week what we offer to our visitors and the quality experience to our visitors I mean we have I recorder million people come through toe poor eyesight alone and you know we were those quarter of a million people go that visit our town if they didn 't have at front shopfront to come to so they do an amazing job they we 've focused on cost efficiencies and they are you know not expensive for any retail environment has its costs and I 'm both staffing the actual center itself running a business does cost money but they are doing you know really well in again an indication todo me and Phoebe airy and their overall sales were up twenty two percent and they the best febuary since 2008 so again you know we haven 't_''_577.71 we have had our challenges that when you look at actually achieving our objectives we 're actually hitting the mark on a number of levels in the last six months and in the last came on board we did reset our strategy so we continuing to deliver it and really harness nature 's ultimate playground as our buyer line it 's worked really well on both in the domestic and international space so you know we 're continuing to use that platform and to all of our marketing and index including the online space and I just wanted to not that I wanted to dive into deep detail around the digital space because I know know like everyone 's eyes just glaze over however we need to acknowledge the fact that you know visitors sixty percent of visitors and to this town to this region and or whether by like you product online or not they 're doing research online so Aaron V smell great lake toba calm is really really significant so what we 've done with the recent project of the redevelopment of the website as we 've opened our arms and included like all of the agencies that sit in the hub and this project so our retail sector our events team or events full stop calendar everything economic development plus the destination marketing or is happening on this one lending environment and so I just want to be really clear about while the investment the actual dollars spending come out of DJ ot 's budget we are investing for the wider region it so that great like toefl dot-com land and environment as for the wider region and anyone who wants to visit and vist stay return so I mean I 'm sure you all know people that have come and have a lot of like immigrants from other regions coming in so yeah it 's while it may seem like a large investment I can say their destination marketing organizations around the world are spending up to eighty percent of their overall marketing budget and the online space so that 's just to give you some black you know context of like why we 're putting such an emphasis in their area I get the last that I wanted to talk about was I attended they tourism 2025 national framework launched yesterday in Auckland so all of the CEOs from our national bodies to as New Zealand which eyes of Industry Association the airports nationwide albergo kind of like operators were present in be so I you know the ministry of business and innovation do love our steps you know the end there I guess myntra was a lot around alignment well everybody has different ideas about how money should be spent you know Martin 's nians big kind of play was when our thinking is aligned you know there 's so much more power and that and then a and I guess you know just pushed it out was there if we do align our thinking and we all set together we 're going to achieve a hell of a lot more then if we do set instead of silos so I guess that really as the presentation I wanted to focus on black and white facts and results that we 've had impact on and but i 'll just ask kathy took to close up ok well it was an interesting with the store ISM framework in tourism new zealand is acknowledged as being the marketing arm for new zealand but we will know particularly from local government that it is is the local governments infrastructure and the businesses with when within those communities that actually are the tourism industry so it is very important I think that we recognize that although there has been this incredible investment made by tourism museum for international marketing domestic marking cannot be forgotten and it as our local communities that really need to be focused and pushing that forward so again I would just like to acknowledge on behalf of DG and the I guess as I say the support but the actual feedback that we are getting from counselors it 's fantastic to actually have some really robust engagement and we welcome that we are fully aware that we are responsible for ratepayers money and I as a ratepayer equally consumed for a number of issues so it is actually really great to have finally have some engagement from a council that really is concerned about the future of tourism and their region so I 've just like to say thank you thanks Lisa questions or queries for the counselors yeah she so i forgot to say i just type it my report in spain weeds because that 's covered a lot of stuff that with workshop end like you know like that drilling down into the details side one you mentioned about the eyesight 's not thinking isn 't nearly but in a community safer why else we may need eyesight not realistic but they lose money there in private secret i wouldnt realm that and ultimately so i should have given what 's wimbledon libraries with susie this on this piece from idea that influence well about it maybe we should we go finish your ice ice back to Council and our marketing arms do with us yes be the marginal machine by the euro and more stringent and that will separate turret operators are we feeling a little bit unloved by Mac conclusion and it 's on d I saw an effect for you to all the amount of material through the everyone no connection or disconnection people just keep your take on that but all over them economics colic then give me the wrong for our 8am but there are ways builders blt edited by sight or the major expenses and other operating expenses relates solely to DPRK oh god this thing injuries to save your thoughts on there I guess I 'm little bear drool they can or they 're not I think one of the really important things again and sounds like I 'm hobbling on the same horse but and as their integration to online because it 's how visitors are purchasing the product in our region that is really really important relationships result and we want a better result in more visitors to the region so how the I sites are managed and we 're they are positioned ultimately that is up to all of yours as a governing body and a management level I will manage whatever is required but we really do need to I think remember that the integration how people purchase as what our eyesight sweet present and so you know whether they 're in or out that integration to online has gotta happen MX we were actually skipping forward or really so you know what we offer on the eyesight and what we have available online need to like integrate and you know that 's where I think there needs to be a lot of energy focused to be free of five days say they were not course introduces you never see you remember for you I think again you know their models nationwide toe solar and some artios healthier eyesight some don 't and freeing up these opportunities for both so and if we continue to have the I sites and the destination marketing portfolio the again back to alignment of thinking and you know it would be a lot easier to sort of make the attraction quicker and again you 're the governing body if you believe in livery switched remove evidence to you know demonstrate that the I sites are well operate better with own counsel then you know of that 's probably a long-term plan issue so model fitness model create whole and under for us moving to all about two days for what who is responsible those crew members who they answer to so we are to sheer rock machine oil in a look so great in here doing I cycle but well c thought she was just not possible just take up a business which means that i start with lisa great october website I think we write down into I 'm kind of management stuff here and I think that you know it 's a real operational thing in heaven sort of conversations around how that all work altima tlie up here back to their you know how visitors buy stuff on top or that would be where i would lose sight of the fact that really I sites irrespective of whether their visitor centers where I sites are actually a marketing arm of DG OT and as we 've discussed they are the shop front for the visitor Castle body 2 i 'll just make a comment to call you mrs. Freeman my baby you mentioned there and some of the states that you 've got up they don 't show follow their homes that would be applicable like a vault Austria he told I here and it 's applicable other way as well okay can you tell us what the total budget you receive from right pair in industry and what percentage of X actually goes on Direct Marketing IE after overheads in salaries etc there 's a business plan put together every year and we spend between 850 to 860,000 depends on you know i mean this is about that I 850,000 on that on marketing itself and bit as presence of info convention work trade work international domestic and plus all of the stuff that we don 't like that the overall regional compliance stuff as fifty percent of what you receive it 's been hundred mcatee oh it 's interesting though remember we have to operate to I fights above a lot of there is goes towards operating the eyesight and yeah so managing to businesses plus the marketing and running a team as well actually and for me we 've just had the price waterhouse report which we 've all been through and when we looked at the back of that and it 's it 's some of the alternatives there that we had in regards of the way we do things I think I had a bit of a disagreement with mr. Samuel in regards of when we look to that it really was talking about outsourcing now I 've spoken to you about the website if I was an operator initiatives going to cost me three hundred dollars to be on that website I know text by a rat pay money I would sign the check but if I didn 't get a result you wouldn 't get my check next year I 've also raised that same issue in the annual I said very clearly and I still stand by that if you 're going to advertise a wedding site or a wedding venue you should be doing it not the right pace so I just like a good feedback on they thinking sure I 'm and that is the moment that we wrote in towards exactly what we 're talking about so again like I 've seeds quite like tofu home as a regional investment lets you know you know the online environment for the region and and like you 've spoken about john f there are advertisers that are not giving a return on investment and they have the option to pull out but we certainly like working towards like that model but also being representation for the whole region not just the visitors so so you worship when we do our deliberations on the annual plane if we decided to take x off your budget you wouldn 't worry about that because you go to go out to the mark nothing I I 'd like to answer that I mean I think one of the things that we we did discuss this during the course of the SOI discussion how each of the individual businesses and we have some large ones and large chains here in Talpiot both accommodate errs and activity operators who are who are contributing greatly to the marketing of this destination and I think if you you dilute there 's always somewhere else that money can be spent and I think that 's what the board has identified caster body is that we we do not necessarily agree with some of that and you 've highlighted weddings there 's a classic example I feel and on behalf of the board that you know there is something that potentially individual businesses should be doing and that should not be labeled as as something that DG OT should be taking part in the one thing that I would like to acknowledge those and thank you John for like raising there and being honest about and that it has set as a white elephant like in the room and but what I will say though tOA 's and a game yesterday you know our heads at a hammering tourism and the last three or four years this is the time where people were to be brave and continue to invest because I will pay big dividends will seem that bounce back and you know the international market plus we 've had some really good results in domestic so I just like to leave you with it because Cathy 's correct you know you can pick up money and rob Peter to pay Paul but you know you sore the step that went up on the screen at the beginning of the presentation tourism as with four hundred million dollars to this region and I just like to leave you with it thanks thanks for this and just like to do what 's your words and thank you on behalf of the council for all the good work you do you know the numbers are tracking up and that 's a good sign obviously nationwide it 's trekking up as well so it just really to be on a game to to make sure that continues so thank you and thank you caffeine because I know you 're on the cheese roll today so thank you we have a _"

electricity suppliers I think it would be fair to say i can listen but i won 't float on your are your resolution thank you ok ok Neil back EMF avec has everyone got the handouts that was tabled on your discs you never ate the new user sorry the new I should say cool right okay so free background we currently on the final year of a three-year contract with trust our trust power for the supply of our electricity for the district that 's broken down into three elements it 's what 's called known time of use some sites time of view sites in street lighting so there 's three areas I 'm given the complex nature of the electricity market in how different companies price we 've used for the second time company called energy select who has basically a 25 seed market share and this type of work in New Zealand to information coming back and to provide a recommendation to us so Dennis and Ivan and discussions within throughout this process and the way that the consultancy company works in terms of working with the all the major players is they very much work on a best foot forward approach so the parties are under no illusion that the best offers must people forward to us and coming out of that is a recommendation we buy we split the contract based on the offers that have come back between contact energy for the tone of your sites and trust power for the non time of use and street lighting so that is the recommendation that has been put forward in the items and it 's a 33 year contract do you worship one of the terminology sends the warden regards and what time of use sites in on time a few stones James Street baking yes Tommy use basically runs off a metering process where they monitor the basically the hourly consumption that goes on there it 's the greatest examination but it 's me to do in beaten to death purposes or anything like that does that pose like you haven 't_''_181.12 to sort of how do they get paid it 's probably a slightly increased challenge administratively but for to get the best overall outcome for the community we believe that this is the best deal if this energy selected select or ever but whatever they call that they go to every pair continued till norge a day when they put the tender to every Power Company eight of the nine that are in the market submitter tenders yeah what 's been the previous price paid for this we 've got really saving about a hundred thousand per annum coming out of this concrete its new contractors I just have a question on and the second one with trust power on a non time-of-use site that says for the three years at an estimate estimated some of and we can someone explain why it 's an estimated some yet because it 's a good question but the answer is because I don 't know how much people are going to turn their light switches on an air conditioner on is fixed the volume is viewable thank you okay you have a quiz on I 'm simply happy a bit suggested resolution the two companies they threw put a lot into this district as well as a vessel well contact ng obviously got a lot of employees here a lot of activities here and also trust pay out who we do you know the volunteers of the

Obara and pairing here they 're feelin it 's an interesting one that um it 's just it was an X and O direct which probably should have been um done away with it and the 2002 amendments but it hasn 't been so that is really out of date so it 's probably something that needs to be tired out that hasn 't been through you your worship referred 1111 will exceed secret commissions Act of nineteen ten and the implication of assisting of us getting rewards and gifts and we do corporate elites tickets come into that equation yes mr. LeWitt I resisted food I just thirsty on me empowering act what a back when it was passed in nineteen seventy you couldn 't set up a visitor center another palace it up the center 's so special education to do it yes should have fallen off when you got that power andrew has no basis for that but it 's still there the Civil commissions act has no relationship to gifts or anything to do with that what secret commissions act is about is if you 're involved in a commercial transaction can take a backhander we can breathe out develop so it 's it doesn 't relate at all to corporate gifts somebody taking a commission for doing the council during a commercial deals okay so effectively then the three members from except accepting gifts or rewards is irrelevant its gifts or rewards relating to giving giving work thanks Rob in the other Cruiser fish now I 'll net well good good i suggested resolution the or amended resolution and obviously that 's a common sense only f change the names don 't have a mover please machi secular by castle diamonds all those in favor please say aye against Derek think eat okay thanks I owe me a panic story you again hunter yep and nothing more to add except the young resolution should read code of conduct 2014 rather than 2018 okay we 've got any changes or freeze on this one to you wish it through just a quick query it 's good to see that the appendix read it was on the back of the old kind of contact me I 'm cooler than that blank document I also completing the to your worship family the old code of conduct was extremely easy to follow if you are discussing Israel in this meeting because for instance in the document at the moment 32 you didn 't 's not I 'm just running with it what assistance through the debates or using of this document we can refer to those specific by number rather have you say the third paragraph down or the fourth paragraph up is the other as the old document wasn 't fake numbered see just the old one deliver and sign this done the last rhenium yeah so you circulate again around to the joint in some unique response appears more awesome try to come back move for baby becomes Australian cigarette please get for hobby and key who those in favor please say aye alright as against scary item number fourteen fifteen tweeting needs a player and consultation two sisters drafting of commemorative furniture huntington Barrow guidelines going on a year maybe oceans and uses resolution mother Debbie tax is that it is the resolution now we have a second to place Thank You casa willemsen all those in favor please say aye I against ok I don 't on the 14 fish water yeah this is Ben this is Richard for each respective one yes unfortunately and this was circulated in on the December gender time unfortunately so um that 's why we follow the process of circulating it by email 16 comments shouting that looks good any questions or theories of Hillary on this one driver mover for that place by but just couple of queries yeah I brought you up say me when did you actually get this document from local government easier because I think they 're being a little bit unfair on our staff under pressure to get this out and likely it was at a later date there sure was is that LG in Z actually received an extension of time from a from the ministry of environment so we were short a time frame than what local government New Zealanders so they recirculated years and I got it two days before I recirculated it to you and that it was a draft at that point there were minimal changes there are only a significant change to the submission was the conclusion which I have got and copies of here if you would like me to circulate those I read this document quite extensively and I in this regard I think protective a second paragraph thumbs up till she 's quite well in this particular later and I also would like to refer to 14 bar 27 where it states exceptions to national bottom lines which gives us a little bit more room for discussion later in the day all right suggested resolution let 's speak to this admission fee by Counsell hit bling seconded by Councillor cousins always in favor please say aye it 's carried I from _"

    "text": "by removing please mi casa Jones seconded by Councillor body all those in favor please say aye I in scary item number six hello Dennis you doing new I Mendez I am a date no I wish you all the best of luck today okay gender many others in the first area wide on portland road of plated is written there was any questions or capsules for my place kessler cousins through to you you worship or just a bit consume that the engineered is mr. was two hundred and two thousand and the prices with 250 to 400 its twenty percent at a minimum out in jerz engineer 's estimate is based on looking at what we have received typically in the past they exactly that an engineer 's estimate what you see with the actual process of what people are prepared to do the work for sometimes there is the difference i would say there 's been a guesstimate not the least of it as it sweeps it is huge cuba think so in the bigger than in the past which it could exhibit who 's the engineer is our person that 's on employee and as i said that the engineer 's estimate is based on looking at a range of costumes that have been received over the past 12 months for similar types of jobs in making an assessment of where the market might or might not go i can be slightly healthier we have had a number of contract previously that in under the estimate engineers budget and I suppose that 's where dennis is coming from I would take most food I think one of the things i would add it now is that we have had a look run for quite some time now remember reviews when we 've consistently had thunder was returned below engineer 's estimate it 's this is symptom that will need to keep an eye on moving forward that if we find that our founders coming over engineer 's estimate it 's a reflection that the market is picking up it 's a reflection that people don 't necessarily need the work quite as much as they have needed the work so i would say the old risk of receiving a number of tenders upwards of the assessment rather than at or below yes for heavy i know that um Zane and I versus and the pass cuz work with tenders and options obviously do you ask if if there is a movement in it in their prices all of them no we don 't in this particular instance we 've got seven contractors that of course that 's a reasonably sick significant number for a tender they have put on competitive process even though you wouldn 't say that our your engineers price is considerably lower and would anyone look at their price I that some bets grounds to me for asking once again the engineer 's estimate as an engineer 's assessment it 's not a business decision to decide what it costs to build the job counselor cousins just on that can we ask what the next two tenders were up on 352 are you up give it information there or not no not if they will age yeah just one thing that we have done in the past is with listed the tenderers in best practicing yeah that commercial silver situation like this you will put the lowest and the spread but if you want to put the second lowest and third lowest would disclose certain commercial information to those losing tendrils and we 're not able to do that no I suppose you get into a situation do I even he go back you 've got if you go back to when you go get back to mold it wouldn 't be quite a major other thing I think I think if you only had to something like that your way out and I think possibly from where she is going back to seven seven companies we use it is to go back to PA Norris it 's a commercial world and i think that i think it 's just good business practice to go back to everyone and just say you 're out from our estimations would you like to rethink your tender even if you save twenty thousand dollars for greeting only its good governance absolutely cycling I was just going to make a comer if councillors really needed that information it 's that 's that 's how I see it anyway and I think it 's better to be in the open and accept the contract as it is yeah and to possibly do it in confidentiality with that public yes sir Jonathan I 'm just a point to make we are looking at redraft looking at a new draft of our procurement policy are we not would potentially the questions raised by Councillor come in Harvey be able to be discussed in it review or as in not like where you see that process going the purse of that policy was discussed earlier another doctor proceeding toward risk that the detail around her team does handle would be powered from out of the procurement procedures are procurement yes so I guess what I 'm asking is would we have an opportunity as part of the procedural part of that to look at these points raised by these two counselors in that discussion mr. Fox 3 mr. chair putting the first move to do is get this policy the draft or soft water use on to make sure where they get the first tip I mean once you 've done well I think the team of us with them counsel to be looking at those guidelines and I 'm clear double available to go it 's possibly a time to do that method that we are going to Castle ahadees efficient and we wish to run this through the one human right understood okay just come in here can I just comment that the engineer 's estimate was not what is in the budget my first concern is that we have sufficient in the budget to cover what the tender prices so i just played that there was a difference in each case between an engineer 's estimate than what we 've actually budgeted there now and your plans think you missed me here counsel John disappointed at once before our budget has an ace isn 't a target we need to reach we can save money then we need to look at it Rick and we are by no means suggesting that you know you are not good at what you do but we also have skills to bring maybe we can add some value in that way and you know if we can let 's what we 're here for you worship okay yeah I 'd by person can take on it because the event you go 66 and tenders never once have the expertise and running commercially commercial business I don 't think we should be involved and trying to negotiate when battle them pissed me off in your spell say the first off the best offer because I it 's not something that you likely thank you can so John you wish I just have one other question for alpha mr. Louis which relates to budgets because we 're starting the countdown to the end of the financial year obviously and funding for this and your arm pay for season is sufficient funding and the council councils area-wide treatment budget are you expecting any other calls on that budget for the end of the finance for you I 'm just wondering if there any other significant projects so we 're not oh ok thank you thought is a suggested resolution the other we did I just management plan September 2004 till it have been updated this is specific to that particular Road or as a journal and the second part of the question is is this particular job mr. Lewis of severe agency or candy my name 's be used for a part of our the manor roads in the field every year or is it completely separate budget to answers to the question though the corridor management plan for building road hasn 't been updated and it only refers to go control there is a number of other management plans for other roads like the road and what my third and the second question around funding and that we do before we go down the path of an era where this look at what it would cost to and fix up we love them deteriorated pavement we 're looking for this cost whole of life option and then work results and we reward then we 're going to go down that path thank you we 're following on for that and I think it 's quite important that we have a little bit more debate because I believe that the promise that they put through I think Seth put in the bank your worship Dennis the terminology air wide treatment you 're talking about the total resale of the road and not just white we 're talking about total overall of the road with about a hundred millimeters of of nice course and then selling it okay my name is Meghan for that number of complaints about disease you 've brought on what further than throw in the pasture fennec okay I 'd but they made the suggested resolution you are shown a keith is rescinded by canceling signature by Councillor jolons all those in favor please say island like final take was only one asking everything is react all right there has been limited regarding the future policy important to let say that so all those in favor please say aye vinced carried item number 17 assists illimité excellence you worship them there is a and an amended attenuation been tabled and the changes in the resolution but the one of the counselors hope it so that the change as in the suggested resolution point three four five maybe an exit row to a total value up so there 's been some words are made at the increase I bet amount and this contract is our tomb service contract I 'm typically tomb service contracts are for a reasonable period of time to enable the contractor to realize the benefits and the capital expenses required to sit up for such a country and fulton hogan have had the contract for three years and they are operating very well and meeting all the performance targets and far being part of them the way they deal with and the same and my father saw the river and most will to meet with are looking for other opportunities or modern eras cost council d questions and queries on that counselor jolons just a query this one is for the network 's only correct who looks after the actual maintenance of the wastewater plant hit their own stuff aaron staff to that group and am I just interested to know your view on how successful it 's been to combine those different networks under one supplier you found have been operated under one contract for a long time since since the league 's been contracted oil and this is going both probably team in 15 years so the way I read it was relatively racing writer this culture will contract for overall income before you worship I just under options one the resolutions this is not the snow disadvantages I was a little bit concerned about it i 'm not saying we shouldn 't run with them in right there but to me a disadvantages that were not encouraging to fear for good practice I 'm not having a tinder and we 're not creating a rocket of receipt as a a competitive environment or we create an anchor pitiable environment if we didn 't see me the first one does have its advantages ahem being listed there was it just me i 'm not encouraging fear practice of tendering which underlies a we could be seen as not allowing for a competitive environment for for a service contract of this nature short duration contracts are financially not viable for concreteness because there 's a reason be significant sort of got a balance between having a reasonable period of time over which the contractor can work mokuba 's costs and screwed us get across the intellectual property right with this contract we 've seen well they 've set it up so that there 's a seamless electronic transaction between council service request system that automatically generates a request for the staff to go out and do the route now those sort of stuff comes at a cost so if you compress the contract period up to a two or three contract in it financially it 's just not viable to take it on i hear you i just feel my consumer be that people would accuse us just does she have a contract year renewing it and saying if they wanted to continue for nearly opportunity that I see is a disadvantage action I think should be via fostering just another cynical as the one-liner in the it 's a one liner in their same I don 't_''_947.79 so which is then effect I can see where the illegal thing I 've got this contract for life property on yeah but you and obviously keep an eye on that anyway yourself but damn i can see can you worship and this you know because this is really quite a big increase in from the three thousand up to 5,000 sorry million are you i am really comfortable with with what they are actually collagen because it is a really big income from from last year d to take us three to the feet average monthly cost of the contract for the three years weeks added about a hundred for the last release is about 105 k a month this and next 12 months is based on about a hundred and twelve k a month we 're currently running about 30,000 underway are predicted for the furthest rumors so I 'm totally confident that this is a roof realistic price okay you wish I also struggling with the figures which is not unusual if we look at that the second paragraph down its fate it was for a period of three years finish end or beginning the dune starting in July 114 2000 82 million 2.8 million to extend start with whether the business come in about the 956 thousand the 936 thousand what Kailen because the original tender schedule and did not have sufficient quarters quantities on it to a know where the three years to be completed so effectively in that three-year period another nine hundred thousand was introduced the 3d appeared would result in the street you know left the 3.8 million which we accept 105 Calvin format so much you they were invented so could understand it just the second last paragraph down you state to either plain 14 during summer being in your mind you must have been suggested to us that we may clean to go to tender a little bit sympathy with cousins regards of appearance is that within the amount of May that we have to go to tender on is it being transparent but not going to end it the contractor provide extinction lets us really contract thus the potential for two further extensions of language this is what we are seeking is an extinction I felt like we 're they bring each which of through you and we 're at least one more year potentially a question then is why would the document state to either plan for tendering if council decides not to accept the real labor that we would need to attend it so we effectively we 're not bound to roll over this creator so through you your worship we 've done is what because this is obviously I think it 's quite an unimportant part of councils operation and what lead time would you require to actually pretender this this whole work because what you 're saying is this takes us from 2015 financial year 3 20 2016 14 15 clicks in in June this is discreet but texas until june 15 correct what sort of time do you think you would require like sake of argument if the council didn 't approve the final year of this contract we would be when bringing something to council probable in december of this year and so december 2014 and to get some indication of what council would desire for that final year as well so I thought it might be so to help me at your we pass this loose on the concrete answers but we don 't have to pass it we can say we want to go to tender now and do we have to pay the extra the mountain penalty surely in a contract through you your worship that you either all party can back out through Sophie clé what I 'm trying to get down through if someone 's to move that we actually go to tend to forget to carry out this activity there 's nothing to stop doing it correct but I 've is the time that it takes you to arrange the new contract that 's concerning me it would be difficult and also wouldn 't be recommending quite strongly that that council looked all over this contract as I said earlier the contractor is performing these meeting owners performance targets and he 's doing a particularly good job do we have to pay the increased cost you are not paying increase costs what what they contract prices based on is that an assessment of the quantities that are likely to be used over the next 12 months based loss is lunacy to we did another process we are saying that you will get a cheaper person fifth I would suggest that given the current market with the bill going home and cross streets with a lottery an open that 's highly possible that you will find it after poem here I 'll move the suggested resolution your worship for a further one-year publish contract usually like a can item mmit that have a very definite amendment to them it 's a second door anywhere before I am okay does he see them John slugging but I can 't see the bucket salutes and council body oh the resolution is to remove stays the same I wanted to be a member to read am from one July 15 we go to tender effectively that gives us period of time I tagging on regards to Lucia to regard to what else is happening around the country but I 'm here to try and give good governance and I feel uneasy if we go into just money out without going through due process it 's my yep my amendment issue yeah can vote on before you go and vote on the first resolution if that 's what you want to do it doesn 't have to be a amendment however what I would caution you at this point in time is to consider the engineer 's advice either in december or in 12 months time as to what the state for market actually is because as Genesis just alluded to is that if we if we 're in a really busy engineering market at that particular time and and you do have the ability for a further rollover within this contract you could end up getting a far cheaper price by role in the contract over by a further and you need to take advice closer to that time as to what the market conditions are i would suggest you worship um in essence I support what Rob Williams are saying I think it makes good sense to take Dennis a mr. Lewis 's advice in this instance but make a diary note that we reassessed based on mr. Lewis 's recommendations in December I hear what you 're saying and wish me I 've move the suggested resolution as it is on the agenda item and I think we 've got a 2nd earth yet signal canceled limited is the amendment going to be put as a second resolution for because I 'm uncomfortable with that being part of this resolution which neighbors can hear is such you need to deal with the you mean the first journey to ask tell me what is the minith yep risen okay okay Castle body is suggested amendment is he a second opinion so go back to the original resolution so moved as both the original resolution your wishes as it is I came been singing if I cancel Williamson all those in favor please say aye hi those against I carried and like that record it you can somebody who I _"

brief erection what happened did they all operate is the aroma 202 which was the one who had aquarium well 100 heroes as pure period beaches I 'm editor was on lead installation that Lake Tahoe 's

guaran-- to julia and the construction and then you make a new injury and what is really kicking with others so just further than directly on as the licensee you signed the contract agreement yes okay okay what any other cap passion on these men tried to murder peaceful isn 't it smooth like cancer Collins signaled by counsel Williamson all those in favor please say aye thank you item number for this is the receipt of the minutes to end etomidate Oh community board and also the fences dogs and reserves the points of clarification or chicks on net is that this too is a suggested a mesma Stuart Arts Council strip and just in the statistics resolution on page four by four we have a recommendation to Council and I would not get adopted as well one is say this party that 's a new patio you 're suggesting levels of the second will you be adopted through the cheer that 's unbudgeted expenditure which council have degree to which are what you think decade to be right in time for access it 's number five for battle yes it 's usually you want to clear for this yes it 's it 's to create something that was done in we were under the County Council and they put the staircase in at should appear in Council and part of it is was put on a private property it hasn 't sort of been an issue that there 's new owners on the property now and they you 'd like us to buy the land underneath it or remove and it is the only it 's an access way from capella up to the shop at I 'm worried and it 's well used and regularly used by everybody beard visitors me when I right during box and everything and the presentation reaction of Germany random things like that totally outweigh the cost of just of buying the land underneath so it 's really good put in ranch what cousins it wasn 't us wasn 't the county council was Talmud annoyed we 'd here as it fits limit we would tell you tell we were terminally County Council with the estate knob so it was only nineteen seventy to receive the members anyway she wasn 't not corrected that the demolition of this particular stay away would cost more than us purchasing the lien yes and then we would still be pressured to put anyone in which would cost to see more so this has been debated quite ably after you so thank you for that I 'm inside via counselor know about this dress version once clarification or more pages here Sam so we 've got a new part of the resolution you can move bikes and play strip so you can break applicants or ladies a private place iight i against Gary item number five okay thank you your worship and we 'll take the artemis road but I just want to highlight a couple of things that the summer by all accounts from the feedback that we 've been receiving through town has been very providing recently good feedback we 've had a number of events that have been well attended from the reggae concerts to the Waitangi Day concert to the summer concert and what go mobile major we 've had received we 've received very positive feedback about our events calendar journalist and appeared and we 've also received good feedback from the AC baths reopening and I 'm at the Swim School has become very busy again which is good to see because numbers did drop off significantly during refurbishment period and it was also very heartening from my perspective to see a project that 's been on the cards for quite some time into Tony come to fruition with the album of the skate park down there and I feel we 've taken a great step forward in terms of identifying some young community leaders in that part of the world which is which bodes well for the future and that 's a real highlight from my perspective and oh man it 's been much show business as usual doin some apparent no but I 'm happy for myself for staff they were into it at all and we 're going to be accessing appliances now we 'll just leave you discuss any open it usually yeah worship in regards of the media releases I 've had heaps to two queries in regards of the fact that we have just been 48,000 from the by-election I 'm wonder if we could have a press release actually stating that it spiked certain statutes that we have to follow and therefore the clarifies the issue for for the right place has to be done by law not because if they 're wish anybody here I would also support that your worship hmm I 've had quite a few comment regarding my I election and what it 's costing and I do think that we need to to have some better communication on yeah why we have to do it this way please agree with it so just keep bein me and the audience here today so he set some idea taken note of that give few quick so I am yeah it 's my lord my statue so it works and that could cruise on the CEOs report for you to go through and casa da man sissippi I I have just a couple of questions you worship mr. Williams but I 'm wondering if it 's just easier to go through it without laboring it just to go through the sections with it and the financial one first um first of all well thank you for putting an extra column from our last meeting the year in forecast I find that useful thank you um I just had a couple of quick questions and other expenses we have an item it says other items which is taken quite a jump from last report was standing at about 24,000 I think an hour up to 202 what was what was that oh sorry I 'm page 5 of 9 sorry um the bottom of the local and 0 it 's got other items with an s terrex um they 're all to do with the weather tightness because we were only 24 k last time we did this app linear was gonna dance for them examined it is on and this ecchi a for 525 this foursome resume yep okay so I guess we 'll they 're showing us at the the positive variance has increased so all the saving has in the forecast know what about the actual spend to budget has been less yeah you have to I think I words to explain that sure no it 's just that was a reasonably large variation yep yeah yeah I don 't have the actual are there 's thousands of lines of transactions that make that arm so um but yeah I Yogi 's when I look at that I go I go let 's actually tracking quite well you wish loading highlighted it 's got 120,000 k do we not approve monies and regardless to settle the claim which was well an access the internet to them is um through the chair I guess we are still in negotiations with the lawyers acting for leaf owners those through the times there are still some issues with negotiating in respect of other parties and we are hopeful that for the March council meetings we can bring forward a proposed settlement was well 59 to item G in regards to risk pool membership I was under the impression that we didn 't have insurance but finished in 09 which was that when risk all was well on that but in fact we pay me a membership fees in thirteen fourteen thirteen fourteen year they were reasonable that cards sorry mr. chair risk pool is not not wound up and we 're still a member of risk pool in terms of public liability insurance etc and fishel indemnity insurance so it 's not going up is just a long don 't you effectively a membership fees to belong to an organization but doesn 't give us any insurance rights in regards of leaky homes that 's correct keep tellin ya gots the cousinship just on page 512 drag you out of the little river just in a bomb never says economic development this is DT LT with paper boarding ripped renewal and convince management small mounts fifteen thousand dollars each back does that show up in DG lt 's performance a part of your budget or has a little bit work regards to what only tackle the trailer measurement for ambulance I don 't understand mundial so this is a bottom of 512 gets economic development so I remember that the the group of activities which will respect to toe to the fish fun or be the DD ltd eyesight so if I 'm wrong meal but we still we still own the building yep so that 's why else will be sitting on our books and coming through here and in the second one of the guards to events ventral met Sarah beans team so I think we 've had five nine thousand dollars which has been leaving stroller in the trial of India which was the last nei ethical if you have to sit so these are basically added costs onto those two ce ce o-- 's really painful to events pi over hub video t so these are and expenses which won 't show up in nearby diseases either for us as well so they added costs to what you already give them and to in terms of events it 's my budget because the events stir for my employees are to make sure that we 've got like-minded individuals doing the work in the same place rather than having them in separate offices around and with respect to the the I sites where the landlord if you like the other tenant Catherine is your new worship Allison may be able to throw some modern miss just confirm on page or burn on is climbing and savings and lakes and rivers 25,000 is that relate to with your existing Eurasian infrastructure Illinois ensures subject to resource concerns so you can sinks it 's a timing issue so just call out about doing I 'm catch them actions is wrong way but there 's quite a lot says I 'll make some rivers there could be a number of things I 'm not quite sure detailer make some rivers item page 25 of the top my energy though I suspect that is the we 've got the monitoring budget and for protecting lake taupo so too with the monitoring and they contract budget they 're 58 your timing yeah thank you Richard very quickly on page five bar 11 Utley one to stoppage through the bus shelters I believe there 's been a problem with when it rains the water coming back under and bags or put on seats and 58 weed is it correct so oh just asking a question sorry about 20 preferred by 11 other proper transport bus infrastructure Sturridge six thousand dollars its bus shelter it 's about shelter her shell memories row row row your brush near us I need to ask I need to Anton ask the question it might be a silly question about a million I understood yeah just just to keep things a little rattled all over it is there any questions before 411 I I have some sorry let 's go back then so I started a tumblr mr. Williams just um he threw the cheer loss of disposal on SE it and that was just a new line that I hadn 't seen and last month 's report I just get a bit of background on what that is there and with it what what yeah what 's happening to you your generation cover the roads for that you I am just re and what we 've done is we 've moved it below the line and that it wasn 't as great last time so he was a loss on disposal nine year before and as a major contribution to that the AC bars as it is that is put down here at still a lot of it as demolition of IC bars in across the road so that 's just the asset that with demolish that is not the actual is it called demolish another building since the asset that we 've taken away to build a new one it 's the book value that was the flow was all red and so you have to write that out of the books how you do they obviously you write it down to zero because it doesn 't exist anymore yeah it 's right I was going to say it 's a financial treatment financial trader ugh that was yep that 's I just want to clarify because you threw me but he moved alive with both those assets of course now we 've got new buildings indeed that 's right up and through the chair reason we with traffic lower line is because it was under budget at assists and never going to mad and it was distorting the comparison is to actual budget and what we actually do budget for that will excrete that we do that because it obviously through my attention go through the paper thank you that 's good okay so we 're talking from 59 and if where you step through fries bar turn fiber tribe item yeah option whiskey I 'm just a query on the non-current decide to wear other shares and companies that seems to have gone up substantially I have an explanation on what we are up to doing me please the shares and companies down yeah so 27 you mean there too yes negative and so that some transactions we 've done moving from cash to equities was on the TL fun the key yeah yeah so it 's just a changing the mix of investments within the to your phone okay 11 5 12 5 13 x 14 and the end of that report at five shifting then i just pass a comment billet you will see i 'm on fire by 18 there they are year-to-date yield on the to your fund at 7.2 three percent is still substantially higher than what our cost of buying is as you 'll see on page five at 19 and the average cost per barn currently is six point three five percent sorry it was seven point seven point two three meteo and 6.35 is our cost of borrowing so that 's another reason why we take the arbitrage 592 we 're going to 520 the organization project and performance report 15 21 22 23 wishbone map 523 the creative community screams of these grants are they monies that come from budget or are they outside monies that we distribute prices and communities about side money from central government in the Royal treble and there 's also outside money 512 for 525 some cancers Rogers just dumb on the results for resource consents well done for the team there with a hundred percent that 's pretty impressive but concerned about the 36 of 565 building were witnesses but had been think the one was no other than when i 'm done to the target age of 22 c and their number the 565 is the all the moments they require wonderfulness the target is only to us be twenty percent of them per annum all the buildings every 500 one guy 's not 500 father 's this week 1000 the tweet proceed we should have come back to 52 for two questions once regards to make we assisted jar on the city no doubt we were paid for that the underbody resource consent that 's been appealed to the bio meter court you 've probably told us but what would that one be there after so very good that was in regards to the copper falls development but at the top of the whole way and it doesn 't look like it 's actually probably going to go to cordon so i was going to be an agreed to justin it 's really more of a minor issue we just saw some specific conditions not not be resource consent as a whole just on the picking up castle by shirley 're here paid under the scent of the there 's no unusual for different local authorities to assist each other in terms of peaks and troughs it 's how we were able to manage our resources across the region rather than sort of individually try to struggle with a lack of resources yep you okay 52 55 to 65 to 70 a quick question on errands and projects we 're talking about purchasing some generators for wealthier seen my understanding from reading that is there is something that will need to consider because of regional planning but it 's not in the long-term plan so where are we at with that particular piece of work is that our mr. fox fox sexy You mr. chair councillor currently we have received I think Andrew bones running that project for us and we have received changes please carry having evaluated respective two main generators there is also in the current approved capex budget monies for generator considerations for two honey I 'm a Latina and he 'll be bringing a full paper back to the next council meeting on net potentially marry we 're approaching the halfway mark will move into water and forth 28 but to a man living in to the capital expenditure projects for about 30 you wish a questionnaire egads are baked at contract for additional costs that time it 's been able for a while hasn 't it smack the teeth then act as well no to be resolved so that 's for Sierra penis sure a little of these come take a while to resolve their long 12 month retention programs and able to resolve those problems within that world with pretensions timeframe however from experience I 've known claims to take longer than that depending on whether you end up through a mediated settlement or court process if if they cannot reverse me to resolve so what could be that we 've come yeah there 's no risks but over the budget in what regard yeah that 's right yep that 's right okay okay five baths 31 32 33 34 because sure thank you very much happy bird that 's got three was just in regards to first resist results on the first line is a four year data required to demonstrate compliance regards water quality it 's Susan water supplies around the lake it stands spoke to Dennis Lewis about this quite a bit as it stands top I was the

logging data so we can be graded we 've got that make sense monitoring for all of our loss on boys and part of that is the water suburb district health board requires some 12 months full of data to

left we have got things in place who are underweight willing that 's why I asked question thank you ok 5 x 35 36 37 to green bears and fill rate very well I focus Olivier Schneider just wrote the blog of the pages as well as we did for the basketball months 2013-14 said that an action plan was developed for consideration by the board 's meeting in February and 2014 I didn 't see that or am I was presented for their you adopted resolution was close no no was that the action plan was it was just that we 're going to think I 'm take a review that the action plan is the review were doing so that was there was the actual 20 remember I had a whole list of different actions for each of the points coming over to lose review most of those head through the water with requirement so so it 's not made in m58 reaction time ahead of our nation pain pain acceptable is a motion but we haven 't got action plan to have no plan in terms of Windsor information going to come back all the others it is okay that 's right re action action planners and we 've already decided what we 're going to do and if I haven 't seen the stand what we mean it ok actually for performing what do you want about its owners legs come true to them done with the river 15 pages to bail it no furniture for Detroit 44 45 46 47 48 will be known solid waste 50 50 51 51 51 plus the five bipeds genus have actually been installed the area so did the whole and one get one of you the hole in one doesn 't what we 're doing is looking at a bigger package there because there are some erosion problems with that and we discussed that it off in the first workshop in your clean so there 's this quite a bit more work to be done some one extra can boost with the the owner of it yeah we have been in contact with our producers but though 5253 worship them through reserved and 153 plan changes where women that mediation we actually mr. Carroll 's on the back there okay Edgar on yes i 'm gail sorry you 'll remember that did it clear that ebriefed council won 't_``_1790.32 let you know two weeks ago and half navigate there 's like at the current time even a talking intense exchange tante jurors okay okay for 55 56 57 just a tie 50 60 207 well done yeah just in case I said little and further further 58 historians to stir stick clarification on the results and the economic development for business confidence when were those business confidence measures taken for the Talpiot district they set at twenty four percent whereas was there is that is that an old research Figaro 's ever this is the new one just take a bit of a step of this one and that comb what we ought to have Mia those ones don 't call you the business confidence surveys year so if this is the everyone will it improve the December 1 i 'd be quite understood tonight it 's the way you read their as tourism down compared to the national average so i think we need to look at those things if your current yeah that 's right my guess would be that those were figures from the full christmas but we 'll do a double check on that email accounts for my mac figures we have no lap site that would be good just two cents cheap though see we said sorry the measure is because obviously there 's a much different was this coffee absolutely someone could make great good okay thanks Rob _"

floor is Ruth thanks Colin well thank you may Doggett counselors thanks of the top I mobility access reference group for obvious reasons all refer to the group photostream art from now on and I was wandering wandering down before you 've received your business papers for day today just how many of you were aware of this group of what we did could show homes from counselors okay that 's good good thanks for that indication of your level of awareness and hopefully over the next 20 minutes you 'll learn a lot more about us I 'll start by running through the terms of reference but I think you 've gotten your business papers then and then read on to our history to date and Ted Jones we 'll finish our presentation with details on where to from here the terms of reference were written them jun 2015 mag is to build the council 's understanding of the needs of people with disabilities and how these can best be addressed in order for the council to meet its obligation to support the new zealand Disability strategy vision of a fully inclusive society and I think you 've also got a in front of you take so the role of to mark is to provide feedback and advice on a council service delivery policy development draft policies design and planning team args intended to be a first point of contact between the council and people with disabilities the group 's not intended to remove or reduce the council 's responsibilities to obtain further input from other sources of expertise and Ted 's going to speak i 'm on such source next members of team and also expected to provide new initiatives to be considered for inclusion on councils long-term community plan an annual plan were also available to provide submissions on other council plans and policies membership is expected to be representative of the broad spectrum of issues for people with disabilities and relation to council activities for example a membership of the moment represents the Royal New Zealand foundation of the blind Age Concern town center tower by top appearance center the local and disability trust Somerset retirement village and grey power while mobility scooter users those who use wheelchairs and also drive and also it was entered and nowadays as a member of they likes the HP Disability Support Advisory Committee so where we are quite a board representative group as intended the great pie also set up some groups to progress particular issues of interest and recent such groups were formed to advise on the redevelopment of juju straight and the icy baths a membership should include up to 12 members and two councillors with the recent resignation however of councillor keith kreis and x mirror slim cooper no longer representing the council the two councillor positions on our committee are now vacant so please give your participation some thought as our group needs terview to step forward to provide good counsel representation feedback and guidance further to membership we don 't stick strictly to number as it 's more important that the group has an appropriate makeup rather than the number of members been strictly limited and the criteria for membership includes the experience of living with a disability or an awareness of the needs and issues affecting people with disabilities members should also represent the board impressed supplies experiencing disabilities and not limit their use to a commitment to the vision of telford escaped as a fully inclusive community team are currently mates at six weekly intervals from 1030am to 12 noon on Wednesday mornings an Inuk seat for 12 the March members of the council 's community 's support and services division service team AG meetings and the current contact as neighborhood broker Rose presque who does a wonderful job of keeping our secretarial and admin work after both the first two mag meeting was held on 6th of july two thousand and five and the initial meetings concentrated on the most used areas of the central business district area and a list of issues to prioritize was compiled by august 2005 and many allows first problems and our fixed as the reference group developed a community support team involved other divisions of council so now we have regularly roading craving building control compliance engineering and special project managers attending our meetings to inform and gain feedback from us it brings me to some early quite special projects we 've done over the years and featured here as the mobility access brochure this was developed Council the objective of the brochure was to inform community members and visitors of accessible facilities such as banks ATMs accommodation dining parking public toilets respite care and medical facility so it 's quite ambitious project the brochure includes oops the brochure includes assessments and writings of the facilities listed the light rain Disability Support trust funded the brochure and local radio network stations promoted up and at the time of its release in two thousand dollars 2011 it was available from this district council officers and I sites and Talpiot cheering and mango key know as well as from the respite care facilities and accommodation houses listed other success stories other success stories over the years include the huger street upgrade you can see by the pictures of the slides there that for pedestrian crossings a very disability friendly and they 're a yellow tactile tile so arranged and strips across the road for guiding the blind across the street the decorative fence features keep the pedestrians limbs with en were designated crossing areas and the integrated seating units are a welcome feature for those who need somewhere to during the upgrade we also advised on mobility carpark sites and access and to shop entrances and recent here 's a number of new mobility car park spaces have been installed including rise near the taupo library and the great ike center and along your pee street hue hue straight time a moody street and also at the acacia bay shops in response to issues raised at tmag mobility scooter parking was provided on the footpath on our mat a nice treat eh where can i park brochure has been developed this information can now be found on the council website on a new parking page featuring a map which we which will be fully interactive once it 's fully developed that 's a work in progress at the moment I 've had a a bit of a play whether that 's that 's quite funny actually you can pre play in your parking when you go to town minutes fully running we 've been involved in the AC bars upgrade and I pleased to report that now people of age or weight related disabilities can access the to 25 stairways they foot on there there 's also a lamp and leisure pool for wheelchair users and changing rooms for the disabled and one of my favorite subjects here you and reconstructed curb pedestrian cleared crossings on our meeting a standard practices this prescribes a smooth shallow transition angle through the the water drainage gutter and it 's also pleasing to observe that these curb see a standard issue and all the new subdivisions around the district now however the curb crossing workers know any a finish there 's a lot more needs doing we receive complaints from visitors and locals alike they are old uneven steep and dangerous curb crossings at every t-bag meeting and even in the central business district that 's probably where most of the complaints come from there 's still many such crossings around town and all who use them have welcome for long overdue insulation installation of the pedestrian refuge islands which have been which feature the tactile pavers for the visually impaired say and safety handrails and less been installed and busy streets around the CBD and of course I like to us along the lakefront enhance our beautiful district 2 these photos show the tongariro south to main the link between mayor and the great lake center across story place the main area the main paving through riverside park and the new paving by the ice item to hanging however there 's one little put back after such good progress after the past few years at disappointing to stumble across the rough and muddy gaps and the new 5 mile Bay will fray those make it difficult for everyone to negotiate this pathway and I 'm surely Ferber 's family who donated the money are probably very disappointed about us develop that so why should you support team argue maybe sitting there wondering why we should spend money on providing easy access to everything in the community well according to the most recent statistics New Zealand disability survey one and five New Zealanders are disabled and these stats don 't include people who find themselves temporarily disabled such as mothers to be parents with small children and prams those recovering from injury excellents surgery or temporary medical conditions mobility disability is the older New Zealanders an estimated twenty nine percent of people aged between 65 and 74 and 51 percent of people aged 75 and over have a mobility disability and as we 're aiming to become an age-friendly City easy access around our town for the elderly as an important part of earning this title any one of you today can have a car accident on become paralyzed or brain injured you you could have a stroke you could lose your sight or hearing the good news is you would cope because as humans we are infinitely adaptable if we are well supported the key is support its physical barriers and poor energies that actually disabled people so before I hand over to Ted I just like to add that we must not just stop and improving the paving that I 've talked about quite a bit to become a fully inclusive community as in budgets by the New Zealand Disability strategy all public buildings and spaces in our town must be accessible and also includes privately owned buildings intended for public use such as shops offices places of entertainment refreshment should be consulted in the planning stages of all new projects before plans are signed off this includes all commercial projects so leave you with that and hand the presentation over to my colleague Ted Jones she 's coming home I mean Jones I 'm a paraplegic my last by the agency on that wonderful worry BMX bike track you can do it that 's easy this reference represents the three DC has been keen to support the local disabled population but big surprise for me has been the statistically came out the last since that seventeen percent for comment is here people Michelle Nunn disabled for some way it 's huge it is a large Hinnom group of their population and you just don 't see it don 't see that percentage on the streets I won 't work but represents a the social and commercial opportunity trick all challenge and salvation from across the movies but this one mobility reference group is asking the council to thing promote accessibility who is which I actually don 't like using it seems that scribe things to me ezel to be desirable social and economic opportunity rather than a mandatory obligation basically society treats the accommodating disable people as an obligation underneath that there 's a large humanity of the most poorly paid paid people in New Zealand we 're supporting the disaffected number two is we 'd like you to immediately employ an outside auditor to conduct an accessibility audit tell Pope to ultimately evolved TDC urban infrastructure so it 's a game a measure of current shortcomings between each other sounds fabulous a couple of companies in these early set up to do the orders we strongly strongly request to you I 'm grooving the budgets of commission and poured it the town 's infrastructure as a point of reference but otherwise Toki the pin on groups of I really individually only know areas and three commonly regular so you can else we need for our eyes to come and view the town we believe it tourists in other words people from out of town industry or not what substantial part of our local economy and should not arrive here any concerns about physical access to anything when we in advance whether we can be accommodated you will have access those findings influence our decisions as to where we visit and what we do what you spend when we get it took map well in five you 'd like Calvin to be known by seventeen percent is the easiest place there will be varying opinions on this some would say what what the mystic since a lot of our problems are under our feet dito friendly instructive planning demands the use of paving materials that are friendly can wheels prayer we have been frail pedestrians no unread doorways woodchip deteriorate and come straight but it did we miss align cobblestones are threat to visually impaired and infirm as you feel every joint on the road under your wheels car so the wheelchair user feels every compound and the wheels of good cheer great on a bed pain days let me show you tell slopes to deliver hook to the leg so therefore there are no naturally flat areas at all believe me little concrete tile surfaces imagine pure magic the cheer there are only so many times that you floor there you see buying something catch your wife aging demographic will encourage more big box without me the nation is getting older from what you want to go in drawers not good news for downtown because rules over flat floors will become even more than IRA between MS nopers presumably the TDC fired Universal building cone accessibility standards may accrue the status quo will not satisfy future need change in thinking that anticipates the changing demographics will be required like any other town opportunity to move early gained a national reputation the town was infrastructure and environmental friendliness just to conclude consider this should fire be taken in this building yeah and now how to the small elevator single elevator would probably automatically disconnect we in wheelchairs and maybe others trying to assist us which surely perish this has taken order please about currently object structure state its column and really appreciate you coming here today and bring this up to the speed of all your good work and working in conjunction with ourselves which is good yeah do we have any questions from the counselors it 's a mentioned sunset villagers one of the one of your groups what about the other retirement villages and capo is there any connection with them and your group as well not currently we would welcome up with each other here may talk to us about issues that they had team AdWords really well grass but the focal point that we conduct cast iniative come up with that summer more 5 minute goes to teen mag and in italy outcomes over the years thank you thank you caso Jones Colin and tip I just wanted to say thank you for coming today because from my personal point of view I mean I understand we have obligations but it 's but understanding the awareness some of the challenges actually face you guys and what they might be in tune of opportunities so I guess for my point of view and if my fellow councillors think with your time you know click some of time and effort to get here and you 've obviously put a lot of work into what you 've done and most communities lucky to have you thank you and to the counselors are met by spent a day in a wheelchair around town sometime I rather with us so many cancer body would be more than happy to be averaged more wheelchair okay well thank you besides every size okay grateful all right thank you tape and thank you cold nice to see you there 's a suggested a resolution Aaliyah do I have a moment of it just before you put the resolution you worship and we just dealt with the annual plan we 're going to be dealing with a long-term plan can any of the officers say whether this audit is incorporated in any of those long-term plans if not I would suggest that we add something to this resolution perhaps we do address it in the long term plan process so you can to be thanked for their presentation and cancel perhaps accommodate or in the long term plan auditive what you call it accessible still ordered external audit for the disability whatever look I won 't sleep oh yes a look at ted putting a slurry obviously noticed them see what the cost is to the disciple of so you think minutes and just keep resolution as it is okay I 'd liked in the resolution it 's okay being in the minutes but I find that if we 're not careful we lose the things i 'd like something recorded in there in the resolution that we do actually have a report back yeah lost to what else are on the cost of us a 10 would it all yet please saipem yep the you got on take a frontier that 's the word I wanted yep let 's be moved by Councillor clink so Cuadrilla delicious cancer body dead amended resolution are you okay with that time happy

management issues will be discussing as the meaning of community resilience really great that will be able to go down there and be proactive and with that and the third thing was we adopted in principle and the emerged with fired a district proposal which has been in the pipeline and being something that central government have been talking about since 2008 and so in it 's something that could be enforced upon us so we 've agreed with it in principle at this time and we have our CEO on the M steering group and currently involved in negotiations on on how that 's actually all going to

that be basically they fill up and then you you no longer getting the income 3 mr. chairman this is a show you not so much for cemeteries year because it hasn 't been able to happen but with private water wastewater schemes and I think we briefly mention late today that out their experience nationally is that private providers often see things up then doesn 't go as planed and so take it over from a public that the speaker is actually some older cemeteries in the country as well and that have actually got to fold stage one in particular is in power and eventually it took an act of parliament to transfer it to the council and because they do become unprofitable goes in page 9 a question 8 CDC does not support a mandatory requirement the resource consent to be publicly notified once again why and I won 't basically am defer to my sort of resource management experts here and but basically the effect of the associated with crematoria will elude it to having a consent anyway which will have to be publicly notified it just was good maintaining some flexibility yeah okay Kristin 60 on the same page then once again local regulator TDC support in Statuary clarification however does not believe as appropriate comets civilly on the issue and you 've got questions the other page 18 and 19 was 18 and the one before that 17 was the same not making comment1 reasons for that and basically because so that the submission is based a couple of those Christians are but personal and and aren 't really a our position to make comment on and the other ones associated with the actual own courts and the family court again basically Ministry of Justice is much more in a piece of position to make it come in on that not us thank you okay any other questions that suggested resolution ear but it 's a bit move castle park is seconded by Councillor cousin thank you very much all those in favor place art is against good item remember Tim so look at and policy that 's me must see you basically this one it 's extremely out of date policy was it was actually more of a guide and rather than an actual important policy as such and will be made obsolete with the new legislation coming into force and this is not an anything to do with the establishment of a local alcohol policy and we will be holding workshops with you in regard to this in the new year I 'd move the resolution you wish shrink you cancel really yeah anyone seconded all those in favor please say aye aye those against okay thank you very much Jane okay okay item number 11 and you 've just been tabled a new what do you mean did document see when got that Tina it spring on bishop and some guidance with a brief that 's really the engagement once the agenda item that was in what they item that was a new agenda and take into account whether you were going to do an LTP process or an annual plan process of us is now based on the annual plan process that you 'll be carrying out so there 's some additional workshops that have been now included from the original agenda item there 's also an additional metadata I think thing reserves in dog 20 free so apparently does items being needed to be looked at by the committee okay all right councillor Truman that 's the retreat yes yeah that 's us council only retreat Tim ferry heaven for spiritual retreat um yeah okay so it would like to go for you I think I believe you babe and there go through these counselors do I want to go through the name out of the resolutions you have an ex parte a sub conferences and professional development opportunities and a previous meeting talked about making good decisions and then some councillors indicated that they were wanting to to attend that course and i think these several councillors who need the refresher so those dates are now available and really want to have some idea in terms of what dates might be suitable and who might like to go bearing in mind few berries probably reasonably busy councillor park and before we get that 's because i can 't cut him in bed who 's interested in what but I just it was made pretty clear at the last council meeting about how some councillors about about spinning money and necessary money 's on attending things and I know we 've got a number of councillors in the room that already had their making good decisions certification and I just note the difference in cost between recertifying versus and sinning councillors away on the foundation course and I just wonder for of conference and professional development there 's the hips and it might be more prudent at this time can sidering the people around the table that have got the certification how often they 've actually used it from the last three years and bit perhaps we just look at recertifying those already qualified rather than heading adding more to the mix at this point if just just comment casual George and your worship I just like to make a point and there 's a big difference and training and understanding the resource management it compared to go into a conference down in Wellington to have some dinner and listen to a presentation um just for the record I think what we should be looking at is probably not having everyone certified however and I don 't think the difference in cost should be the basis on the decision of who goes and who doesn 't and I think there 's a lot to be learned we keep getting reminded as new counselors that we need to learn and understand well I suggest that it should be in your counselors that mo accreditation lips if they would like to save some money and the fact that no one 's attended any hearings you have a suspect that those circumstances will change in the next two years ok excuse me worship an idol superb I just make a comment that is a fellow member of the emergency management committee I find their comment extremely insulting and I wish for an apology from their new counselor and there has no idea what an emergency management conference and Tails actually and I can send you the report from last time just for her to clarify that it is not about eating dinner and Wellington hello look forward to seeing a report but no apology will be coming from the side of the table today ok Oliver just yeah we 're just I 'm gonna relax I think the year and curlies to our fellow councillors be good too absolutely because I any other crews and this is an unjust got a queer this making good decisions as X through the rmi or what yeah yes here this origin they initially equipment on the initial a consentir which I did do a few years ago but Oh My Mind 's lapsed I bet them you know whenever the time did the storm and so anyone that 's got a particular interest in resource management well i have but i don 't think i don 't think i would go with that cost that and maybe counselor can can explain what the advantages may or may not be and how many times you 've caught on to make the decisions whose then travel accommodation you talking two and a half to three green it was a what is the question you do isn 't it some nineteen hundred dollars foundation force yes at some night away in the recertification as if i can you wish up more than an officer on the cost of it but what i would say is that there 's some credit ation processes pretty clear to be valuable and more than just for resource consent hearing so yes you have to have it if you 're going to be doing resource consent earrings but for matters like what we discussed this handy for a whole raft of decisions at your makers councils going for you wish you could only asked mr. green where can we get information to actually sit at home in front of the fire and read it I 've gone to many many conferences and seminars and learning sessions in the last 50 years and if I started look back on the value of them while it 's all very nice at the time he also gives indicators used it and three years I 've done about the others I 'm sure there are better ways to do it let that arm open to suggestion to you have 13 and yo if you want to do the hearings you 've got to attend this particular course and is there is some information online which I can provide you a link to a few if you want and what I would say though as a dessert computer to other courses that as included we follow us essentially it 's a degree that 's run by the University at sort of degree level stuff it 's comprises of and i pre-assessment so you wanna do an assignment first based on reading that you to do is then is a three day course in Auckland includes a lot of learning training in role-playing and then a follow-up assignment at the end of that so it is pretty full-on I think the pass rate of something like seventy percent about thirty percent of people fail every year hi Pam you passed easily you wouldn 't want us to come back admitted with failed in game 15 on that point it was raised a minute ago think the drugs that we do have a busy februari to those dates of any plane sessions my team get more important to go here and your plantation in scouts rate yeah go discover who is actually pretty good at the moment because going in cancer girls right right year so there 's but then pretty thin on the ground I 'm not say and so who is inland interest in going away probably like I 'm your worship I 'm entries doing going but I was just going to look at I looked at the dates me the best window was the seventh and eighth of May yeah okay anyone else who counts of cousins and myself indicated back in the day but I when you have to make these decisions by there 's an opportunity not married if everyone we can bring it back we 're going for you to consider before my so we to bring it back on and and April May grateful for you to have another look it so that a refresher course is just one day I believe that something it is that 's the recertification assignment yes ok so you wish order then be possible for how sleeping to be re cease enjoy so far it 's gotta be certified and you can take that curse this is signed on okay so we 've got a year indication that counselor jalan school go to the one on the synth may and possibly you plus the body and cousins will make the descendant of every meeting and here we go to a certification course yes it 's not one of this rod until probably March or possibly maybe I can strike at the military and this cancer treatment so you so you 're a certified at the moment say your win does that come up my lad to this knowledge Matt 's a yield about mom you 'll be due for recertification though a so what you have believed it will feel breathing make a call on the date in so long Mosley you don 't know a little lad you SMS him and they may they may ways that it will issue for us because some ever cease to if council still want to be involved in conceding hearings which you don 't have to be but under the current delegations you are then we need to have some at least one member to members actually certified at all times negation and if we wait until for the rig to a march for the later says oh and you might not achieve Eon that course because it might be folks they do fill up quite fast in it will cost you more because you get really good faith but then if someone doesn 't pass them over the situation well which one would you prefer and councillor Hicklin may your large natural make-up probably the one in Wellington of probably sweet me I think 20th amar you format a match I am totally cool does that affect any of the other meetings that we just we haven 't done gone up tomorrow this is just great we could just open the season 13 the energy until 20 from okay whatever yep and in cancer treatment you okay with it well you got elapsed a voice so you also carry kit you can 't keep going soon you look pretty good to me but you need to count wanna focus you know waste of a perfectly okay so I got there this number 3 neo upon whoa killer in the eyes on zone subcommittee wow these are a couple of appointments that we 've done when we did our round of appointments and that was that why can 't a regional council haven 't set up their committee structure I 've now done so 28 that November and is the ability to appoint a counselor to each of those two other one being like 20 so it provides opportunity along with a deputy as well okay so who 's interested consider number four is like my right eye where many mango pit area is basically from just below the falls to karapiro I don 't know you have quite a large catchment much can

    "text": "right item number three their decision to review and I mean the revenue and financing policy we have mr.ellerman hemmed and mr. Jeff Green to present to us thank you gentlemen good afternoon so web worship I wish to move an amendment to the proposed ocean on the pie onion into paper sure so sorry can 't accepting the amendments at the state will just deal with the item first and then we 'll ask for Christians and out and go from there so just have the the officers present police first thank you I think you wish up and this paper comes to you you 're a Quist if the council 's request basically you have asked officers to provide some information so mr. Boone can you talk up a little bit I think can everyone hear back here now you just need talk quite clearly pleased and it 's quite layout that 's fine so that they so this information comes it councils request we have asked officers to provide some information about the implications or otherwise of changing the rating system from capital value to land value goes through the issues that would be associated with such a change and the key points that I want to point out in terms of that is basically a fundamental issue is there to change from capital value to name value would require a long-term plan of inland their processes outlined in the agenda item and but does require some considerable work and terms of consultation in terms of having audits done by ordered new zealand and the like it does come also at a cost and I guess the couple of key messages though from letters that that at the current time officers believe that the information isn 't isn 't complete enough to want such a change in there is you 're aware things such as valuations of the district are occurring and in objections at the parent line so we don 't actually have a fundamental bass line starting position to consider what the effect of such a changes mr. Mahina soon will go through based on the current set of facts that we 've got what what the change would be as of today however we the evaluations aren 't yet finalized and so there 's it does require a long to implement if we were to entertain a change there was a view a limited time to be able to do that between now and the end of the financial year and which we would would need to be able to to complete the change by officers have a very strong consumed at due to their time we don 't believe that we could undertake that long-term plan properly amendment properly we believe that there 's these real capacity and capacity issues for officers in for governance through that period more importantly we believe that affected parties to such a change wouldn 't be aware of the impacts or implications for them at the stage and therefore we believe that the consultation there was undertake that would be undertaken wouldn 't be meaningful in this that 's mainly because of the point that I raised in terms of the final valuation numbers not yet been out and it not being out until the 18th of December and because of their officers believe that there 's such a change at the stage due to the process that would have to be undertaken in the lack of consultation and free consultation that we would have to undertake as part of their process and in with our advice to you is that we consider that we may be found lacking if we were challenged on to amaze us and I say there is quite a high likelihood of such a challenge given the the financial figures that mr. minute will go through which is around changing the shifting the burden from certain sectors to other sectors in the community and to undertake such a change would require you to approve at least 25 thousand dollars worth of unbudgeted expenditure and that 's primarily for the audit fees from audit New Zealand but also for extra advertising and consultation and another significant risk that we rode in fright on the paper as we believe that is a real risk that that in doing with us we may not be have their process complete by the end of the financial year obviously that means that we wouldn 't have rate own counsel but on the community generally in on our reputation and the local government sector I would say that my knowledge no council 's failed to see the rate by the end of the financial year before and they and so we would be ground breakers in the wrong position if we were in that position and I guess finally I would say before we get on to the financial side of it and a key point is that we can 't go and consult on two options in this regard so we can go out and say at the stage as part of the annual plan we can 't go out and say would you prefer a land value system or would you prefer a capital value system that 's for several reasons first again we we haven 't got that information in a place where people would be able to understand it at the state and secondly for the annual plan we would be we need to prepare the annual plan under one basis and that 's a that 's a legislative requirement we need to go on that and so unfortunately the inner planes not a referendum it can 't be like a referendum of the transformation process on something that we that we put out amazing cancel out to the community for feedback and so basically councillors need to choose now which system that they that they desire and if it if their decision is to retain the status quo EG stick with capital value and then the annual plan can be appeared and you 've got a new agenda item as an appendix a time for a timetable for that and if the decision was to be taken that that you wish to appear the annual plan on the basis of land value then the additional steps are met and the schedule would be required but as I 've stated just before we officers recommend that you don 't do that because there 's some significant challenges associated with that in judicial risk so hand over to Ellen thank you few points I want to make we 're in a different space to where we were two years ago excuse me so you can occurred then this is where we are now and the financial information you 've been given shows the effect of a change from today not from two years ago the financial modeling that we have done is for the 2014-15 financial year and is based on the district revaluation before objections and the seven and a half percent rate increase as per the LTP star for the only runs of access to this information so any other financial information being quoted is questionable our district has been revalued and we have legal advice that no side agreements can be entered into with individual rate payers adria attention to page three by five and it explains that sixty-nine percent of the district ratepayers would pay more raids 2014-15 of calves will change the rating system from capital value to land value I think what 's important here is looking at the graph on page 3 by 5 which shows the sectors that would end up paying more being residential 2.9 million dollars rule 2.5 million dollars and rural lifestyle 180 thousand dollars and the sector 's they 've actually paid less of seven hundred and sixty-five thousand accommodation 325,000 electricity generators the 3.9 million industrial commercial of five hundred and eight thousand so what you 're seeing there is a shift in the rating liability of over five million dollars and loading it from that latter group that i mentioned to residential rule and your lifestyle give you that so why you are seeing such a high percentage of your rate payers who will be facing increase rates if we look at page 3 by nine you will see a summary across the district of all the sectors and that is the breakdown at sixty-nine percent if we just focus a little bit on the residential and now only part of the district you will see that district-wide sister seventy two percent of the ratepayers would be paying more under land value if we drill down even further to Talpiot residential you 've got sixty six percent to any eighty-six percent manga keynote eighty-six percent and then the following pages drill it down even further who areas in around the lake so based on our modeling at this particular stage there made and wojo the people are better off under capital value and that is from where we are today not where we were two years ago oh your worship I guess that 's that so from our presentation but in some way and we blew it and that the right decision for council makers that no change is made and we believe that avoids costs and to council financial financially woods risk and as you 've just heard more people were better off and then under capital value than land value and I guess the point f council was of a mind to learn to pass a resolution to change from a capital value to land value and you would need to come up with some very good reasons so evidentially based reasons of why you why you did that and I I say that because as I say there is a very real risk of judicial review if in so therefore in their process one of the things that that would be looked at as what was the rationale behind your decision that you talk so therefore our recommendation any questions Thank You mr. wing and thank you mr. Mann tenant and okay so and Christians in equally spaced everybody we 've had the explanation from staff a lot this resolution for it so we actually got something and I 'll creatures I won 't add any resolutions at this stage only can you show me in standing orders were a sailor cap at just alone please section three point two point one no sir motion must be put in writing signed by the movers state stating that the meeting at which it is proposed that the notice of motion be considered and must be delivered to the chief executive at least five crew working days before such the meeting could I suggest that 's incorrect the reason I dispute what device that you have just been given is the fact that we have on our agenda paper two resolutions 12 stars where and when to depart if you want the official resolution accepted by this council you must put it to counsel to say that this is the resolution a for and against they 're not going to normally do that CEO shaking its head I believe I 'm getting canceled body is one resolution and it 's an item number 31 only at the stage and provide just ask four questions or clarifications from the officers of any counselors please I 've got a question I 've got some information here in front of me and it 's sorry one of the biggest things I put on a platform to at least study capital rates versus land-based rating system for my people now we 've been told all the way along that ninety-two_,_798.39 percent of my district out their strict Maggie 's and I counselor Smith Stewart tonight is going to be better off under kappa rates well I 've got some information here which is from here from Council now maybe a year and a half old but it shows in the Porsche by the poorest ring in town of which they are good there are four very poor socio-economic streets in sealy percent of the really pay more under careful rates as opposed to being under Vantage based rates I 'm concerned that the figures we 've been supplied with this seems to be mismatches and errors and I could be completely wrong I don 't feel comfortable making a decision when I 've got figures which don 't stack up and through the chair the information you have got is the information prior to the adoption of that long-term plan cincy in the district has been revalued and the information that has been modelled here is the information as it today not 18 months or two years ago it is robust and it is if you do not accept the information that we 've given here is not much I can do about it it 's been done on a professional and until method and it 's based on the whole database that sits within our system I can add to that mr. chairman the the pain that they 've people experienced in 2012 that 's that 's the issue that you 're bringing up and that 's the information that related to that time things have changed in revaluations is a big part of it but also the 0 the service as part Creek figures how do we cast on okay so yep councillor cousins how do we how do we juggle them in how do we come from being seventy percent in one of the worst streets and towns have been what you 're saying is now noise two percent positive because you are dealing with two totally different scenarios how please well we have got a meeting for example in Turangi which we are attending tomorrow night is about the revaluation of the district and the fact that the values have dropped so dramatically it is those values that have been fed into this model to come up with a scenario that eighty-six percent of the tyranny region will be paying more under land value than they would under the current capital value basis 1930 rainy township the information you have gotten is historical as I said at the beginning of my presentation this is where we are today that is not where we were two years ago your Cure ship could i pick my house Chancellor Harvey so first degree also canceled body to Christmas tree I totally disputes of get to the issue a little bit like cancer cousins over the I stood on a platform another thing at least six other councils and this room did that would look to redress the business of capital value and ctv value that has not been done it 's the reason that i have wished to put puts us in that direction the questions I 'd like to dispute with there are two staff members are some of the comments that they 've made first that we can have one off agreements with ratepayers now after last meeting when this was discussed at a workshop Island back to and local government New Zealand now just what I 've said the first reply I got from was a doctor might read that was followed up by death or Stevens and he is very clear when you said if you have a property on your role which is exceptional ie materially different in use and possibly value from any other property you may set a differential likewise I believe that properties such as hydro dams could be rated under their own differentials and legal information we were given at the workshop our 30 grievous fiercely States 's and you were widths case where the jugs accepted the authority of the council consumed which I think what 's wellington the council was proven to be correct because it was reasonable however we have the Mackenzie District Council one in regards of electric or electric court the court ruled in favor of electrical because it was unreasonable the second point you made or in just on that basis I 've followed that up with looking at central ok go 's District Council which in fact is on land value like us when you read what the way they strike the general right there they have dan 's the fearsome we look at is a residential rate for funding the gym look so the residential rate for funding the general rate in Central Otago the seats in the dollar is 0.12 eight there are three dams involved to rated at 6.5 91 cents on the dollar one at six point one eight seven seats and the dollar and the turret power scheme in roxboro is 11.2 can got some other other than somebody Zealand just getting to the question i know the homes are the owners are you making a statement around disputing effects and figures that we can 't do things okay oh now we are now move on to it and it 's true that you know it 's time to let loose taking and i think there is a misunderstanding here between the concept of differentials and the writing system the concept of entering into a separate agreement to favor or otherwise any individual ratepayer what you have referred to there is differentials we apply differentials and under the current rating models we applied differentials under the land value basis what the legal opinion that we circulated and which was legally privileged and in confidence basically said that you cannot enter into agreements with individual rate payers that 's totally different to the issue of differentially okay you have any other questions cancel button off yes I do the second one that we 've been thrown Ellis 's is the fact we live in fear of a judicial review and the fact we that we may wish to follow when in fact in our agenda item today you 've got to time scenarios one starting at the end of january one starting at the end of februari which would be adequate time because that 's a similar time you took with your Lantern plan but only judicial review it 's to do with procedures and what it sexy states here councils are beginning to work towards approval of a draft in your plan 1450 if they are sufficient to support Liam Valley the quickest and cheapest way to have rain barely reinstated is to put to the vote when council approves a stress and your plan for public consultation following public consultation submissions council will head in have the opportunity to vote for a lot Elaine Valley in its final version and its annual plan now very quick last manana your questions have been raised about costs well here 's a disc that was circulated some years ago and regards of a development on the green and I can 't go list here best speed money from this council the University I am democracy is not an issue Thank You counsel body near what was those to me no the first wished or the question their worship as I understood it was the risk of judicial review and we have provided you with you write it to you in the agenda item a and a potential time frame if you were to take underplate the change and what we 're stating mirrors there we believe that that is quite tight and even in doing that and we still believe that the pre consultation and consultation process that would merely be expected wouldn 't be able to be followed as an example of it the last long term plan worship the free consultation process was about six months and length so in that 's what you would expect for a change of the size in terms of people being able to understand completely the issues at hand and how it may affect their you know it counselors cheers it 's just thinking about and you just send gas about and you said earlier that at the moment staff wouldn 't have the information for and capital value as it stands today so and also that in the LTP we have to readd rs4 look at land value and capital value as a matter of work because we 're going when we go into that process is that correct and the the issue of land lu capital value is covered in the revenue and financing policy and the river you impart fun is in policy needs to be reviewed with every long-term pain so that is jus next year anyway well Nick the next financial year all right so um said so in actual fact long value and capital value and their financial side won 't be looked at again in the long-term plan and if we don 't to inflame that that any council does has to look at as its rating somehow receives its rates and so yes they will be part of their discussion as part of anything to inflame like every long-term plan that we do I mean difference this year is that we 're dealing with an annual plan yes that 's a slice of their long-term plan and essentially on and an option and basically it 's not an option of what lot land value in heaven value its options of levels of service and how much the overall raters and then the third and long term planners or an amendment which we 'd be doing in consultation born alongside the annual plan this year has their net discussion hey and you see that if we did it in the onion found that staff wouldn 't have time for people to actually go in and have a look at the differences that one value and capital value would have and on there late so they couldn 't actually make that just an informed decision and know enough about the facts and figures and an annual planner feeling forward with it now it 's what the Lupus right um mine Christians would staff have time to have it done so that it could be looked at in conjunction with the phone financial side of it in the long term plan so it could be looked at me once the revaluations have been sorted out which is probably late februari we a model online for online access or over-the-counter that could be looked at property by property yes thank you I was just wondering if that would help a scouser straight path Thank You mr. min Herod gasoline yes thank you your worship I 'm really quite concerned about judicial reviews we have a legal opinion and with the time frame that has been said i would like to you of the information that if we defer this decision to the review of the long-term plan which I know it puts it back another year quite aware of that but it it would give it hopefully we would follow the correct process in terms of the local government take we would go out earlier than normal on a long-term plan so that we do consult properly then give the public plenty of time to submit and I 'm I at this stage with the resolution and the information I am not prepared to put this council in a position where we are under add additional review and i think that the program that is said is too tight and we would of the community that will be disadvantaged I would like to see that this be deferred and properly dealt with under a long-term plan review because that 's with the financial revenue policy should be dealt with yep okay thank you can so clean councillor Jones um mr. hickling is just basically talked about an option as an amendment to this resolution yet we 're not giving mr. Boddy airtime to suggest house but I guess I just wanted to make a statement to I 'm quite disappointed to see a resolution like this were effectively closes down all discussion on this matter and the current paper that we 've got from staff supporting this resolution i would put christian to you mr. mean henan is actually quite unbalanced because what it is missing for us to make a good governance decision a some form of assessment and recognition of the arguments that want this policy reviewed the papers that have been put together here are very unbalanced and put starts to put us in an untenable position as far as I 'm concerned to to simply look at one economists will tell you that lv is a far more efficient tax because it doesn 't discourage improvements in economic development but this is an even endless paper at all for us to even terrible and discuss but what we have here is a resolution that is going to close down this discussion and i 'm very disappointed and I 'd like a responses to why the years in this paper is so unbalanced thank you I let 's put it this way we came up with the financial implications of a change from capital value to lay in value this council asked us to pull together a paper this was two weeks ago for this particular meeting which we have it is up to counsel whether they are comfortable to shift the liability for rates from one sector to another and all we are flagging is that if you go down that path the path this is the risk that you face and if you look at fetching on what council heckling with referring to if you look at adding a liability further liability of two and a half going to slip the other hand is some from our respective two sons with another question as well I stand by their the the summary that we 've given on the paper 3 br2 in three bath 33 bar for org of the and the two different options and the advantages and disadvantages fall in I guess from officers perspectives you 'll see that there 's only one disadvantage that we see in terms of retaining the status quo and we do not see any other disadvantages and hence my comment earlier that if you were to decide to for a change and then you would need to come up with some good reasons for their worship emotions could I cash flow javi yes I I tend to agree with counselor who cleans thoughts and I don 't necessarily agree with some of my other fellow councillors being a new counselor I 've looked forward to understanding more of the reasons for the changes and I do now understand more of them and I don 't think the public of had the opportunity to understand them we 've had workshops information I think that I 've studied thoroughly and I 've had further advice from other advisers of my own so I do understand a little but further I still haven 't got my head right round at all but there certainly is more information to be gained and I do think I have a more of that balanced view now and I see that the public would appreciate that I think more as you learn more about it and there definitely are not normally is there for some of the other sectors with the changes if they were to be made back so I think there are a lot of areas that you do need to know more about before further changes are made so I agree with counselor had claimed that i think more time may be needed to understand that and perhaps look at that further whether it 's however it is that 's my that 's my dad 's for javi wish it through you can somebody because this respondent here to the answers from the top table I had a feeling and I 'm sure thought the direction that this council was given to staff was to look at the opportunity for the public to debate this issue as a change the long term plane during the annual p.m. process now can be done and north of dis ballot in regards to the eroding text this year where they change long-term plan to have another rape and Rohde that was the direction we got here sitting on this tray were saying we where we want leAndria pepper belly we were opening up to those hundreds and hundreds of people that made submissions 18 months ago now if I 'm not met how I apologize but I don 't believe that i am and i also say this business of the judicial review as a white hearing it 's oren beanie the judicial review is on procedure not content so we is to you if up that the procedure this we could be but we won 't because we 've got staff to make sure that we don 't any other questions budget airlines just um both you under the disadvantage that you 've stated here that the revenue of financing policy in particular rating spaces should be revisited you 've got some members this seven new faces here at council which probably shows that there is more than some of the population weren 't happy with the decision it was made i I feel the lead we need to be the consultation well this wasn 't a question actually sorry counselor hoechlin just in response to a counselor bodies so comment your worship I 'm it is about the process that concerns me and going through the annual plan process in my honor opinion is not the correct way to review the financial strategy and I think the time frame that has sat down for us to either approve or not approve is a bit of a pressure cooker situation we are we 're also after have to audit reviews one on the draft annual plan on the long-term plan that 's out of our control basically because we 've got to get audit New Zealand to audit loads and that 's why I 'm saying that to me the correct procedure is through the it back that 's where I am in skin flick in any other Gaza Strip and that 's what I was trying to get out when i was talking before but as this thing is this the right time to do it and with the consultation that you need to have idea so that the figures can be compared properly by everybody in the public and so that there the decision is made with really really solid information much and not with people sort of thing you know I don 't quite understand but and in resent in decisions I think it would be far more transparent to have it full information out there and that can obviously be done in the long term plan and I 'm just wondering if that can be put in somewhere in a resolution or does it happen later or what would be the process from now going through this achievement and the long-term plane will always look at that anyway because one of the requirements is that I 'm doing a long-term planers that the revenue and finance in policy as assist in of it so that will be monitored here NER for their to take place is that the way it is from a Christian sure thank you and you said that the staff would have that comparison sort of information that could be available online after februari so with the start of the consultation for it to be in the long-term plan if you directed that that 's what you wanted then you so it could be so the the revenue and financing policy will always be reviewed as part of the long-term plan it has to be and if you want us to undertake a pre consultation process before that investments indicated that we could do that and debris next year but into the last year and there could be undertaken it right well it is that an option okay thanks guys asteroid any other counselor Jonas I just like to put it to my fellow councillors that the whole debate on how this community is charged for its rates and how they pay their bills was up for debate since early 2012 the app last long-term plan do we bit of position by delaying its theater frankly this policy is actually in transition at the moment and is not actually formally adopted so it is completely feasible to have the discussions now and let 's get some faith in this community and open these discussions now please councillor perk and yet just following on from councillor jolons and I I don 't necessarily think that Harley behind a judicial reviews a white elephant and I wouldn 't even want to find it out for myself and I have thoroughly read the Simpson Greeson legal opinion and I am NOT a fan and never have been under and budgeted expenditure whether it be in five figures or sets and I am also am NOT interested in um squeezing a lot into the timeframe bit I I deem unnecessary after having three years on the format rhenium I think that I am who listened to everything with an open mind and stood again on their platform i 'm also not willing and to take on the responsibility of moving liability of moving rates from one city to another in their other like to seduce the and move the suggested resolution so we have a movie the suggested resolution do I have a second death so you can say something to counselor Troi mean yes certainly yeah and I just feel that this whole junior item is kind of being rushed through and I do think that it would have been better if a lot more workshops inhibin especially with our new counselors because we did go through a whole series of of workshops you know on this issue and last time we 've been into the issue with that open mind and just again looking at this information and the new valuations I still think it 's made the right decision and with you for the whole community the system benefits the whole community honestly don 't see how we could effectively and morally make any other decision in one we 've got so yeah I would like to tickle you okay so we have a mover and seconder resolution we 're looking at your honor are you wish I suggested resolution item number three yes yes the council continues to which uses capital very as the basis for general rate but administered that councillors Stuart 's wishes and councillor her clothes washers that for it to be in the long-term plan and resolute I 'd say that to assure i well do run at Minotaur and yeah how do we get around there okay who does that we were going to do that anyway that 's right is that a lot of green the revenue of financing policy gets its reviewed anyway it would be another decision of counsel if you wanted to go out for a pre consultation process that was talked about with the ability to compare the two systems there would be an additional process it would be a free consultation process of walnut zone and it would be a decision that you would make and no and that 's the decision that we should be making your worship a priest Creek consultation process and that that would be the correct way to clarify wing with this pre consultation process status which what ya you 're what waiting here the pre consultation process would be in respect I 'm in the early to middle part of 2014 and rightly so so we 've got a suggestive is illusion here and would be cool for a slight amendment of a resolution to include that fact I once I itís the mover would you like to move there is this ring I would like to stay with suggests resolution and following on with from what Councillor John and see that this matter should be dealt with today okay so we have a move for the resolution and a seconder for the current resolution is this Z minus like to start either a mean that you wish it which I believe a keen understanding orders can we move this do we need to move this resolution first no you can me that you ok but I wish it might like to see them in oh sorry should 've agreed yet the amendment council bodies got an individual eagle eye glasses on John you 're the new ones is it sorry just saw that clarify that some acceptable amendment metal not just looking at this is mr. rubb God 's be looking at the proposed amendment what it seeks if I read it out this council direct staff to put in place the necessary actions required with the revenue and Finance policy to allow the citizens of tower by district to choose between the two methods available as to how the general rate will be funded during the annual plan crisis 14 15 and counselor body has said that this is not seeking a referendum the problem is that that isn 't not something that the council can actually do because the special consultative procedure or amending the LTP requires the council to put up a positive proposition a proposition hey you can 't legally go out and say we 'll let you choose between a and B you have to put up one or other proposition so my advice your worship is that this is not a resolution and even if it could be accepted as an amendment which I have my doubts on it 's not something the council can actually resolve to do because it 's not legally possible you wish 1111 somebody I must challenge that the choose I 'll go back in history I believe that what the intent of this council was was to take an action that so we would investigate will right the wrongs that happen in the long-term plan all of this resolution is doing is that new to the council is the course of action to take place I can 't see why it can 't_''_2571.65 be handled and in fact you talk of a judicial challenge this could be challenged I believe it 's a fear and right amendment to the substantive resolution that 's on the council paper ok any other the mover of the suggested resolution I 'm you wish that I as the movement of the suggested resolution I 'm I 'm not willing to accept any on the audio chip distribution the name of a resolution cannot debate with an amendment a satisfactory or not that person must stay silent until the right of reply ok we have a mover in the second of the resolution or intend to fool others living on it notes that deputy lunch get into it it 's a fella complete he handed me today to reduce council now I 'll devote being taken yeah I you can 't read it out but I 'm happy for you to circuit circulator understanding orders a member shall not read these speeches except with the permission of the chairperson but may refresh their memory by with your worship as in denial and it is not my litter it 's the movement of group you me that happens to be hospital at this time yes and I appreciate that but I 'm heading for you to circulate I don 't in the end of nimbus can take take government story delivered like to so the minutes right we feel that it 's my my later let you have in the minutes that was circulated not able to be read into it yep have you got plenty of copies the handwritten note for a man who second hospital technology included it demands to me like I 'm an extremely disappointing that you turn down the dipping there 's opportunity to make comments very important issue certainly can be uated cancer body up just said there more than happy for that councillor hooklink so are we allowed to talk to the amended resolution you worship to the mean that where he 's now amended resolution I haven 't accepted I mean whatever is where are we with whether the suggestive is relation is in there at the moments been moved by Councillor park and seconded by Councillor treatment is to your particular queries regarding the encounter Stuart 's in the long term plane that I understand it can be minuted or do have with the officers all right I 'm not satisfied with it just being minuted okay I apologize for that you worship but i would like to really speak against this resolution it 's being punctual e I 'm quite concerned that we not given the opportunity to discuss the rateable value back into the community so canceling do suggest ab would you like to suggest amendment that as far as far as your horses but it 's not councillor Park has said that she 's not prepared to accept an amendment istic yes did nothing do with you can live you can move wigs included of you so wish I 'd have to think what women think what we 'll do is just have a June for a couple of minutes that we could all right there are somebody else must be a conscious I 'll get rid our council body said and put the accounts counselor crates information they are just want to join the meeting four and five pressroom dodging us 45 minutes air brake air we had to restart the meeting will be were there with a suggested resolution mean in the books yet and and and I thought I was open I would like to to add to that suggested resolution your worship to the consultation 2015 2016 on the LTP commences before the end of the 2014 financial year now seeking sir so that 's a new part so we 're part 1 he or was it just a resolution is this you have been then back to the a new part 2 i 'm new cartoons has been moved by Councillor heckling second oh boy so I didn 't get loose Oh Roger Thank You councillor Stewart of the remit of the resolution states that will continue to operate the current revenue in financing financial financial policy if we go to counter it cleans amendment the second part doesn 't indicate what we 're getting at these they would do some contour long-term plan there 's nothing indicative of net on it states will be baiting well the issues that are before us at the moment so we 'll add that consultation on the financial financial revenue funding policy be undertaken 2015 16 under the

might not want to know but one thing I did want to just bring two other counselors attention as I 've had been contacted by probably a handful of members of public in the past couple of weeks about the legal illegal drugs and Talpiot and what what are hos granting the licenses and bits and pieces so I think from a comms point of view it might be quite useful to update the public on how that actually are issuing the licenses and that it 's the police that are enforcing it this seems to be quite a liberal of concern in this community regarding the sale of legal highs and I understand from talking to Tina that there will be a workshop next year for this council does play a role in deciding where those shops are I heard you just to have a check on the Ministry of Health website Tina 's got some lengths as well which are quite useful because it does seem to be a question that 's coming in right my provision was I 've been lobbied quite a lot and then from the UC base-pair annuity 3gs

    "text": "to be held as reserved hello cats got a cellular decision is required from you today is council is to leave ur or not to acquire the land described as a lot for and the attachment independence to toe thing to point to religious entertaining significant natural areas of cross-strait car nagar and the reports fairly detailed so what summarized so much further but i 'm happy to answer any questions you may have sure thanks he 'll just like to acknowledge mr. Trevor dances on the back of the room afternoon miss Patterson ok any questions of this there 's a plan detailed site plan there any questions or queries you wish if I do buddy good just are offered on the front page of the document with the suggested resolution the comments are made would involve minimal cost to counsel with in turn to page on page 42 it states 0 financial consideration and then it states down further there is no minor and known there are no nine more than mine at risk to the council and agreeing to acquire a lot what are those risks I is a minimal cost one supposes zero consideration is meant to mean that we won 't be paying for the land and acquiring it minimal cost is talking about minimal costs in terms of maintaining the land will only be mowing the grass areas so through you your worship we 're not only galleries raped by having that land as suggested this resolution we 're also gonna have an ongoing cost of maintaining it and secondly it mentions on the past last page 43 and if it is a significant area of approximately 2.2 hectares of this prostrate kanika what 's the what are the butcher 's across the road on mate mate on that photograph to me it 's at can occur as well yeah maybe areas so I just wonder why is a council we want to go and buy or take over as a reserve private land of an individual rate payers and then it becomes anyone else can income to counsel say or by the way I can 't use the sleen how they 're making up the reserve I just don 't like going down this is suggested resolution there in accordance of the Resource Management Act council agrees to acquire the land yesterday 's a reserve do I have a mover canceled strong seeking to break out the crate all those in favor please say aye all right okay just grab a shove he and sister yeah okay where 's been carried those against please carried yet it as against cancer the Dodgers would you like that recorded this place councillor Jones and body in them captured hasn 't because okay thank you item number five CBD licenses hello again yeah but existing three-year term licenses to occupy the straight side dining shortly due to expire in a decision as required from Castle is to weave it offer new licenses for the trinitarian a decent resolution put forward as considered a nice balance between illusion and ensuring that the atmosphere of the CBD right side I 'll increasingly return to castles the use of the straight side request cancer back and I don 't know if it 's a Christian or more than I am a comment video I 've got I 've just been increased by only team seats I understand that businesses are struggling but where 's also have alleged it we need to reduce in so I 'm just wondering and I said it the four options are set out but there the resolution is you say is the most Gallants but I 'm not quite sure whether it is the most balanced yes some we must determine that there 's totally over to counsel in terms of we want to go and that 's why we 've put that in the options and effects it in the options and you could increase it by any other amount that you that you wanted up to the obviously the valuation will include of it I guess the balance that you 're going to have to make as council is a balance of wanting to encourage activities of no spaces and so you wouldn 't want to our price the market if you like so there 's the balance that you may thank you your worship could I ask a mellow and Jonna questions well did you consider potentially as an option not the same point as mr. green has just made it 's over to Council okay that wasn 't a consideration these these fees and charges are going around quite a while it 's a change in direction I guess so just like to toe but for discussion and maybe ask for some views around the table and council apart talks about potentially and raising revenue to help increase I did I like reeses the deep secrets and crested it 's a Freudian slip there decrease the dick and and you know I 100% supportive of that but at the end of the day are we talking about sorry nickels and dimes here only talking about fifteen thousand dollars in an increase to a certain level of tune percent which is not substantial would we not be better in this current economic in climate to provide businesses with a platform on which to flourish and say it 's not charged rentals I 'm just putting it out there for discussion would appreciate people 's views of course we would need to complete place compliance me just to give a chanela and then the so these particular businesses here had their take up the whole will take up the other side of the footpath sort of thing yeah so um these sites were identified many moons ago as being potential sites so they 've never really varied in terms of the number there 's been one or two added on but cameras have been around for a long time and so are the rights of these yeah and we have been handed a unless to separate less for tied up on it and go into the individual businesses but there are few businesses there I see not on that list so does it get completely out is there someone that goes around and check these activities at the moment yes there are and already bit less needs changing because business has changed often and new people want to start the streets i donated so we need to see I I guess an answer the counselor jolons question is that you know we 've seen we 've got to be seen to be fear and not not yeah persuading people to go to dear got to be filled so the other retailers as well then if we do encourage all retailers to flourish but no some retailing activities can be traded outside so just got to be keep that in mind any other questions you wish of collisions is really just Christian 52 at the top legal considerations at states in regards in six and ten of the age it will enable efficient effective and appropriate use of local public services and infrastructure near the egg concerns council councils and what which panel x the infrastructure is at the footpath is their infrastructure so we 're looking at using the act but in fact we act it 's weirding very slightly different through that I 'm just just wondering why that would have been put in part it 's says the footpath the infrastructure that we 're talking about yeah okay yes you know so cancer aware that later that was in the tablet times of last week in regards to the outside dining and the I notice that there there 's a regulation of 1.5 meters of space for working I was the Robert Street area just the other day and I can walk single file it 's that policed as well be that 's one of the one of the issues in regards of outside dining your compliance team tends to have a bit I use the term crackdown but that 's not the right phrase they certainly as and when we is meant to be a two-meter sort of passageway between between the book you know so people can pass it 's really hard because I mean you could go down one minute and midpoint chairs in the next minute as we could have come and pulled chairs over that two meters so we release it as best we can but it 's never going to be foolproof we 're never going to be able to police one hundred percent under some of that is because the width of the air for us as well which do restrict the amount of space you can be provided for pedestrians but we do try and work with the businesses rather than against them to make sure they comply you wish it one the Fate we gather to make a decision whether we don 't have an increasing we have team the scene or fifty percent we were given in confidence a list of which there are 20 properties but in the paper here the force is 22 when are we through some of those some of those that so-called adopted Market Market rentals the team percent is going to have a different impact on individual ones depending what they are so we are able to get a full report of all arose before that decisions made ie can must be table to the next council meeting well I 've suggested that there are some little missing and so I appreciate that point and I think probably team perceive reflexive fear sort of figure at the moment and it 's obviously prorated on size of the activity and you know what suggest we could give a thorough report on well I 'm moving your worship that we tables to the next council meeting on the tenth of you seem whenever they take us give anything it 's not too far away I suppose increase okay will you worship I just moved let me get medium procedure i 'll just move the motion and he 's electric for the one for thinking that or it secret administer beta then we go back to the issue that council have is raising that leave it alone i just want to know what you procedures okay so you moved a motion to have a seconder for counselor bodies motion okay so they slap stabbed counselor Harvey you suggested that no increase as we got any comment about that please so we support their argument I see on the conclusion that says that increasing therapies Fatima sin because expected bring financial benefits the council on the context are we going on councillor doors are suggesting you know be more of a distance inappropriate given the market you know difficult current climate food retailing safely okay just clarifying John and la is to win was this forget asked hell how long 's at central head neck or six years sucks you sir yep okay and any of us tree these are you wanting to move that as a resolution not increase this time it 's not going to set a precedent that there isn 't going to be an increase or anything like that it will still be able to come back in would but if they resolution was moved before a three year period unless you change that so before no increase for the next three years and if your excuse me if you 're trying to play catch-up as well if you 're trying to get to a market rent I 'm hearing different views around the table but then it becomes an issue because again you on the bathroom but that might be a conscious decision you make yep sure you wish upon the tariff occasion who was the valley was that direction that market rental who were the ones that actually did the work just in case there 's a litany and they are from here tapo reached in their way so there 's no absolute fence on the rental cash lately so just as a suggestion if we leave the fees as it is right so we should just do it for one year as opposed to a three-year term increase that 's funny good suggestion that is that possible if you have a different kid you just change that if there was that the desire of of the council you just changed part 1 of the resolution so I would say that the lies that occupy fruit for a table 1 year be granted for a new waterproof okay mr. Zell okay yeah and move out Amanda 's resolution silly okay so counselor hicklin has moved resolution is weirded by mr. grim and any other comment said the only Commodore will make is that the officers can possibly go away and just make sure that everyone is compliant on the Syria and you know there 's a few the FF I suggest a not on that list so like as Allah was set it 's a bit of a movable feasts these businesses change regularly yes very rarely get informed about that change of ownership so we play a lot of catch-up yeah so it 's not as straightforward as it sounds but we will talk for those but the video the menu there can change so my invoice in detail is happy now that it might be a jewelry shop in the future so you know sure it is a movable face but which I we try our best okay great well I think that 's a good sensible outcome at the stage has been moved by Councillor a friend that they 're the now increase but to be reviewed next year 's being secular blackouts for body always in favor please say aye hi I those against Ares item number 63 chief executives _"

Louis could you just also just clarify for me just um so that I fully understand the 598 that 's mentioned in the tender is that the full cost to counsel that tender excluding GST and assets but over the three years okay and does that represent any increase in costs or budgets from previous Tinder 's the previous cost was around 200 5,000 per annum acaso very similarly I just clarify must listen I 've absolutely no change in service that explain the wording weighted attribute method what effect does that have on individual tenders weighted it reviewed method as a method of tender evaluation we buy you look at other an elephant price in this instance the attributes that we look there we 're methodology management skills resources and prices one of those all three would have gone through that sound processor yes they are evaluated by a team of three in the middle school on the basis versus eat happy firm exactly what crises are promised to be good he worshipped thank you thank you Miss plus any other questions we have a suggested resolution the hip am over counselor pack single bright counselor jolons or lies in favor say aye against Kerry item number four _"

    "text": "afternoon how are you mere cancels right it 's just a pretty straightforward submission and due to the timing particularly of the elections we did a rather general officers submission and we sent it actually down to local government newzealand to participate within their wider submission going direct to DIA but we just generally accepted any increases that they might bring of funding from the gambling to come back into the community Christian 's wishes and I can understand the timeframe you have a letter here dated the 25th of October that you sent in regards to that submission because I need some clarification on what 's class for what 's the class for venues i think but my real issue is i 'm always reluctant to do something retrospectively and I 'm just wondering as we were sworn in on what date night was it 29 this was sent prior could it have not been actioned on that meeting of the 20 nights rather than you she nearly closed off for the submissions was the 25th maybe I 'll answer look this is relatively common for for submissions unfortunately government processes they give often less than a month notice so so you 'll get something in particular for our submissions in the house that 's less in a month what we generally try and do a suit like they 're very male 22 members so that you get an opportunity and four liter to avoid any you need feedback to us and through the drafting but given the agenda clothes off sort of your council agendas and the time that it takes to prepare that very often it is unfortunately in retrospect that we have to come to you and get for more sign off you will notice that all of our standard submissions that we hear always him the if they 'd said to happen always have a little rider saying his second paragraph the intruder the timing of this request points made council staff comments please note that to the time and has an entrepreneur council so there 's a standard writer that we have in that circumstance that as a given the time frame and a month is probably pretty standard for most consultation processes we their time tremors up in the future we would have circulation by email and what that particular has been happen in this case yeah so generally that the draft letter would would be brought out to you by email any comments any concerns or be on your weekly bulletins those those issues will call back into let their drop in class for gambling is pretty much pokie machines pretty much the Trust 's that run the pokie machines and suggestive isn 't recommendation their resolution sorry but i have a move of counselor cousins against the cousin seconded by Councillor tickling all those in favor please say aye Gary item number 12 I wish at this just a couple of changes and thus so the first one is in relation to the super Otero street and car park workshop which would like to move from it was on the tenth of of December and would like to move that too and the slot on Thursday the twelfth and it

and rotary regarding financial management in two retrospective approvals so you can select clean is attending the training and Carson or tire now on there as well yeah they can be added to the suggested resolution please select and so I become a necessity no question about their financial management training is that their financial governance 101 it 's the one that 's the introductory one so it 's the one before the 101 so yeah I 've already had ten minutes I don 't see the progress in a million obviously you think financial management finished ask the question what differences between first one in Rotorua and then I know the second one in Hamilton he 's a 10 1 minus over down 188 is a 102 I haven 't had a look to see specifically what the differences but I would I 've got the printout of the introductory one which is as I think pretty basic 101 enorme to just just build on that level of knowledge okay to just fill radar could be worshipped but it depends on time I can 't give a definite of planet wise will just approve the expenditure lat nua so anyone else I probably prefer to go on the bottom january-february obviously we don 't have a meeting in January so really

    "text": "okay thanks Helen good afternoon we 're on item number two I will see on an appointment and renew Maury shin for directors um thank you you worship my apologies for lateness I was just making sure I got the following resolutions sorted for you um so we took this morning in a workshop about the importance of the policy on appointment and remuneration of directors and and what the different elements of that are and essentially the purpose is around transparency near transparency and accountability and we 've already had some conversations about how we plan to apply this policy for some vacancies that are we 've become aware of um so um this policy is apart from some small tidying is identical to the policy councils head for some years now so I 'm happy to take any questions on it members read for the policy do we have any questions or queries to have them regarding the suggested resolution Leon item to council adopts the policy the appointment or enumeration of directors can I give a mover please thanks the pack seconded by Councillor cackling all those on something that I should be honored to do with the picture counselor pack just gave me as the community health for me am I missing it a month I 'm slow reader is it on the sheet this is the third renew Maury shin direct icdl in here so the item at three okay so item number three um thank you your worship so council committees um first of all we have to do is create these the Committees of counsel for you at the structure and that you 've planning to operate for the next rhenium and in adopter terms of reference which as we talked about kind of sits the the powers and scope and limits on how those committees operate and then as part of that process then make sure that we elect or appoint people to those committees and we talked this morning about council having a range of different kinds of committees got standing committees special committees and the joint committees as well as a couple of statutory committees that operate under different legislation the licensing committee and the community board for now we a workshop this morning it was requested that we change the terms of reference for the audit and Risk Committee to increase the meeting frequency to quarterly and more as required so we have a resolution for you that captures that amendment and then what I 've put in front of you is a proposed resolution that captures the flavor of your conversations this morning around who gets appointed where so um so this is the item marked number three with some yellow highlighting all over it looks has been tabled you 've got that okay all right you 've got some suggestive names on there and should we just take couple of minutes to make sure that 's one 's happy okay thanks Helen I think you 've done pretty well with turn your lunch break okay let the Europe and here do we have any queries of questions on me the table suggested resolution Lee Elsa Truman well I looked at them and I did wonder sorry I apologize Rosie end okay so that 's good don 't add I am suggest a mover el Waterman cancel heckling those in favor please say aye there 's against carried item number four item number four is about the new rules that the remuneration authority is operating with local authorities around pay for councillors this specifically is around I 'm additional pay for cheers and council committees or counselors who have substantially larger roles than their peers and there 's a bunch of criteria that the remuneration authority will be looking at to work out whether or not it won 't agree to additional remuneration and it 's really going to be looking for evidence of significant and an ongoing extra workload it will be looking at things like the position the additional responsibilities the benefits to ratepayers the estimate of extra time and also the relative job sizes and I 've put in front of you two possible resolutions one is that you resolve to make no proposal the remuneration authority which is that you basically agree to forgo the additional forty thousand dollars of remuneration or that you may wish to provide some percentage of remuneration which can 't_''_406.97 be more than twenty-five percent for the chairs of morning the view was broadly that you felt that it would not be appropriate to I 'm seek additional pay at this stage reiterate that I don 't think these next idea here for any wage increases you know certainly in the general market things are pretty tough and people are struggling out there so I don 't think we should be taken advantage of in particular increase that could be available to us so I would certainly suggest that this no cause for additional enumeration and that could I hear any I was moved further the debate that the first resolution you move it 's been there that 's the council resolves to make no proposals the renew Maury shin authority for additional remember a shin and seconded by Councillor computer all those in favor please say aye those against okay item number five during a Tonga dito community board terms of reference yes your worship um in fact the point about the terms of references that council doesn 't make the terms of reference for the community board they set their own because there are a separate entity powers to the community board and that 's really what this item is addressing for you h5 bar for has the delegations to the community board and you 'll see they 're very broad in terms of the board being delegated functions duties and powers of council that are relevant to them within its ward and essentially that the the wood has the power and in fact is required to make if it wants to make a recommendation or a proposal that holds expenditure they would then they can 't just kind of make a decision all by themselves because the community board has no separate budget for its activities council provides the administrative support for that board to meet council provides the funding for the community boards remuneration but the board itself does not have an operational budget other than any specific monies council votes for it so yeah you might want to delegate some authority and then they can get underway as well the strip is late to information moves against us too so you can cancel cousins all those in favor please say aye carried item number organizations yes can I just bring your attention to item 11 which is not correct and the draft resolution for this appointment says it should say elect councillors John bode and Kirsty Truman body my apologies right so this is the appointments to a whole range of council organizations and community organizations that council for a range of reasons is involved with we workshop these this morning in terms of doing the review of strip this strategic review of these to ensure that this is an appropriate list of organizations and in discussions this is the kind of list we 've come up with around appointments I just like to say there were a couple of appointments where we suggested that we make two appointments rather than one because of the high level of interest among counselors for those roles and now those two organizations were the way or a community trust and biked opal we were unable to get hold of somebody with sufficient decision-making on it you worship I just like to say that I think it 's great that we 're or a community trust it so all about the big picture and I 'm sure we 're all here for the bigger picture and I 'm quite happy to sit down and let councillor jolons take that council observer role on the wire community trust and just um be able to assist and in other ways if that makes making the resolution any easier that 's fine and the same with Mike tofu and councillor crepes and I was approached by bite taupe or two about big if I 'd like to stick a beer on the committee and of course I 'm keen to get involved in anything but again i 'm quite happy to act as an alternative to the deeply me r F F this is more of an epitope for that rather than them expanding their committees which probably have a fair number on already yes you know we could delay those isn 't just until we do get an answer back because we have a meeting on the twenty-sixth November and so there 's a comparative we we resolve on those particular or a house and bike kappa today because wiping the temple society the wiper he won we 've held over i 've got a batch of appointments we still need to do and could i suggest for our house and baked opal given that both our recipients of grant funding from council and grant council support in a range of ways um one of the things i would suggest is that they 'd be unlikely to reject increased council involvement given the financial support they get but the alternative would be that if you wish we can carry on with the resolution as it is and if for any reason they signal they would rather not have two people we could revisit at that point that 's another way through it but we can do it whichever way you prefer and just in saying that in with the m or a community trust number sixteen can I just have it noted that my scene in case yeah thank you and sorry get it down there I don 't_''_822.14 I ok so anymore also we haven 't got another to come through we will resolve on these today and then adjust though okay you 've got the last year yeah suggested resolution you that we appoint their make these appointments can I have a mover goodbye council heckling seeking of our counselor body all those in favor please say eyes right item number king Louis you worship me mr. Lowe 's good afternoon we have here a tender for the road marking a contract mold lot to have the report tabled is read give any Christians in there the road back in country everybody just just two questions you you worship first leads the one in regards to been carried out in accordance with the council 's procurement policies which are like to know what they are the second issue is how much of the subsidy of the 600,000 are we looking at it 's fully subsidized forty-three percent to the council of 600,000 the cost to counsel would be fifty seven percent of that so around yep 4307 bozena of the 600 is what we 're live with account fifty-seven percent is what we would be required to pay and forty-three percent would be in ZTA around 350,000 roughly when we need to publicly tender also sets out limits within the chief executives authority and at 250,000 we had sawed open tender and brought it to counsel for your approval sorry just run past your answer again as to is there a certain amount that can be done without having to go to the changes every that court of a million comes in the regard to the CEO what 's the the quarter million that is the CEOs delegated authority the team to policy currently stands i think it 's at a hundred thousand fourth publicly tended thank you i 'm a will have questions later on just know just emptiness as an excuse me if this is just me but usually when we have a tinder prices up you know there is usually an engineer 's estimate or some sort of technical amount for us to gauge it against is it me or have I must fit somewhere i 'm just wondering with it isn 't as a ginger item I know when I actually open matando sand the engineer 's estimate was actually honored on the tendons estimate 700,000 it was somewhere you see normally it is Iraq yes you 're so there 's been admitted in the near yes definitely didn 't do one ever seen any other queries under I did a question Dennis were there any conflicts of interest identified during tender process no no there was none follow-up question your worship this money would have been budgeted in either the long-term or annual plan correct which one can you sit in fighting annual premium yes you should worship just a question of I 'm a new counselor just to regards the tender process and I haven 't read the manual so I don 't know from a real estate background which something Rosie havia from tender process doesn 't normally mean that you 're going to accept it tinder it 's always submit further negotiation does it ever happen you receive the lowest tinder the summer from Count 's will say yes we 'll look at that but shave this off it or give us at that does that ever happen and someone sues you so that does happen typical one all instances it 's 5,000 here or 10,000 here that 's money we could be saving the tenders so alert on the open market I always tell them until we say what you don 't be don 't negotiate and once they come back typically low Earth orbit future provide further advice on that Dennis because the tender process is tends to revolved around a schedule of rates rather than the actual works they 're being conducted so it 's not a case of identifying that these works will be done with that tender it 's more the rates will apply to the works though it is screaming we do this experiment yet so with something like the road maintenance or the road marking contract we have a fairly extensive shedule of road marking right sorry at the district and the tenderers submit rates for those those seen two lines each lines that type of thing replacement of rpms and then we manage or maintain or monitor the condition of that and so they do X number of kilometers and they use those rates so we we can we manage the funding work that they actually do we still say that we could trim those tender spirit if we so wished that 's the future discussion I 'm just saying I think you 've got to maintain a certain and professionalism till you don 't you they don 't want to be the cats all that sort of yeah which that we can worship kind of follow up on it the question that 's been raised by cancer Cousins is very important one there was a long pause when that question just ask the second ago because if there 's going to be shaving off any teen there that show you must take place of all genders so the tenderers in a tender or get the right to come back again or not because isn 't that one of the issues that faced us with what we 're just discussing in workshop this morning in regards to the risk management and things like that so I think we need a very very clear answer what actually happens during a tendering process I 'm quite happy d attended is a tender tendering policy within the tendering you set out and the request for tender what the procedure you will follow it is not normal to go then go back to one tenderer and seek to shave some money off that one if you change the scope of the work you 're obliged to go back to other tenderers and give them equal opportunity to if there 's a change in the scope of the work I thought your worship has that always happened in the past we haven 't negotiated genders we 've accepted the tender as they 've submitted unless there 's been a need to change the scope of the work of Christian wise has that happened in the past for that particular team denied you have the opportunity of tendering for other work as it arises now you know movie yet so we 've got a suggested resolution me that they tend to be awarded to roadrunner Marcus who i consecrate ticket is my counsel if cuz it 's councillor sturr thank you all those in favor please say aye as against Kerry item number 11 _"

the second paragraph where the CEO noted that one of the items the LTL TP issue and the staff were currently preparing information for the workshop I raised the issue about the cv and lv situation at community purposes I 'm sincerely hoping that that can be dealt with under the annual plan process not have to wait for the long term process because that 's not until mid next year well 1415 so and apply some clarification from by the CEO or all the officers that it can be done under an annual prime process through the chair the issue at the stage is just a general discussion and respective cv lv we will go through aspects through the workshop it 's only if council which is to make a decision that will move the rating basis will there need to be a amendment at this stage all it is is a investigation of what the options are for council and you will be advised as to the impact of the revaluation and respect to the different sectors from a capital value basis and from a land value basis and should there be a need for a decision to be made then there 'll be a formal process that will have to be followed thank you give me some comfort that at least we know we are open to discuss that at issue oh thank you Castle body Your Honor worship um just on that very point so effectively as the document here Sears from local government it can be altered that 's a long term plan but they would be part of the in your pain Proteas it will require a process in conjunction with the annual plan which will relate to a alistar amendment to the long-term plan but as a separate process that ma

consistent with the reserves at the purpose of the reserve which is community buildings I 've the parents seem to end the silver band and work for the community and provide community services in the sub lease arrangement has previously been very to my counsel so take the report as being grid and no we have you dancing can still take it from this this type o silver band operation enjoyed your subleasing this question is will ever oh good runs pretty reason to get with it do we have a suggested resolution there can I ask for a mover a bit resolution pers counselor crate signal ok for peasants all those in favor please say aye those against Kerry thanks Ella item number eight and so again under the reserves that we require a decision from council driver 's licenses I will take the report as being read in a pitch as efficient applications here the questions on these application I think there 's a couple of inches there the encouraging young children 's activities which is sorely needed them in the district I feel some simply confident that these concessions will be well used in artists factory where Catholic right the chair was your worship this may not be related but in the case of granting a concession to someone to trade is a particular organization on referring here like to the fireworks display and they go and use contractors outside of our town i 'm getting complaints from some of our ratepayers that is this a an issue to discuss now on worship I just have a question for for the ladies I notice that the granting of these licenses of subjects also a granting of a license from the 24 e to a mary trust board just to clarify these licenses won 't be able to won 't be unless they also get their license or two for each hour is that correct and yes where our position is that we won 't grant the licenses or receive lessons from the past they are currently especially those left under they are currently is showing them now I still edit the license just covers the activity on the reserve not on the water that we system lacks with and patent Chevy I just wanted to to make sure that you know we were facilitating where we could to help these two parties a lineup because obviously some of these operators want to start quite soon and it would be a shame to see any that held up so that 's all on track for the 24 hrs board and they have their own processes yeah just so will you advise the two-footed term board that these license has been was that up to the applicants we can revise them sure I would certainly suggest that because then that means that things need to happen obviously summer is approaching quickly and and would the normal pace of events be that they would approve it first and then come to you guys or the way that we would prefer to work because generally where the activity is happening on the surface of the water we don 't really like to be in a position where we 're granting a license for a Support Activity if you like which is generally the teams and the ticket sales on the land without evidence that to mary transport have actually approved they the main activity which is on the water but the cause of the the lack of time leading up to summer we 're really trying to facilitate this process as much as we can would L mean to take david has worships point it would be great if I mean I know it 's not council 's responsibility to to make the process a lot more smoother I think be done yeah and communication around these applications and they happen to us I came to get the licenses Thank You Ella cancel heckling and the wet and wild slide on my amphitheater is the reserve staff comfortable that I 'm just big concern might be damaged on there on the reserve particularly these water slides they can just scorch the grass up pretty quickly and we 've got the summer what do we call it the summons on certain to going in there just after that so I know it 's only there for seven days but we had the same thing last year so the same activity if you 'd the last year and a team will be happy with the outcome the second time spurious is they will be sweet special condition the grounds a discernible because of flat angle you 're here we know okay pencil part time they suggested reservations number 135 later we have a second then she came through jolly nice pair you wish a clarification and it 's are they all subject any if there 's using the lake which is freehold typical then anything like the we just talked about the middle wild slides it 's free whole council reserved so doesn 't need to vote or crew so move a counselor practicing against Jon Arryn 's all those in favor please say aye all right against Kerry item number nine County depot sites reserve license for children 's left a figment parties hey next then showing being lace braid area to the hospice press and you can see on that net and this proposed interview and that 's going to have the source or so so super hung with you it was worship so I 've just I just have another one more question Ella just in terms of the hospice and what Georgia Ferris would like to do I know they 're adjacent to each other do we have an indication of when the hospice will start construction because obviously that would affect your ability to ride horses at the time so do we know what 's happening in terms of Romans on that psoas and this is only good neighbourly relations it was probably worth making sure those student clashed so they won 't okay so the answer to all children 's picnic Rowdies is right up there um we have any other coming kem sokha yeah I just have a few concerns about the site to your worship we 're getting it really compromised because we 've got now the electric motor cars in that corner you can just see the track around through the yet and now we 've got this 13 on the other side the Year previous council was sort of fairly protective of this the front of this site I wouldn 't like to see any right of renewal and and I 'm really not too happy about a four years license I would like to have seen a six months license with and see how he worked first personally just because I need I think that that site needs a little bit more protection because once we 've won licensed these areas they seem as though they become more permanent and I wouldn 't like to see a permanent operation on that the activity the appreciate appreciate your concerns but I would say there would be too much participation in the winter but council three oldest I think the year is pretty minimal anyway really gets the crepe can I just clarify where bouts does the bike park that we 've already gone to permission to go on this map here allison is it is it further down oh it 's down on that part they are okay yeah that 's yeah under clear opening rip between the road and was this unit thank you vision on on page 2 of item 9 there is discussion and it 's got special conditions and they will probably count anything that can say queen is a concern over ponies in different tricks oh sorry counsel pack he 's thank you your worship I just um hit some queries around and then being used for children 's birthday parties and a beat and apart from the pony rides and the bouncy castles I 've effects a great idea but what about our toilet facilities eating facilities is usually birthday parties consist of what the kids in the rest I just wonder how how it 's going to work istic Lee for Georgie fair shame yeah that was one of whom million concerns heaven get torrent for certain and we played will be given to a cage of one of the core absolutely be quite some distance from me they wouldn 't know it 's just a giant ogre 's triceps area oh it 's justified the northeastern Louisiana ok so there are toilets in the early that 's not a public to it but I 'm not I bow of the time available Queen yoki but appreciate now they come in again so the consumer life yeah it 's got it miss her and the proper explains it could hear the taller business why they have to go sort of for a semi industrial site t to get the toilet that tab obviously in your operation agreement with them just it has been noted by the council that makes all this it 's all done properly I just village that you worship just in regards benefit adjacent is that industrial site and their people working area to have young children walking through and use the toilet facilities it 's safe I would say they probably media companies but it without me yeah and it 's not like so but from an industrial point of view as it a safe area it 's not used for any under and arash regulations and it 's not used for any industrial activities if I at prism that is occupied at various times by licensees who use the buildings for storage and the main one that would affect that end of the yard would be in Britain Bujji licensee who has their stall at the front of the yard that uses the sheets of the deck of the art for storage I 've just got a few safety concerns as a parent that I think it 's a great idea in principle of they just be noted 22 Georgie that you know they make make sure this part of it once ok there 's suggested resolution there any other country ever a mover for that please answer Truman syllabi counselor Stewart all those in favor aye ohs against Kerry director okay we go back _"

    "text": "just like to speak into the microphone so you don 't have to stand they can yes they seized it and and in the part of any debate so item number three as the appointment of deputy Mia and you know I 'm proposing to have a movie release resolution that confirms the appointment of mr. Keith crate to to the position of deputy mayor keith has been part of this district for many years he is a huge respect for life here is a top polling counselor he has huge support in the community and we 'll do a fantastic job I believe he has all the support of the counselors and I 'll be proud to have him as my deputy and please believe he will be a very loyal supportive and constructive deputy so damn that I would like to move that keep great to be appointed as deputy mayor of the District me great pleasure to seek in debt resolution but since we moved by myself and conceded by councillor park all those in favor please say aye those against Gary your worship can I use 't have that chain on so first you your worship thank you for your having a confidence in me i use all those words that you use i feel humble proud privileged to take on this position and i sent my fellow councilors for supporting me and I promise like you do to do my best for the community and get a future for this community that we truly deserve thank you collector confidence in me thank you okay item number for standing orders Rob dogs three cats a solicitor yeah walk is through this one thank you you worship this and counselors this part of the process some extent is known and the game is reading the riot act and so the first step it 's the one where the lawyer comes and talks to you so the first the first step is obviously the council needs to have a set of standing orders you 'll all have watched previous councils you 'll no doubt of listen to and watch Parliament Parliament has a set of standing orders that controls the debate that you have and councils have to model set of standing orders and most councils adopt them with the odd change here and there previous council had adopted the standard set of order standing orders with a couple of amendments and what we are proposing to you today is to just adopt those again and but there 's a chain and that has been enacted by the recent changes to the local government act particularly in the area of giving the mayor who worship certain direct pass normally what would happen is that the standards New Zealand standards would have updated the model standing orders but they haven 't managed to do that yet so councils around the country and have cribbed on each other and we put forward a set of proposals that incorporate his worships special powers into the Standing Orders and valid are listed there we anticipate that New Zealand standards will produce some amendments themselves in due course and at that stage we anticipate bringing the Standing Orders back to you for a further review so I won 't take you through unless you want to take you through the precise details of many Christians counselors yeah so buddy welcome you me and I know you 'll be leading it as a first-time council I do have some problems with some of the wording and the Standing Orders and I take on board what 's been said that eventually we 'll have a real renew a lot of standing orders but at this stage we don 't know when that will be so there 's a couple of years I just like to raise a bit sir but mr. love yourself you wish you could we go to the order paper that you discussing on page two at the bottom background you will see clause two point four point three this is the omnia gender paper happily areas their work discusses whether we have an equal council or an odd council there 's a numbers I just raise a question in regards of what has appeared on the order paper clause 2.43 but affect the indicative document which is the capo districts standing orders as they are at the moment quotes in regards of a majority of members if the number of members work out is one lot of saying that if you have a quorum of a quorum of a quorum seven persons a quorum of a committee is three may I believe what stated in the other document it actually States it would be more than but just need some clarification on it through through you your worship and the the model standing orders as councillor bodies has pointed out and have essentially if you 've got an a neat and even number you go up when what our behalf have set it down a half the previous council as we 've referred to had voted to change that so going down a half said of upper half and obviously this council today can decide whether to retain what the previous council had resolved or to revert back to the the model would be if the previous council passed this would that not be on this document you go to their standing orders as exists today I think so you 're referring to the to the draft that we the separate the separate document the draft this was printed out from the standard document if you like those amendments had been attached and on by stick in if you like so they didn 't show up on this on this on this document wind was printed should be they should they should be in there but but they didn 't they didn 't come out on the printed on the protein come up on the printed document okay so how do we get free that one well you were you worship and there is the resolution if the council wishes to retain two point four point three as the previous councils head and we just need to amend the the resolution to include that number one at the top of background if the council wishes to revert back to the model and then that doesn 't need to go in asking here today as the council happy to continue on with the previous yes cancel have guessed that that 's the question so will we be moving a amended resolution near to dating well you worship at it it depends whether the if the counter wishes to carry on with the to to the resolution to add that in what are we adding in bedding and what the previous previous resolution was moved by council has been must have anymore as I see it as I see it so it needs to be added to this Soviet suggested amendment to the resolution so you worship if that was to take place the the words that are under in the heading background to the paper the words under number one end and the same applies to with a number to those those are both what the previous council had but aren 't part of the model and so it would be simple to amend the resolution to add those changes in as well okay so I suggest a new number three then it would it would actually be am as7 a 10 17 17 9 18 I 'm accounting my Romans Romans quickly this includes previously wishes it is actually in the suggested resolution so ya see what it just hasn 't spelt that have necessarily hasn 't let go come out if you love a castle body would you like me we can probably its decision is whether we accept what a previous council is done or secondly we go back to what its effect on these Danny orders which is my preferred option okay so what 's the feeling of the council here are you happy that the previous councils made the correct decision mean that being the committee quorum of any meeting short consists of half the members of the number of half the members of the number is even when lesser number of members of the number of azad for example the quorum a seven-person committee is three sort of pity semantics here that we need to just yep previous counsel made that decision and previous counselors here that were on that he was trying him did was any issues with those epic i think I 'd like to move but I 'm happy to put that in the resolution just to clarify that former council body and that committee is at the moment bearing in mind there is a new standing orders coming out you worship just to clarify as I understand the way that 's worded to committees it talks about committees as opposed to the council as a whole what then is the council 's position adoption of what was passed last general flavor here yeah yeah in mind that there was a new seed esteem them all this camel I can show you your worship if we adopt the previous standing orders until the new document takes a fake surely that would be the correct procedure presence going so you 've got Standing Orders you go yeah Nev any meetings so um it 's been I 'd like to move it would never mean literally I 'll second that you 're my couch the crate all those in favor please say aye we should it seemed to be discussion on the motion if you want discussion on the motion that 's that 's fine it 's been moved and seconded one of the reasons your honor that I raised these points that we have at a stage where we need if you like the Bible which is your standing orders there are some i believe discrepancies in it and there is no indication yet us some of the various points that we 're getting you to raise now may well be in them so not quite sure sir when I stupid i do agree view council body that central government and you would have thought they knew the time of getting these standing orders out and either set the date quite a long time ago or they would have done it by now but so i appreciate where you 're coming from okay any other comments we moved and seconded have I as a favor for sale as against good right they recorded to cancel buddy certainly okay item number five get you again rock she 's sorry David yes sir I just had one it 's just a clarification rather than and looking at anything else on the resolution for item number four we talked about on the first point I just need to clarify whether we 're talking about three point 12.1 which is as per the resolution or in the reading notes that refers to the clause three point 14.1 can we just clarify which one we 're talking about because was an error in the in the reading document it talks about the council making some changes to the standing order and refers to clause 3.1 4.1 but in the resolutions that we 're passing it refers to the clause three point 12 I suspect us just oh but i just want it to be honored sir john is a fifo from from in blood patina to be pudding yes it 's a it 's a typo true before then okay alright thanks item number five this year again it is you worship one of the requirements of the first the local government act has respect to the first meeting of the council after an election is that the members must be made aware of certain pieces of legislation and so the report talks through those not only touch on them briefly and then answer it answer answer questions if there are any so this is really just for your information it 's a formal requirement of this meeting obviously the Bible is the local government act 2002 I won 't confuse you with the confusion that the local government to talk about that at some stages but you 're you 're guiding document is the local government act 2002 and as we 've set out there that sets out section 10 sets out the purpose that 's why we are all here and and as we all know the purpose of local government has changed in the last 12 or 18 months so there 's a new council you 'll have a slightly different focus than everybody else but that 's your touchstone section 10 is what you need to go back to whenever you make decisions obviously what officers will try and do is bring reports to you that focus on those issues and what that also goes on to say about the local government actors is the role of council laws your role is essentially what is commonly known as governance you make the big policy decisions chief executive puts them in place and and the paper lists a number of things that that we do the second big piece of legislation that you deal with us what 's commonly called legume er local government official information is particularly picky about the way they named X because this covers two bits one it governs your your meetings it doesn 't govern the way you run your meetings because that 's standing orders it governs the way you call meetings the council calls meetings and how that interacts with the public but the second one which many of you will be familiar with is it 's the local government version of what 's what central government has the official information egg and some people even will refer to it as the official information act even though that one only plays the same central government and its main principle is that public authorities operate in public and most information that the council has that you receive will be public information that people can apply for there are some exceptions to that rule and are listed in the act and they mainly deal with what you 're all what everybody would understand is being sensible the council 's doing a three million dollar deal to buy sell some land you can understand that it 's not a good idea to person to say that in public then they 'll know what your strategy is so reasonably sensitive sensible but they can be somewhat controversial and the local government official informational meetings act lagrima sets out a process where information can be sought by people that goes through an internal process and ultimately gets ruled on by the Ombudsman but I think from a council or point of view and what you need to remember is that the general rule is that everything you do is and should be done in public and next one local authority members interests act this is one that can end up with a counselor not being a counselor anymore so the first rule is about pecuniary interest and there 's two aspect to that one is if if you or somebody associated with you has a contract with the council that involves more than 25,000 dollars in any one year primer facie you are you can 't_''_1228.88 be involved in that contract however the system recognizes that that is not uncommon and the office of the auditor general has the ability to grant exemptions and about if it did happen that an organization that any counselor was associated with ended up bidding for a contract or getting a contract with the council there are processes to have that approved by when by wellington but it is something you need to keep an eye on an example of how far reaches when in Whanganui for instance a counselor was married to a person who was retired from the family contracting business but still had one share in the family contracting company that person was caught by this council is caught by this legislation they just need to think about that if any body associated with you might be contracting with the council and the next the next level of pecuniary interest isn 't contracting with the council it 's you might be affected in a particular way by a decision you might have might be better or worse off by decision now went into the scale simply being a ratepayer doesn 't mean you can 't vote on the rates because the rates will affect you your pocket but it does mean if you feel like of the house next door to you or the council 's going to buy the house next door to you will put a Vodafone tower out in front of your property you might need to think that you 've got a it might affect your house value therefore you 've got a peculiar interest and now wonderful for lawyers because the lines are as blurred as they can be it 's as long as a piece of string but the advice that we give you is just keep an eye on it you 'll be getting a booklet and some more training on it guidance from the office of the auditor general just think about it when when things are happening and if in doubt seek advice your own personal lawyers for instance should be able to help them on the line and you can talk to the chief executive although he and i can 't give you advice about it but we can potentially point you in a direction and the last one is non-pecuniary interest and that 's what commonly known as bias and so as a law the test being of the common man was the man on the Clapham omnibus man on the man on the on the bus in from acacia Bay what would he think she think about and a decision could they think that you might have already decided what was going on or you might be influenced by some external force the only way that gets tested ultimately as if that last one is if somebody takes a judicial review of the council 's decision but again that one something you need to think about but is again very difficult sometimes to draw the line but feel free to feel free to ask these next ones are the real riot act crimes act you can commit a crime and go to jail which will naturally or potentially lead to you no longer wing a counselor and those things are really about bribery and corruption accepting gifts for the purposes of making decisions taking a backhander the secret commissions act 1910 is really much the same thing it 's involved in somebody giving you a reward to vote in a certain way and you know tell your mates to make a killing the Securities Act and security markets Act apply to the council when the council borrows money theoretically if we put out a directly put out a prospectus that those rules apply exactly to us as they do to South Canterbury finance or anybody else raising money as this paper says generally councils don 't do that this council doesn 't so this that one 's unlikely to end on you and the last one is the protected disclosures Act whistle whistle blower legislation there 's a process for whistleblowing which means that an employee of the council can go through a process where they believe something bad is happening same thing applies to the counselors and essentially what that whistleblower legislation says you can 't_''_1606.91 be disciplined properly raising an issue and the last bit of the right act is that generally nobody can extract money out of your pockets for bad decisions of the council CEO can go to jail but you guys generally are protected the CEOs generally protected a proper decision to make there is a power for I 'm so bored if the council and lawfully make some decisions now and lawfully in that context doesn 't mean that a judicial review says that the council should have processed something differently what it means is that the council deliberately unlawfully does something they know the answers a but do be and there is consequently a loss of loss of money to the council and as you see if if you vote against that r is that unlawful resolution you 're off the hook for instance I have to say that i do not know of any instance in the last hundred years that councils have had the surcharge imposed on them it 's not I think there was a situation in eighteen something or other the early nineteen hundreds where did it but it 's not a it 's a big risk if it happens obviously council staff as a million dollar loss you might have their money taking directly area pockets but it 's not realistically a risky and of course if you go back to the touchstone and follow the local government act not likely riot act I 've been considered I consider yourself all told I 'm happy to take questions yeah any questions for Miss gostrey yeah somebody in the start of the document is mention of the of our code of conduct now I believe that yet says somewhere that can take six months as it not when the new council comes in for a code of conduct to be produced so that 's what we 've just had on that vote before I believe as a council we can alter standing orders to see what we want are we bound by this code until another one comes out and we sign it where do we stand as I understand it the code of conduct carries on for that period until you till you change it well the reason I raised it the kind of contact that we 're under then at the moment also contained section 10 which is being altered in the new Act so are we abided by are we we subject to Watson here or that new section team you wish a Pepsi can answer it and answer so it doesn 't apply to the council what what the code of conduct is about is relationships between councillors it can only apply to use the generic term bad behavior counselor to counselor as opposed to anything else so while the reference to the old section 10 is wrong the new section 10 applies the rest of the code which defines what happens if somebody believes and other councillors badly will still serve you well in the meantime it is it is obviously something that as officers we will want to get something up to you as quickly as possible okay any other questions like I suggested resolution there that the report legislative advice to the incoming council be received if I counselor being seconded by Councillor pack all those in favor please say aye those against Kerry thank you item number 6 and just the next meeting our the first meeting is that pretty simple there the first meeting will be take place on the November the 12th at 1pm could I have a louver any questions about their you wish it and I just an excuse me was going to raise it on those standing orders but because this items on gear and my concern is that we 've only got three cancel meetings i know we 've got training sessions but actual council meetings up until the night the December twelfth December or something if only three council meetings in this fight in this in this year and next meetings will be right through februari there was items raised in the community during the elections but I think needs to be addressed at least perhaps one of those items and we all know what those items were cv and land value the best upon tongariro street and the car park at two photostream I 'm not saying as as these items can be dealt with but I do think that the items need to be on a very early agenda at least one of those items to restart the debate and my concern is that meeting so we 've only got those two or three meetings before the new the new year so could we have some I have some assurance that one or two or the novemb ater in november or december or there 'll be workshops on them you wish it so you think you can select reading our soon to be here meet with all the senior managers pertaining to those issues and they will be dealt with as quickly as possible and we just workshop them first so people have a full understanding of all those issues the implications and complications with them and as a matter of urgency but i would suggest possibly it won 't be till februari and the februari match but they do it is a priority and and absolutely stress that with them possible there could be web shops on some of those issues before prior to christmas but probably the actual matters will be dealt with every match next year my break was the CEO is this correct sir i think it 's fair to say that some of the issues or one of the issues in particular would be more of a long-term plan type of issue but we do need to get out there and start talking about the issue so it has been speak I would sincerely hope that we could have some workshops before februari mom is alysha and the issues were as you say very topical and let 's get in and deal to them yep you wish '_''_2086.25 port but cancer had clean the same effectively continue with our debate on Standing Orders was an issue that i was going to raise can you explain to me please the procedure for a workshop do we have to have a meeting that then says we will have a workshop or did someone just decide there will be a workshop the meeting on the twelfth of next month in documentation described as a council meeting but the advancement and the paper said it was an extraordinary meeting trying to work out if there 's a difference between the two they can you just take us through what needs to be done for a workshop on a particular issue because the points that cancer it can raise a very very valid at this time extraordinary meeting is because an extraordinary Audrey meeting yeah okay and workshops will take place as is required for to the meeting and it 's an arrow through a council meeting decide to have a workshop I mean there 's two two parts to that process if there if councillors decide that there needs to be a workshop on a particular issue generally speaking that would be at a council meeting because at each council meeting we we look at the following months meetings and any workshops that go around those and the counselors can decide at that particular time let 's add in a workshop about a particular topic so that 's one way of advancing a workshop another way of advancing your workshop is if there is a particular issue that needs to be workshop by councillors in advance of a meeting then the staff will will call for a workshop and will there be approved by by the counselors to get to get that information to councils so staff can promote a workshop but also the counselors can promote a okay suggested resolution the other at the first meeting by district council be held 1 p.m. tuesday the 12th november two thousand thirteen could I have in favor please say aye those against Gary okay cook the air so realize cup of tea coming up but just adjust at the finish off I 'd just like to wash all the young thank you to the public in friends and relations and cousins and a diesel coming today and lover in laws and whatever you so very nice to see you all here we have a cup of tea and refreshments I just like to wish all my fellow councillors you know well and congratulations again this council we won that I hope works together the district and please remember to be courteous to each other at all times and respect each other remember if you want things to change you 've got to get some people alongside you you 've got to get people to like your first you know so just remember remember that and things will change now you must get the support of your fellow councillors good luck and let 's go for it cup of tea time thank you _"

    "text": "yeah mom talk to me I me so very very very freely the water does the basically the item is to adopt the annual report and at the annual report any annual son in that summary in rural poor to be approved for release to the public so as you 've received in the agenda we have received and on unmodified opinion from ordered new zealand so clean bill of health is you mentioned earlier and so what we 've done is we 've just in the documentation we 've given you we 've just put the the additional disclosure notes in that was required from order new zealand and then there is and that was around the item that was brought to the previous council and then there 's a couple of other pieces of paperwork that go with it that I 'll just hand over to Jeanette to explain what they are you so dare any report at the last council meeting it you received and there have been a few tweaks to that and which don 't affect it in any materiality at all however the resulting annual report for the year we 've received at sunset meetings I 've just included the part that is included in the annual report now relating to them and and it 's behind that note from that for the LTP and ending it behind it I 've just attached an unsigned copy of the audit report on the full angle and you 've received on your table and one for the semi-annual report as well just so that you 've got all the documentation in terms of the 17 million on the the deep books are the LTP forecasts we had forecasted that it would be 180 180 million is at 30 June this year and due to the some of the decisions that were made we managed to come in at you say 163 million which is the 17 million below in terms of the absolute details of all of those you put me on the spot here I don 't have all of that at my fingertips um yep yeah so so so sorry I was just going to liberate a little bit on that the as your the land sales program is going to be get been going very well so it 's the active management of the of the assets of the district terms of that we 've managed to generate the cash flows to reduce the debt oh right for all right for yep yeah yes absolutely significant savings on the interest cost interest further Thank You counsel and just further on that raging they can send an impulsive indicated that if we stay on the trajectory that they where we are with terms to our one the financial restructure that this council put in place that they anticipate that they 'll upgrade that a notch to double-a within two years and that 's as a result of the decisions that this council made big city councilors and i think that 's that 's a good rate in to be in that those classes of counselors yeah well i 'm not a big guy i 'm patting myself on the shoulder but i do want to Pat you guys on your shoulders and senior staff that spinner it 's been an arduous journey but you so well done good luck and as I said before I just challenged the next council it 's going to come in and work with yours that they carry on that path and and and achieve better at least what we 've achieved if not better so there 's a challenge for them anybody else counsel crate and you just turn your speakers on off yeah I didn 't even share my own on my apologies the fact is as you said mirek that we 've through paid a lot of debt off just things look very promising for the future mr. Ward you know in the next council are they right now we 've cleared a lot of the stuff is this lightly to project through to a easier year where we haven 't got to pay for ETA s and AC bars and yahoo street hope not i think the key thing from i think the key thing from me as your finance manager is that you 've built a very solid foundation you made some very difficult decisions and you 've built a very solid foundation for that actively managed and we have a strategy in a program going forward so yeah I think that the tough decisions have been made the solid platform has been built so looking forward it is a strong balance sheet and down then the prospects for the future look good and there 's no not nothing when I look down this list on page 13 of what we have done this year is nothing like as big as some of those that are going to turn up next year hopefully at the this mean and obviously significant investment and infrastructure over recent years which has put the the district 's infrastructure in tip-top shape shall we say and there 's certainly nothing now projections of significant produce going going forward so the the the condition of the the essential assets to the district in a very good shape I think also I 'd like to answer that part of the answer counselor quotes questionnaire to two parts to it I think the question is answered when you listen very carefully to what you said before Standard Poor 's will give us the track that this camp will go on at the moment you can 't get a better credit rating than that that 's the kudos that 's the big boss giving it the big dick I just want also comment on cost of this councils and could whoo-hoo Street was voluntarily done AC buzz was involuntary done the five million dollar sewage spill down by lane cove Danny involuntary so you 're not you know I just need to keep that separated because I support st. doing whoohoo street and I 'm proud about look buddy lovely we did that voluntarily but the other ones are involuntary so you don 't know what to rent a corner when you have sewage pipes breakin and an extra Mendes heading towards the lake it separate deeper so yeah there 's just needs to be qualified there because the next council could could run into dramas like that and we ran into that one two years ago rob just before I think we 're just before I 'm men or something a man just had to take the bull by the horns and and I don 't want to be too critical on either governance or management of the past but what a diabolical miss well hopefully we 've got it right and ability will be thankful for there 's nothing further I just make a point to you worship because then they 'll just just mentioned it on page five of the annual summary report we have 1.2 billion in assets including land in full spectrum buildings I know all those assets can 't_''_712.2 be sold but it is still 1.2 billion dollars worth of assets in this council and if you your maths and I 've said it before we have around about a ten to twelve percent debt ratio and anybody with any concerns out there if they only owed ten or twelve percent of their houses value on the house I 'd say they 'll be pretty fortunate and pretty lucky so if you weigh it up like that you know 10 or 12 in debt ratio against the st face there 's pretty good in my opinion because that asset base didn 't get there just boy someone is and well done as far as I 'm concerned maybe not put some other people but being at the coalface I think all of us around this table know what we 're talking about so good luck to you all for Saturday and I sincerely mean that because you should all be staying here in my opinion so rough there 's a suggested Lucien could I have a move on a second a piece move comes to Johnson ticketed deputy mayor ya know all those in favor say aye I carried thank you very very much and I will officially close the meeting at for the last one at 1042 and I would like to ask you if you wouldn 't mind hanging around a little while if we can get Lori here we 've got a little gift to give here after here 12 years of sterling service to the district thank you thank you thank you _"

okay this item is a continuation of items that we 've been bringing over the last sort of four or five years we were trying to ensure that all of councils policies are up-to-date inconsistent so what we have done is we have gone through up to certain point in time and we 'll be continuing this process as we go forward and i have attached an appendix of have been superseded by legislation where things such as our in your report or the TDC delegations menu which was a doctor in june 2012 and so I wanted to know if there was any particular questions anybody hit on any other policies otherwise we can move resolution you 've got the lists as attached and the reasons for the revocation does anybody have any particular question to any of the policies so it 's your mother cleansing the cupboard

discussion and head in those workshops on I should have brought it up with new rules here but is there a procedure that we have to change the policy so you don 't need change policy just recreate became a priest thank you so would have been better workshop I thought tongue and would your doc those at your monthly meeting yes i did for Ricky but it 's still good to have minutes so you can go

Carroll slide says oh you 've changed the rules do that with consultation to the public come on me this is very much about which is just making it very explicit that we revoking not going to do so and local government there from the other element that I just wanted to clarify those who weren 't involved in the hearing process when we went out for consultation we talked about spa thermal park being included in the liquor ban area we received very few that we received three submissions on that point to oppose them 14 so the decision was made through that hearing process not to proceed with Spartan will Park in Daniel so it 's this really best substantial change for the hearing process the other minor tweaks that track change versions we 're really just about clarifying a few matters and fixing up some minor amines Woodsmith Ian okay come to innocent question about the dog controlled by law um if I understand there 's a fundamental change there which will essentially mean now that it 's an offense not to have a dog on leash in any area in the district which is not a designated off leash exercise area is that correct what we have we haven 't_''_638.31 changed that situation through the bylaw all we 've done is made it much clearer we had a number of clauses that set in the old by law and when they refer to a number of different schedules and it was somewhat convoluted if you try to work your way through the Bible so that situation hasn 't changed we 've done is made it clear there 's only one area though let 's unleash doesn 't you will see drew Murray Walker 's all the areas is only one year of us at least yeah what about the doctor and a five mile back in this second Q which identify the dog exercise areas where they 're not required to be on leash and the reschedule talks about prohibited areas but Bay there 's quite a few but in general hi public areas yes dog basically have to be on a leash everywhere over question so in that case theoretically if you 're walking a dog down the beach I Tony say it was off the leash would you be in breach to the Bible I believe you would be it was in a public place and it wasn 't identified in the second she jus bein brooch other by law for it thank you well seeing I shouldn 't piss on a room I 'll just play the devil dead cook but for a minute all the properties of way to do it got riparian right so how you 're going to tell people on private property that they gonna be kind of the dog on a leash they must have the dog on a leash like that we knew it that was a curly one not worth it but that 's how silly laws can at wait a minute now why he knew his all why Furion writes all the properties ever feeling right before we have judges and lawyers so who wants to move and second these amended demanded to get to resolution for these booths I 'll move it is he gonna come on let us Higgins good be come to Tremont all those in favor your honor oak just like to record my vote against the dog bylaws oh cool thing I 'm sorry I should have asked for against against counselor Henderson and recorded yeah oh you 'll have to vote again till four there right sure I didn 't vote I didn 't put them up here for at least technically that 's what I had go back and put them up shipping me which one no it 's fine um just like it recorded that my concern is with the dog bylaws and not the other medicine okay okay number 21 deputies to council submission on the proposed national monitoring system for the results punishment x oh we got you again mr. Carroll this my lucky day very quickly is looking at how it clicks information I 'm particularly around the implementation and Resource Management Act you 'll be aware that are going through a myriad of changes in relation to that legislation they 've received some feedback that some some of those changes are necessarily backed by robust analysis of what the actual problem was as a result they 've identified a need to collect better and more consistent information so they 're developing a national monitoring system which is essentially targeted the resource management net we 've put in the submission raising some concerns around potential costs to counsel when um a significant number of local authorities and try and standardize their way they do things that obviously has a cost implication if you say at the stage the detail in the proposal is skint and that makes the estimation of those costs difficult it 's only a point that we felt was worth making today just a resolution air that we approve the submission on the proposed national monitoring system for the rewards Management Act 1991 anybody want to move that we 've come to Truman probably fall it will find it 'll fall on deaf ears okay what do we got left and we 're counting engagements up till the up until d-day sharply airport committee on Monday the seventh Council Johnson myself and that 's about it we may if must have been here it can get the auditor-general sign off before then a call at SPO to do that boo job I don 't think anybody 's going to want to go for any conferences in the next two weeks I shouldn 't want to figure right better pay for it if it were so so we have to we have to not on here those that and we have to we also have to authorize whoever the new mirrors to go to me as school on Wellington that we 17 Thursday the seventeenth and eighteenth of October must say I enjoyed it with Bob Bob Harvey that year was a very enjoyable bottle of whiskey so I 'm please move move comes a cook take a good counter down out all those in favor say aye all right that includes that day I 'll start this I 'd be on the table cancer hinders if you want to do it today or mistakes members reports miss Jake does it but you did do it once the other week so it 's where you might wanna know if there 's any particular items of interest and regards to meetings that I 've attended I think with bring up I bring them up if not as usual as Jake 's has my diary available week view of is Jake 's counted on some ten of these own to meeting very informative fest where local government and the advocacy they do wiper my or a house board meeting and as discussed earlier attending a meeting with your new zealand the betterment of the airport like cancer Johnston designed to conference over two days citizenship ceremony and opening of the sports advisory councils view offices at total youth employment steering group committee and billions year and then also that 's great to be a part of their site position facing I think I 'd be for the treatment practica come back to council because he 's at the preference conference there right yes council hoechlin I 'm trying no I skipped on coming back to that so you can okay p IQ and further so that 's right i think this fine he 's fine um i attended the last meeting of the Regional Transport Committee of a beginning of a month I also attended law Reba debts farewell at the yacht club 2022 fonia tier lake taupo protection I went to design to meeting and so did Larry here tell me yeah am the total hung a citizen sports association meeting and in on Sunday we had a visit from nurse nikki kaye and Louise abston and exciting news for Mikey know they 're launching a new youth program and called year switches youth and emergency services and it 's going to be for youth aged between 16 and 19 and they going to get involved in the local in Valencia st. John 's fire brigade and gaining those skills in hopefully become a volunteer base those emergency services so we had some youth from book to lure that came over and talked about the 's a really excited about it they gained a lot of skills a lot of confidence so yeah so we 're lucky enough to have that hip and boost them on you cannot we come to give up yeah i mean to owing to as well but I don 't think there was anything significant that came out of dainty if anything that was really going to affect things in the future so you went to Louise up Stan 's office with a group of consumers who are still carrying on the fight against the lines company charges or the methodology they use for those charges you recall repay who had a user group which I was appointed by the board to attend that group hasn 't set for a long time there have been changes within the management or TLC or the lines company the new CEO is in fact was one of the members of the group so things have kind of fallen apart and that respect but the reason undertaken to for the user group the resident group to take up he consented enough fat on sealers the youth awards and in the rogue our joint agreement signing a deal with five other Mears around the surrounding districts of the riddle gentle download somebody moves at those women I 'm sure I 've got to come back so i skipped yeah they 're a year okay sorry counselor great most of the ones that everyone else mentioned but i was privileged to chair the yes awards judging panel I went to the youth awards last week last weekend I also thanks to you people went to the safety and efficiency conferenced put on by trappings if I can just be indulged you just a few key points that I 've put out promise I won 't go on too long the attendance was about two hundred fifty percent of them were police the conference was over three days and sadly i miss one day cuz i was sick good news and bad news out of the conference first of all the road casualty figure or this coming this current year could be the lowest ever 15 years ago we had 800 people odd people killed 500 800 'd people killed on the roads this year we could be under 300 killed on the roads now what how did this come about this decline first of all we 've got stronger bigger cars with airbag a bag so a lot of people that would have died was saved by the construction of their car education a lot of education has gone into the last 15 years signage the safety journey the safe journeys policy Friedrich actions and laws you know the licensing laws when kids and the speed restrictions that we put on in the district that 's written the head-ons have been reduced by a in a lot of cases by I mentioned it like this time last year wire rope barriers and one of the things that came up in the conference 's wish we had put the wire rope barriers in UTA because it would have solved three lives and probably a few more accidents because they may avoid head-ons they don 't go up they can 't get over this wire rope it 's like that because but the only sad thing was that Sweden Sweden 's a model for Road Safety they 've got the policy of zero deaths on their road for this year now that is incredible and they 've got all the latest policies in place to carry it out Queensland is interesting a psychologist came from their doctor fliter and said that the psychology of driving is just as much important as everything else what people can take in when they 're seeing how people react all the gadgets on their car so that was an interesting one Peter Khoury gust of opus talked about walking as a safe mode of transport and that was interesting so with well that I found the most interest or an interesting one was Glenn curry dr. Glenn curry from Christchurch University talked about the cycling de cycling sort of revolution that 's going on if you 'll excuse the pun and how all over the world he had examples of cities that have transformed and prevented gridlock by getting more cycle lanes in and he it was impacting just give you an example in London where this man came from many years London in the city roads of London are cycles so they 've just gone crazy on cycling there Harry Wilson when the nzta was another interesting one he gave a ESO y quedo recently I got it right Dennis like every region or officer we 've got in our district we 've got the heaviest road use and we 've got the most accidents and we 've got the worst Road I think Barry it comes under your attitude he 's talking about reducing the road transport you know that the number of vehicles by having be trains with nine axles in the future and it 's interesting to know that inside ta also covers whale transport and we 're one of the only district in the whole of New Zealand that 's got nowhere way service in our whole district and it 's all to do with moving stuff to the port of course of tow honor and the inland port of what 's it called Crawford Street in Hamilton yes Karen hey from Auckland talked on the high risk were roads and we 've got a lot of for letting me go to this ad far more to it than that lots of information and any questions nehru perhaps I could expand there was that something else ain 't too Harry Wilson was one of the speakers and he spoke about the H trucks that 's the high volume trucks and the changing of the configurations of the of the axles now I have a family member in the trucking industry and he tells me because of the road users cha cha changed right whereas if you have a 55 ton truck now and you 're only carrying 10 ton you still have to pay for a 55-ton sticker previously you only paid for 10 times thicker the effect of that is these truckee firms are coming in and asking them to change the axles and alter the steering tandem stairs or the rear axles the effect of that is I see it every day traveling up when I travel up from too tangy is when the truck is staring out over the center line are in a left-hand bend the back end of the truck is crossing if you 're a cyclist and the truck front end goes past you got to be worried about the back in so our roads may not really be meeting the standard for the safety standards for the new changes I 'm sorry but I mean most people know my opinion about all this but it was the last government that race tracks from 44 tons to 53 and it was a certain XMP it took me to task and did they weren 't linkedin there weren 't going to be any bigger well they 're two meters longer they 've gone from 44 tons to 53 and for enjoyment I ride a motorbike alot and i can tell you now the streets the roads in this district are falling to bits very very fast and now they make more stupid rules but hey you know read the signs look what 's behind yet says that sign over there I 'm going why I 'm trying to go this way crazy so there you go so nothing further from their members reports be received mover please move comes to Johnson second am going to have to exclude the public and this is a procedural better to do a confidential item then I 'll be opening it back up it should only take a couple of minutes if you want to come back in for agenda item 16 and 17 you 're welcome to yeah and if you we come back on the 16 and 17 you 're welcome to but I have to deal with this issue before we can deal with those two agenda items _"

with that as a if I pay 5 grand fix that pipe a nice tender builds the broadband meant if I really good effectively that 's that 's a no cost and in terms of the budget yes but in terms of the contract price council awarded a contract price so why doing this additional unforeseen work comes against that contract price how much of that 900,000 we actually get back how much of the striking happens English mine was about a hundred thousand circumspect winded these strikes come here has it only happened the last few months was noted right through a period of the contrary so you saying the contractor was absorbing to a point where you couldn 't absorb him anymore no we still Fenian bills no no the absorbing that the extra costs until we got to the point where he 's through the cheer we 're required to treat everything on a gross basis so therefore we have to treat the costs of the payments to foot and Hogan for the three water 's contract separate to any recoveries that for accounting purposes separate to the actual cost of the contract so if for example chorus or some of that nature had a caused a million dollars problem that would have been a million dollar increase in the cost of the contract yes we would have shown somewhere else the recovery of the million dollars but as far as that contract is concerned you would be well in advance of what the original tender price was so what if we have normal problems now for the next ten months do they get this 904 nothing what what I 'm bleeding my questions into why don 't we just fix things as we have to work I don 't see how you can have a contract or whatever you don 't know actually what 's going to happen just 900,000 will allow us to continue providing the level of maintenance that 's currently be provided over the last two years if the money is not required it 's not spent this year Water Tribe station here is not going to acquire any council money for a while is it what a what is contract the three water 's contract as a network maintenance contract so that 's the pipe networks for both water wastewater and stormwater and pump stations for wastewater okay they 've been counted on so you 're saying that this is an insurance policy that we can maintain them for any unforeseen problems in next 10 months but you may not have to spend it we will have to spend some of it you may not have to spend all of them we will only spend what is necessary but it allows you to spin this gives us the ability just look good what y is y FX ok then why is the figure 930 rise it because we have looked back at the last two years worth of work that 's being done and mend it the quantities accordingly and that 's the dollar value that 's come out of it before we use awarded a contract over a period of time for sin amount money and then the context of comeback thing oh we 're running short beneath the last road maintenance contract we have to in the contract and that 's a similar type of contract where you have as usual of quantities where you estimate how many kilometers of road you 're going to be resealing in what type of works are going to be required to do in advance of that plus emergency routes in that instance the estimation of quantities weren 't quite right and we came back to council at about the same time as this one in sorter and increase in the value of the country and once again that was done within the council budgets comes with honored just to put in the nutshell Guinness especially to maintain the level of service of the last two years correct you need this 930 6000 for the next 9 to 10 months Rick 4c to do the same services of us to use 3 just bit the CEO so before i go to counter permanent comes in i just want to provide a bit more clarity around what 's going on here is the count this is basically what you 're hearing is that the staff haven 't got the delegated money that because that comes as a result of work that we 've been doing for a number of years now to understand what work we actually do a lot of this work used to be done in-house and and we never used to record what was actually done so that we were never able to really say with conviction what works physically need to be done to maintain a particular network so it was a instilling an asset management discipline on the organization both in the roading and the waters environment both through our service request systems and under work system so that we in the future we can say we know what work we do on an annual basis we know what the averages of that work are so into the future we are fairly confident in knowing what work to predict that may come up and so what you 're seeing here is the result of part of that work where we 've tried to predict what we did in house we didn 't get it quite right but but in did making those predictions we we this particular contract but it hasn 't changed the budgets it 's it 's it 's not a budgetary issue it 's more about the control and knowledge of our information German bean-counting innocent yes I say am contracts are for a three-year period it seems it must be too long a period like like if we 're prudent should we make period lease if this seems to happen every three years that you have to come back and say well that figures are wrong with the contract no longer as viable again what I would say it 's more about your information than it is about the contract the contract rates of the contract rates they won 't change but it 's the knowledge of the amount of work that 's going to be coming up it would actually help in certain respects to have a contract over a longer period because you 're gaining more information but whether it 's one contractor or another country sure is also slightly irrelevant it 's more about understanding the nature of your work that does occur on an annual basis and that tri-annual triennial information to predict the future more with more certainty because you know the types of issues that are going to occur with your system and as systems get older the demands on the contractors get more because the more pipes break or more blockages occur and it 's about getting a baseline of information to understand what goes on and therefore what 's predict into the future so I would say a three-year contract is appropriate but the initial estimates were were wildly off because you know were wildly off because we just didn 't have enough information from the work that we previously done in-house to know what the future may predict or maybe what may result really hard to swallow though mr. Williams I meant if we 've been doing it for all these years how come we can 't just pack the figures out of previous years and get them right that 's the cab jected to get it right counter unison yeah i just wanted to move motion but also point out that the expenditure from the increase in the contract value will the motion you won 't be moving the motion because it 's really been moved by Councillor download 25 minutes ago so if you 'd like to second it that 's fine I 'll second it thanks there 's any more to org or against the motion before I put a police come to the crepe I 'm just going to ask cutting it down to the chaf this money is out of budget expenditure that we could get some recouped some money from okay maybe a hundred thousand dollars with the strikes we will get that hundred thousand dollars back okay so Elliot add a budget expenditure that we 've got so then remembered you doesn 't change your annual plan or rape forecast or anything like that nothing further all in favor so I moving out to the other favorite topic that the last couple of trade ins has picked up the AC baps mr. Belden afternoon to everyone the report is as read I 'm not very happy to come to counsel with this but unfortunately it appears to be a never ending theme that we find _''_715.07 that we have to be able to manage within the contract there are two parts to the report I 'll deal with part one first the items noted I 've been made aware over the past few months to the working group we meet with every fortnight we 've uncovered additional scope that we really have to attend to none of these are nice to have we have to attend to really in the same vein as the other elements of the refurbishment worker were carrying out I can go through them with you in detail if you wish let 's take it as read but I know that comes with hybrid your agenda yeah fine and perhaps they might like to ask questions that are more pertaining to wear their thinking is my thinking is we need another benefactor like the service family counselor Henderson my questions pretty simple one is any of this work in your opinion um work that we could have foreseen without actually getting into the project and beginning the job no thank you councillor cook what if your dick is also you know do rate that 's if you want to do both the private I was just going to say as part of the Working Committee that goes there I see no other options we 've got to do these things for the safety of the baths you know yellow if required one second resolution air is probably not its own luxury side but the first ones we 've got to do them and I commend Andrew burden for saying that it is a bit embarrassing that we we went right through it and then we found these other mistakes in the whole construction of a suggestion resolution is to approve additional funding thing you 're asking for and budgetary resolutions wrong I was going to get to that but it done budgeted year resolution is incorrect of year but we can get to there it 's not really the issue can 't cycling I just like to make comment on the two of the resolution I think refurbishment of the private pool building is a little bit over a doing it is not quite right because it 's only some facelift it to do is just put a coat of paint just just through the corridor tidy it up the carpet is this down is need to replace him so we 've suggested vinyl and and just to make it look a little bit more presentable like all the other building or all the other improvements we 've done it 's not anything to do with the private pools it 's only the corridos through to the main swimming pool ninety-five thousand dollars i 'd call it refurbishment a coat of paint Danny got night by Grant more than can you answer the question mechanically please well yeah if you 've got if you have another word to describe it other than refurbishment that 's fine I have no problem using it I have described in the report what it what that refurbishment comprises it is more than painting we 're going to put some new lighting in there and new four finishes and repair work basically on either side of this corridor area the private spa poles you will we refurbish in the indoor 25 meter pool which is complete and 't he wasn 't included in the original minimalist scope that was approved under the long-term plan this is just an opportunity to bring this area up to the stand standard of appearance and finish it is purely optional there 's enough to be done got the end that mr. Valin we understand that it 's even on the resolution why we 'll get to that part whether we option two optional and or not but I just wanted to make sure that people understood but it 's not refurbished in the private pools yeah in terms of the posix oh yeah it 's the building that held the corridor yeah well okay true to hear it is an official meeting so counseling is quite correct and what he 's saying were there any other hands up all Christians I 've got a question Williams now due diligence I think and good management correct me if I 'm wrong we 're nine hundred thousand dollars under budget on this water treatment station behind budget money the latest report I had to had somewhere between 88 and 900,000 under budget on ability to take some of that money and put it on another public asset that needs it up there but surely must balance out at the end of the year they surely you saved 900m adventure we must be 600 back and from a total council perspective yes but we do not offer operate slush buckets on this organization well I 'm not suggesting you do i 've read any slush buckets um otherwise i see if i would have found them the other factor too is that expenditure on the water treatment plant is a targeted rate whereas expenditure of this nature comes out a general rates will that targeted rate be dropping nikia cook with 900 k under we will be visiting that when we have the final costs in place but if we are 900 k 0 which is the indication on getting from chief executive officer will the target a break go down there is a possibility that it will go down it 's 900,000 of capex therefore there will be a positive impact on the targeted rate well because I 'm in party with we seen all the work and all the improvements and I would be prepared to move the suggested resolution providing it includes unbudgeted expenditure of item 2 of item1 item2 which is to approve a district but it should be unbudgeted additional funding that 's what you 're moving us and as we 're a second it to that you 're also on the Working Committee and yeah so either your hand and says Chris you are incurred on my project yeah yeah and so was comfortable in full we appointed you guys a subcommittee we trusted you and interview I will follow your lead so cancel Johnson seconder all those in favor say aye I carried thank you thank you mr. belin thank you number 12 who want to talk about tempo campers at the can lock the main anybody oh well so you 're making it like at the heavy task of dealing with this one you want to take it as read counselors and miss Rowley will be able to extrapolate on any points there are there any questions of clarity or anything of Miss Rowley about this 's a lot look great you lovely yeah I do it 's got the full consent of the kind not Community Association you do I like the advisory group out there they they 've got no problems with it at all in case we shouldn 't have any problems should we I 've got an indication with counselor down he wants to move it miss Rowley can I just say one thing that since we 've received this application and this reports come in we 've received another application from the New Zealand motor caravan Association which is a different group for another annual event which is scheduled for May so you know in theory we could get a nun of these applications each year from different groups for different annual events I was staying here I would certainly take the lead from the kinloch or not residents association KCA kinloch Community Association they 're happy with it we know that there 's another group of people around the lake here that are very unhappy about it but the kid locked people are more welcoming and happy with us I counselor I I support it because it 's four to two nights and I think that is the same as what we we have them ferry road and I think it 's consistent with what we 've done previously so I 'm quite comfortable with the fact that it is only for two nights so and a hue talents from repeating can look Association a hundred km behind it so that 's fine it 's their community and the innocent yeah i 'll be voting against it and the reason why is the matter as pointed out by the reporting officer was that once you start the sort of thing you see at a precedent and then it 's very difficult to say no to any future applications okay so um anybody else want to speak against the motion i think the motions been put by councillor down ad seeking the police come to Crate we 've had one speak against the motion does anybody else want to speak against the motion me not I won 't ask you to speak for the motion because you 've indicated where your against is like it recorded go to edison to court a please _"

    "text": "cheers ability to do so my right so questions of mr. Williams please might complicate is nothing specific in here but I just wanting to and ask you about an update on our arrangements with in dt over the ETA are we any closer to a have mr. Lewis in the back of the room so hopefully heard Dennis might be able to enlighten us to where we 're currently up with New Zealand Transport Agency we settled the bridge problem the other day so how many more if we got to get any more head off mr. Lewis I would just like to help comment because of webcam going there 's media etc I would just like to say so everybody understands that the delay and the ETA being officially handed over to us and the lakefront vice versa is all about protecting the ratepayers we 're not going to take on a white elephant we 're not going to take on a road that is substandard to the agreement we 're not going to shortchange the ratepayers of any way shape or form it doesn 't affect the affect them as to the condition when ownership does change in so I don 't post you don 't care mr. lives it takes you another 10 years to make sure that taba District Council stakeholders are not affected by mzd a strong army us okay can you think other there 's nothing further is also my last me I just like to say oh and you can record this that it 's been a very enjoyable six years it 's been great to work with the senior management and tap I District Council I refer to all of them most of my here at the bench today I think you 've been in some very hard times I 'll go on record as saying I believe we inherited a case in many ways shapes or forms we had to bleed a lot and you did a very good job I think mr. Williams it was a very difficult job to do with your restructures etc personally I would like to have left in saying I was able to do something but we have had to been very very prudent recession etc etc we have reduced debts quite considerably most of them inherited the only money we 've spent in the last three years is a water treatment station which central government forced us to build and I concur with it but they forced us to build it and told us we must vote it I forgot to send us a check to build it with so that 's another 30 million we had to borrow but i think all and all the senior management of top or district council can hold their heads high and i thank my fellow councillors for supporting me in supporting them and making sure that we made the right decisions at the right time so thank you very much for that anything what do you want to add anything further on quite happy to open the floor count the kipper yes your worship I just want to support you on that and stuff for the trying times that we 've had we 've heard lots about council debt and so on but you have to understand too that some of those projects like the I 've just come to fruition but just happened to be that council last term that was sitting in the seat so I think congratulations to staff and the CEO for managing it for us thank you so being I 'm sorry Johnson wanted to say that I 'm looking back the decisions made by the past council were all of large infrastructural requirements and I believe this councils the district 's in a great position because we have the water and waste land roading ordered a top-notch condition so we can go forward in the next few years without having to commit large sums of money so I think it 's been a great effort over many years so I think we 're a fantastic position so well done everyone if you come to Johnson as again as I say it 's been a difficult six years so we 've had to make some tough decisions you 've made them hand on heart I support you and I believe in what you 've done and congratulate you in government thank you very much which is my right as the 17 ah two straight after item number 24 for anybody 's information as well when we do go into confidence later on this afternoon we will be emptying everything up that we can so if anybody 's interested all the confidential items of the last triennium that it have no need to stay in confidence will be released when we go into confidence so yep yep you 're quite right mr. green very good deputy CEO what if you are today yeah okay i need a suggested resolution that the chief executive officers report was September 2030 and be received please come to the council cooked comes to Kippur first to move seeking that all those in favor aye thank you so having said that we now move to agenda item _"

Purvis are actually in the room with us Nathan here the down there who I know personally do they want to come forward with you or you happy Danny here okay done in you 've read the agenda item it the the rear of the gender item is the very kind offer made by mutton Heather Purvis as regards probably funding a footpath along farm obey you have provided you with some plans which mr mrs Purvis passed on to myself so hopefully will received a copy that and I 'll try and answer any questions it becomes anything more detailed I might have to refer to button Heather mr ridd I think it 's an extremely generous offer of mr. mrs. Griffith to do this gift this wonderful pass through there there 's a couple of items i think counselors want to bring up one of them was um we talked about it before was um some of us are not that happy with the word bowl ads in presentation it says something about natural planting and we 'll bollards I leave it up to the fellow councillors but me personally I wouldn 't like to see bowl ads at five mile Bay I think it 's very natural place and rocks and trees and things like that but I don 't throw it open to a fellow councillors and see if that what other comments there are pleased complicate am refreshing and effective brief appreciate to have people in the community coming to council something positive for a change and I think I support this in principle completely but I just have some concerns about the consultation that we 've just gone through and they 're differencing in opinion in tow and I 'm not quite sure why the cat offers of today the such a generous offer of the stem by the stem thankful week it 's a huge decision to make when you were such a lot of public interest it 's yet to cricket time period I think the me that I 've I could actually I think about I could actually answer that one and help counselor cook as I 'm wind council money became available it 's always been out in the public that we would be building a path down there when we had the money we don 't have to get to public consultation and I think one of the reasons is just type cycle challenge that want you to run some events out there and if we if we give it the green light today we 'll meet those time frames otherwise we wouldn 't meet the time friends if we lift it to a new council or another month or something like that understand I just on the backend of what we 've just been through publicly just as long as it 's handled appropriately a mix not going to go back on what we 've already let 's call a spade a shovel this this generous offer of the purvis family is not about taking cars off five more bay it 's it 's about building a path where people can walk cycle do what they want but I think the only issue for me as I don 't want to see well I just no place for Bullards in my opinion it 's a natural environment five mile Bay and I think it should sure have a path you know so people could walk and cycle and not trip up Annette but I don 't like ball up that 's i would have to vote for that for this I certainly can 't end this this gracious offer down but if if we just look at page think it 's six of seven you 'll see the placing of the bowl odds are more or less right on where the sort of low planting is on the on the edge of this sort of the beach area and really and truthfully we under there only in certain places where it 's it 's fairly vulnerable from from some of these planets and I would have thought it was it was really good practice to try and stop at least egress on to those that low planting area and so I 've personally have no problems with with the the plans that 's that shown us here today I think I think it 's um it 's been well thought out and yeah I 'm all for it personally okay I can 't look great if you don 't look great I just add to answering councillor cooks queries there you 've got it right your worship but it is some put a a zo event on is also haste because we 've noted that the popularity of this path since we put one in for the mizuno where 2600 people went along it and it joins up with the whole concept that goes back way in history and Joan stolen we 'd just like to get it done before the tourist season begins this year and we 've got in place the next stages of it being constructed it 's going to take 16 days to actually put it in weather provided so that 's one of the other reasons I 'd like to explain you think you 'd come the innocent um thank you to the people who have made this offer firstly from the public I 'd like to support it I think it 's a fantastic plan and the appropriate time I 'd like to move the resolution supporter can 't forgive up thank you your worship thank you to the Purvis family I 've never looked a gift horse in the mouth and turned it down and this is one of those opportunities um ensure and I just like to thank mr. and mrs. Pearce for your kind donation to the Toby will just write me at opal public and and I think we did and discussions when we had public consultation that we kind of talked about that if there was a foot foot path will walk way through there to be a natural barrier and itself so yeah i 'm i 'm happy to support this and from the designs that I 've got it does say native plant in all bollards and they 're only on the shore side to protect it on the areas where the path goes close to the shore so just again night nothing it 's a very generous offer well thank you very much for that I just want to be

fellow councillors are happy I 'd like to see that we 'd take it out thank you um yeah and also team I just like to try somehow if someone can do a little bit of wordsmithing I 'd like to have the resolution changed please um to acknowledge this very generous offer by day mr. mr. pepper or want to be known as the purpose family or so I 'd like the Purvis family included in this resolution

suggestion um yeah I 'll just open up for discussion or for me personally I just think it 's too early as brand new so everybody room knows we had a beautiful listing this morning by ribbon sunny Garland 's way and other representatives from 24 tower the new place over here when it officially does get open and you can go on here you will see what a magnificent job has been done of this it 's got all history of Lake Taupo there it 's got you take your kids need yourself there you 'll learn all about it big the Lakers how mountains got named here rivers happen will sort of things like that so it really is fantastic I just wanted to say that in capital where governance in capital management I think of worked together well to really pull that off and it 's fantastic so opening this up with the first excuse me I so so I just want to focus just watch you quickly through this before is okay yeah okay what I 'm just really quickly sold for a minute was held which was as a result of expressions of interest which went out to the community if you recall then and I didn 't come back and formalize this earlier this is why it 's coming to you now the discussion there was around concession sites in its broader sense the decision the workshop made was around allowing to sculpture sites somewhere on the deck and then the decision around concession other concessions a commercial concessions was delayed until further counsel so the aim of this paper is to primarily agree those sculpture sites but also to put a stake in the Sun to say it 's to concession size either side of the water treatment plant for a future concession should it come along but they will have to come through the council to make a decision and all the infrastructures there so it 's a layer just a thread long necklace lovely just just for clarity this is this is a decision around the allowance of a concession site not the allowance of concessions per se it 's just to allow the project team to get the construct it it 's paper blocks they 've of oxygen player okay come to downward I 'm heavy with a condition a concession area that you 're putting their as your say it 's just for future council to decide whether any concessions go there but just am having the site visit today with the sculpture concessions I feel though that I 'd like to see them in the garden garden area and then they can be covered up with the actual what we have to build there to hold the sculptures we only looking at a meter to two meters to each side and then the bark naturally covers up the features that need to be put in there to hold the sculptures that 's my only too sensitive Emerson a couple of questions if I understand correctly the question here is to spend the money to put the infrastructure in place to allow these things to happen that is yeah right in this Creek so you put the infrastructure their own question i have is can that be done interdependently of the carom work that 's been done do it as part of us as there a cost trade-off between there it 's more cost effective obviously to do now we 've got the guys on site do it there 's allowance within the budget to be able to do this so i would suggest we do it now and then it 's done so the infrastructure that will go and they will allow wide range potentially of activities yeah if there 's I mean yeah you right this power and water in there so anything can happen on there in yeah yep depends what comes comes across our desk or guess yeah thank you he worship certainly after the site visit this morning I 'm same as counselor down odd I would really like to see those sculptures in the gardens first me because we 're where they suggested at the moment the right in front of the seat and whereas the gardens are just like on the right or left hand side of that seats Oh to me just with stretching to see underneath the the plant that 's why I 'm hesitating a little bit thurs planters whether or not there sat on the actual slab so they 'll take wait that 's the only thing I 'm concerned about so that was the idea of having it on the deck was that it would take the weight of a structure other of a sculpture I sexy going into the concrete now now don 't know course there is the planter box is that the planter boxes are made out of steel not sure of the thickness of that steel I mean they 're certainly designed to take the way to the garden and perhaps people running across the top of it but in terms of the point load of a sculptural length not entirely sure but if that 's the suggestion as councils that you want to make we can certainly go back to the designers just double check the the loadings so that you 're not going to affect that steel tray that the plant rocks materials own well we 're a dayglo jacket will end up fixing outlaw be right after innocent we have an estimate on what the retainers we can what you put in there yeah I know I couldn 't at the moment all pack 5 grand 10 grand 50 grand only get by Brent here from the copycat the Kabir animal yeah okay wool I 'm tend to agree with counselor down on counselor heckling and I wonder if the sculpture positioning it should be left to the next council and get some information as to as to with it with a Carol can go because I think they should rise out of the garden rather than take up people space I have to agree with it you 're getting ready to face on me the scope stress have got an offer of a piece which they can borrow which is currently Wellington City an Auckland City one of the two are looking at purchasing is a really cool pace they 've got the offer that being lent to them so they were looking at putting something in fairly quickly so Shahid and we do it and we find out two weeks later that it could have gone yet risen L the garden or three macho and we so let 's just tell mo we discussed this before so are you telling me that two photo have approved us it 's on the way I 'm just hearing so we just rubber-stamping it 's on the way we talked about this before if you if you don 't go down a certain process you ask you for trouble and I think the first process is a sighting of it good situation original oh if we know a strike the pieces of sculpture that is going to arrive we obviously there 's some information regarding my weight or the fixture so surely we should be able to go and do some investigation to see whether we could actually put it in one of the gardens and how 's that that 's a piece of sculpture that we 've got and whether we 've gone through the right process I 'm really not sure but so management obviously know what does bit of sculpture is but we wouldn 't have a click we just governance well you told me it 's on the way you must know what 's on the way not generally generally the counselors not got involved in that in determine the piece of art that 's going there is provided a site that 's always been the philosophy of this council I understand viewed as a technical decision leave it up to people with the expertise maker so um building on council heckling and camps are down out of our support that is can we change this resolution to say that we would prefer if it 's possible to have them mounted in the guard and rather than take up people space based on engineering somebody obviously has to be engineered will fall over could we change the would you support that you got yes definitely okay removing a second most cancer down I 'd seen the council hickling all in favor say aye against jared i just like to demonia the whole thing here this makes agenda item if it 's going to go through i would very much like to be the move of us Carol came through one of the first things I overcame me six years ago she 'd been trying for had proved very difficult at that time however we managed to overcome obstacles at the time and she got a five or six year license obviously because at times next pod so I 'll hand over to you very capable ladies Ellison and I don 't know your friend I 'm sorry Emma Hallie I like not even she 's a new staff member and you 'll be seeing a lot more of Ella because she 's taking over these sort of land management reserve management decisions in report writing and presentations from me so hopefully I 'll be able to spend more time in the office we 'll be seeing more of elephant now on so I 'm I 'll let Ella take over from here let 's go welcome well as Ellison saved my name 's Emma and I 'm the new land management officer and the reserves and I assume that everyone received a copy of the report it was distributed late last week so I 'll take that report as being read and the only thing that I would like to add is that the suggested the assignment documents and fever in your documents I 'd be happy dancing them okay well i 'll go as i said i 'd like to see my want to move it win but any comments and one think it 's a great asset for Talpiot i just hope that if you do build more concession here is that you 're the new counselors mindful of who they allow where they allow them doesn 't affect somebody 's livelihood of business because it is a good bit of business down there and the amount of comments from people that stop and get a cup of coffee as they 're traveling through talk about whatever you and locals to is fantastic so i would like to move the resolution number one and it 's seconded by Councillor down add although sorry are you have to do all three but one two and three and seeking it by Counsell a downer resolution one numbered 1 2 and 3 all those in favor carried okay Thank You Ella welcome

over there idea unfortunately I can 't_''_195.209 be with you today so we 've prepared our destination great lake toples end-of-year report by video as you can see from the report let 's think really tough for tourism and nationwide especially the smaller regions they are quite like toefl region no fear pretty well and that held its own definitely seen a left and another part of summer the summer cps through march especially and with marginal growth in a commercial bid nights and we feed bigger than any of their smaller regions and around the country this last six months the same retain move until then you have premises this continues to provide our collaborative working space that 's management and governance communication and collaboration this concept continues to provide a platform for destination marketing economic development events in a retail sector to work really effectively together where energy has gone into driving cost efficiencies are increasing women watch these three both of that our sites both total internally you can see from the end of your result with our site sales being up twelve percent that energy is really paying off the relocation of the bus stops during the years provided another revenue stream for the top I site which we 're keenly tracking month on month I just like to take this opportunity to thank Tokyo District Council will Samuel an esteem and in particular Karen Bella sorry for this support to drive this project and everyone 's if that 's really ensure that this had a streamlined transition more recently our two year strategic plan has been signed off by the destination great lake tahoe board and currently the action plan that supports their as being implemented this plan will be delivered and stages will ensure we deliver quality visitor services that are cost effective in project has been another piece of work on dgo tease with important schedule and I 'm really happy to report that this project after its initial rationalization is currently in production it 's been a really important project and we really wanted to deliver on this so while we wanted to continue with the former brand of welcoming signs to the waiter we have the opportunity to put in place some engaging and inspiring toes and messages as well we 've worked alongside industry in Tokyo District Council staff again to progress this project resulting and a number of the flu branded science thing we skinned and some new ones being put in place they will in production and will be installed in the next few months rather than running through all of our marketing results over the last six months I saw their color a few key highlights for you first up as an example of one of our special interest focus on stealth we partnered eight operators in the ANZ golf show to produce a full episode of golf in the region the show eat on tv3 in was 1500 it was leveraged by the partner investment in insured we secured advertising value of over fifty thousand dollars the next key marketing highlight was a recent real winter marketing campaign launched second main and the results to date include over 35,000 dollars with a real winter partnered product being sold through our I sites we need 40 participants across the region so from total to Daniel a Papa and National Park participate as partners and this program we also welcomed to larger sponsors on this year and taking a longer term view with our marketing can country telecom in ruapehu alpine lists the kind of quite significant partners for the view to continue with us next winter video content became quite a big component this year for us as well and we reached over 20,000 viewers on YouTube in other distribution channels that we put a video up on the web part results will be distributed to the industry at the conclusion of the activity later on this month trade show season really rounded up this year from april through june d g OT attended all the key this period this resulted and destination great lato for having 151 one-on-one appointments with key travel sellers or corporate buyers our sales calls in a thermal program continue to run alongside the SEC tivity in Surat the year as well I go travel of us as our successful corporate form or program that runs you around a large number of corporate companies that are hosted back in BG Bureau every year convict about conferences currently we live a 56 physique conversion rate of the decabet '_''_485.569 a bit formal program the 56th six percent conversion rate as recorded in the first 12 months and so it 's highly likely that the balance of body fool still remaining welcome back to write book conferences within the region and join we relaunched a strategic steering document that we were fortunate to have over 130 these for this launch this was primarily to provide a platform for the industry to engage with our strategic direction it was received really well and taking a customer-centric approach vocal and other marketing activity we 've got moving forward the main mission going to ensure that we visitors and reflects the papal and animus region in for generations to come we have a number of projects mixed on the agenda for destination great lake toba amongst these are as our digital and web project we have reviewed our current digital platform and strategies and determine their whilst they 're yielding satisfactory results we need to evolve to make the demands of the current and future marketplace the digital environment is now a key point of contact for both sourcing and a delivery of information in the travel and tourism sector in addition to providing information websites now are key facilitator of transactions so the vet in mind our digital strategy is fundamental component for DG 0 2 to achieve its primary objective of attracting more visitors to the region our investment and the online space moving forward is made up of a number of components which are key to allowing the digital platform to be future proofed the 6th generation of development that dijo te are undertaking will provide the means to improve its level of communication to the global marketplace a focus on more content production will be key areas of focus for this coming year research statistics in data will be important also on the agenda for the next year a strong focus this coming year will be in developing a collaborative approach to better analysis in data interpretation the goal really to providing a strong tangible and accurate information that 's measurable and useful not only to us as an organisation but to the local tourism industry also special interest marketing is a new approach along with the delivery of our international domestic and local marketing partnerships this year our change and approach is actually following the National League behind as a New Zealand special interest as focusing and those areas and we 're strong and a good example of this as a bike in hiking by channeling activity to target audiences Regina is stronger brained ultimately produce some more pre-qualified leads and that 's where that approach is going so overall are pleasing result for the region especially when compared to other regions of similar size and location and here 's being tough for tourism over the past few years however it 's a provider of business development and employment and our region the team look DJ téo acutely aware of this and continue to work on improving destination marketing to the end is always everything as a work in progress and the DG OT team continue to work on improving destination marketing programs always and half of the DG otay team I like to express our thanks to the counselors and staff at opal district council who provide us with the resources and the means to deliver successful destination marketing programs thank you thank you Andrew and it was a lovely video presentation thank you very much thank you for getting to TV to work so any questions from fellow councillors council crate probably not a question but well done on your promotion of cycling and walking fishing which came out as a result of our meeting using regular tourism using the Quaker you too phone from now on please judge we didn 't what we did here you but you wouldn 't have been nude on webkit cancelo innocent you end up yes i did thanks to the presentation I 'm sites have been reviewed or under of you and also note that mmm there 's been quite a focus on these over the last two years at least three years actually think about it quite a bit of uncertainty about what the way forward is um I also know that revenue is actually up and then done pretty well so putting all that together i guess the simple question is what 's the plan going forward but in particular a business plan for the I sites I 'm interested in what we might be doing to train the staff and enable them to do better jobs in also in particular what we intend to do with technology and the I sites to make sales more costly yeah so I sites is one of our our critical projects and yes there has been a lot of conversations in the past few years about I sites and about where they sit and what 's the cult from what 's the reason behind them and you know can we make them profitable and all that sort of those very interesting and appropriate questions understand where they fit in the context of dish nation great lake topol we have been undertaking a review of current practice and then we brought in a specialist who as an eyesight specialist to give us an external perspective of what 's going on and what the opportunities are around I sites and that goes through all aspects of business so through the integration of computer systems through permissions and sales in and a whole lot of other SBS in going through this process we had our key question to ourselves is what is the purpose of an eye sight and how how do we relate that to us so we 've sort of come to the conclusion that the I sites to us and if you those for those of you that our AGM you would have seen our discussion around that that the purpose of the I sites for us is to add value to the visitors once they hear in Topal so by adding value we 're investing and adding value to the customers they 're here to get them to spend more to stay more about sixty thousand dollars a year for the total eyesight to run and you know we think that it 's a strong and good investment in our future and our ongoing value to clients and visitors to the region and now we 're looking at ways that we wrap our offering to give that and bring the eyesight 's back into D glt for a long time they 've been pushed out as a separate thing and we 're going to bring the back end and look at our whole service offering to industry and to clients and so to ask your question where we going next is we have started with looking at centralizing systems we are talking about how we are going to integrate with the greater detail tea brand and so we are going to look at how we 're going to manage those resource those those two eyesight 's going forward and reduce costs but also understand that there 's an investment to be made in order to make it work I hope the answer your question I didn 't just walk all the effort sorry 7e you spend about 70,000 on the actual so that was training to upkeep the eyesight so you see that 's going to be around about sixty to seventy thousand ongoing every year um well we that 's current so we have to look at the future plan first to see what 's what the costs are event so that 's just the current cost to us come for the industry sort of answers my question but I think most of what i heard is about cost production and cost control I mean what I 'm actually looking for as much as anything is to see how to grow the business and as the refuse our future and growing the business through those I sites and how do we how do we deliver that so has a new plan being developed about what I sites should do and how they do it or is that still coming no there is still we 're still working on that that 's part of the full review I can recommendations at the end of the review thanks dr. drummer and really talk to like to see going forward as just a bit more collaboration with the GLT in a mannequin or community you 've got the iphone on twitter and you 've got the ice like here so you 've kind of got a team on yeah yeah on the ground in each community monkey dolls yeah kind of not and the loop i think mean like for example the the district visitor signage that came me up it would have been good if they 'd been even just a small focus group or something about what are we trying to achieve you know getting the stakeholders d there and it didn 't really hit them mm-hmm and so we got some beautiful pictures yeah but probably it sort of discussion had happened you know i think we would have loved to have our a new swingbridge omnia so that people could see the waikato river trails where is it was kinda like a bush picture yeah it 's could be beautiful but they 're just things like that so if the communication I appreciate that knob past those comments back onto producer my keen or and talk to some of the local operators and and had some discussion so yes we all know that monkey nor probably hasn 't had the emphasis that it needed but i think there is definitely on the go forward some some motivation to do more yeah and also the balance of you know what imagery we use and and and we have to balance where we think the math what the market will be attracted to as opposed to the local people and we 're that sets oh yeah but i appreciate their we need 10 more conversations yeah just one other question on three bar seven the industry contributions there i think if i read it correctly the goal was 150 thousand and those numbers on the right not to shorter there but i guess do you have any feedback from the industry on why people do and don 't sign up to these partnerships and what the barriers are and what the things are that make me get involved I think that um well from my I can talk about my discussions with people ways that people think first of all people want to support the group so they often do support and that 's why the majority of funding has come through because they want to support the growth of marketing of total in the region secondly they need to assist their current operating cash flows and costs and rationalize those so I think that if you discussed with any of the operators about the level investment and I 'll marketing over the last you know six months they would have probably rationalized quite a few bits of the marking any of the parking so yeah I think it 's just it just demonstrates the industry fluctuations and I think that yeah I don 't think it 's anything more than that I think people have to decide for themselves of what the campaign is relevant to them and obviously they want to be so they don 't think it is further being nothing fear Andrew would you please take my and on behalf of my counsel our congratulations and thanks back to your governance team and to your general manager Vanessa I but I think I creamy of risen to the top and I 'm particularly pleased with what I 've seen from my point of view around the town over these last couple years so I saw my thanks on behalf of all the counselors to your governance team and your general manager of a nester thank you and a copy of that presentation is going on to the website so if you or anyone

sort of a thing like our only defense is that we 're actually we 're engaged in business attraction and development so apologies but we were out there goes in business and thank you very much for giving us an opportunity to come and present you this afternoon great to be here I 'm 2012-13 was a really exciting year for enterprise quite late 204 I guess simply put due to the increased funding we were able to do more there are three sort of carriers which want to quickly mention we were able to develop capacity in the management team and also the governance team which I 'll just talk about in a minute which is basically giving us a strong platform to to continue our work we 've guess what this means is we 're and now in the position to start marketing the region to external businesses as well as our internal customers and in the third area that we 've been very conscious of this year as extending our coverage of our service more fully into to Danny amankeen oh so we actually now have somebody on the ground in manga ki know who these certain is doing an amazing job out there from everything I hear and also down in to dania we 've worked with goat on Valero to give of increased coverage on the ground there now Ann and Brits are going to give you more detail on that I just wanted to very quickly touch on the strength of our governance board now just to update you on some of the new trustees who come on board in the last few months so and I 'll be existing at rustys we 've got Tom Finley is a definite chair currently the chair we 've got Jeff Locke who is to turbo district council representative when link those two left I 'm we specialists killed in a wood processing and governance and anti-glare who obviously have just heard from in a different capacity but she is of extraordinarily health in help in the geothermal area and that 's especially in skill and she also now represents tourism on our board and the new trustees that I just wanted to confirm mention first part Leigh who comes with particular company development entrepreneurial experience and he 's really reinvigorated of thinking their challenges at every step which is always a very healthy process we 've got two new to product our representatives reporter Mary trust board who are amazing trusted in every respect and great deal of intellectual strength amenities comes into them obviously and with that especially around to return the country subsidies so we 've got some rapper Lloyd who 's the CEO of trust board and took me around half is 150 in the both been fantastic we 've got penny Lyons 's just come on which i think is going to be true and i really helpful traction the band we 're gonna get this right leave you with honey is last person i think is Richard Wyatt and I don 't know if you guys come across Richard he 's the CEO of maracas and obviously understands this to the pack as well and he 's definitely bringing a I guess a very strong corporate governance model and is kind of also keeping us on straight Marisa which is huge on bull so I think without further ado I shall pass on to people who actually do work forward so I 'm going to hand over twist nano if he can spit up thanks oh and thank you good afternoon I 'm just going to talk about the top I youth employment steering group very briefly a few months ago we were lucky enough to have dale williams the mirror votre holla come over and talk about the program he 's been running the air and when he came to office he noticed this incredible disconnect between employers and industry that were threatening to pull out about rehana because they couldn 't find skilled stuff indian school leavers were leaving the district also because they couldn 't find jobs and he started talking to industry and they said that they just couldn 't find kids with the right skill set for the job so he said well what are the skills that you need in he got every single NZQA Q&A paper out and put them on the table and he said to all the employers please tick which courses are relevant to your particular industry and from that he got this package and he took it to the poly chicken see can you teach these courses for my young people and they seed no we can 't NEC well that 's fine i 'm going to bring these courses into otra hanger and i 'm going to teach them to our young people in and the 10 years that he 's been running that program and the trade zoom has been up and running these being almost zero unemployment in the crime stats have just gone right down so um a group of us that were at that talk got together and we formed the top our youth employment steer and group and currently it 's made up of social agencies topol District Council and a we and our mission statement is that all young people under 25 and the top or district are engaged in appropriate education training work or positive activities leading to meaningful employment so my role and EGA what our role in ngl TN along with the Chamber of Commerce is to find out what demand side of the equation azonto for and so we want to go out to industry and ask them what the job markets like now what they envisage it looking like in five years time in what the skulls are that our young people need to develop to enable them to move into meaningful employment so what the steering group really needs right now is a champion and I 'm hoping that someone will come out of the woodwork and lead lead it on thank you quick changeover the reason we 've done this we just actually wanted to introduce you to some of the people who are doing some of the work on the ground and one thing I just wanted to talk about today is just briefly where when I started a Thrall almost to the day um we sat in a leaky building where we needed be nice and gloves and winter to work with 150,000 dollar funding to to where we 've gotten to now and it 's for the first time that we feel we have a solid and stable platform and to alluded to that we now have a listen on the ground in Hmong Aquino Lisa she 's doing a great job we 've got a stable platform now and touring you where things are on its way the business mentors are going really strong and we are no up to how many mentors 30 mentor spread across the district from initially six when we started and why not only come in and talk about what we 've done I 'll really now want to use my remaining time to talk a little bit about where we want to go to so we want to carry on what we 've done and especially in a smaller medium business where we 've been and we want to carry this on but one thing in great opportunity or the goal magazine now in the past we just didn 't have any funds to have any attraction for business whatsoever and we 're small and we got a small budget I hope my trustees won 't shoot me for saying this but we feel we have very good funding in place right now we now need to go out and our next phase and attract business to come you and we 're going to focus particularly around about heat users for geothermal that 's a unique proposition that typo hairs that no other district will have we will also carry on in the tourism air and as you know i gave a briefing to the counselors not too long ago about these larger projects are on the gold as currently around about 11 on the goal and the goal magazine to give you some idea we 've sold about seventy thousand dollars worth their advertising so this comes almost at a neutral cost it 's for the first time that we would have a dedicated magazine with 20,000 copies going being distributed around the country and and opportunities in this region that we can really go and market to this very small niche market of users that we know we can attract well we have a very good opportunity to get them here and when they 're here make sure they 'll build a business here so i wanted to keep it short and sharp at the point today you 've had my reports or we 'd wanted to open the floor to some questions before i do that i 'd really like to thank you because i guess it 's the last time I 'm going to see you in this configuration I really appreciate all the support we 've had over the time we 've been really really grateful for the support because that 's what we work on we use as many people as we get our hands on and I 'd like to close with sighing we 're hoping that when the next counselor comes in please please put some sort of sort of introduction for the new counselors in place that they 'll come to the hub and spend some time make decisions and get some sort of steering and feedback off what 's actually happening here and they signed some non-disclosure agreements we 're happy to also disclose all the larger deals with work thank you any questions team okay well being I know they concur with me congratulations for doing a wonderful job you really have risen from the ashes so to speak I mean you making a great impact for our district and I think also an at the back of room there good on you for rum taking up the this employment youth issue that we do have it is hard to get right youth with the right school so um I think that 's a very big n good thing that you 're doing there so keep up the good work and be the last time I 'll be seeing you in this format so I look forward to seeing you Adam Adam meet in the arena but once again you are doing a great job I think so keep up the good work and tap I will thrive because of that I 'm sure thank received from a great lake top and their representatives movie please move counter downer Thank You cancer Johnson all those in favor all right they won 't leave thank you okay minute _"

Piazza thank you first played appointment I can 't see me on equations or and we have confirmation from the sure optimist if you have a look old I don 't actually say that bad Oh which one sit on the back of the cycle challenge a lot to this day as well yeah if we are yeah I get me a get feeling that there would be desired to because that you can wear to don 't show you that doesn 't_''_213.88 at all I think what I 'd rather do is maybe have a discussion with new council on that because I think I think the question is whether or not a sexy garden is something that they provide something on something maybe we can come back and revisit so maybe come up some other plans which shop creates a new garden maybe it 's alright psychology no no so this opportunity that 's do something different paths that said I got the impression as a desire to recreate some other garbage from us but my concern at the moment is that we 're removing something and whilst it I think in the management planning did say that it would be replaced removed and replaced the resolution really is just I could change it slavery I did approach again virtually both side on other half cab rank approach rotary for funding whether they will allocate some fungal forward replacement gods as well I just tried to chase it up because I was off last week and now highly responsive it 's that when 's their meeting which last Monday I think so I 'm unclear whether my funds available not sure yet that 's crazy you should do it Jim the issue of it was that with people that weaselly set it up is none of them that exists was stevenson and a big input in certain areas of rosin that 's right so there 's not no one that was in the original setting up a bit that 's that 's still alive and it was discussed that it could be replaced if there was designed for the socks and mr. sanella at the moment so that 's a historical sort of thing that happened but they wouldn 't they wouldn 't rule out that would be replaced at the moment is of course neglected and hasn 't been to the council painting at the audience it concerns me that we removing something that was originally established by service club for Fatah ho same as your service club and they 're at the moment whether we do replace it whether it 's necessary to replace it is not really the issue in my opinion it 's it really fact that we do not have any confirmation from the Sri optimist club but they would like it to face them all the way barking mmm maybe that could come under the suggestion resolution number one the winner and officers each item in design consultation internet what were they paint the area join in place of just people also a job just to just be clear than just always 0 comments times z1 heavy with their dinners we put then and there that it cancels spring Baker 's a constant so often I see how I appreciate council cracks it is not the new young Scottish rottenness were still hated the cliff still active is and I explained what I 'm saying is that the people have set it up reasonably there 's not a thing that I 've shown any interest in it since we 've been using that area of the park for the purposes of events but as there is a cloud still in clear and we should consult in there isn 't much don 't get shot it I I agree thats that 's GoPro see any dirty shot says it 's time in the shoulders and the back of thing of amber is one the next event is if you want to double for that button then you said the decision is very quickly if you don 't want that shifting that 's fine this is just request have a good the time isn 't mr. issues but surely we say years with it was our office I mean something they should have been approached anyway layer and they don 't want it worse to him if I can I think your way through movies are they they obviously they talk about when an opportunity location of course elements John Rambo scale so obviously thinking about a replacement this john city has talked to recycle challenge be a few counselors or mine to you could pass the resolution saying that the teeth gotta go will be removed at the cost of the fun challenge is to be the resolution is there as what Britain up and they never do one day they future the possible future we look at future relocation of the of the garden for similar people back to to a future council what sort the list well there 's a national say something else in traffic physique design team sorry traditions three mr. chicken will get asked questions yet just I 'm unclear by half a discussion in terms of the gardener 's is kind of acknowledged not really I mean it was being happened how much we trust up to this spec that needs to be in this current location or what how much does it cost to build on you what 's the difference between the two anyway because if the counselor the word man can get some searching that we would have to spend the money to replace the garden regardless and provide some clarity of the way forward I cost of replacement operation yes I think we are and we need some certainty that the garden needs to be upgraded as it is because it 's not functioning as a Counsell Williams um but fifth today um what my eye I have had no involvement of us I must clarify that but but my impression from the sagene rifle is that their Lake Tahoe challenge july was a question about consecrate time that the scary activity and be four assorted am raja culture to remote Asgard and they need to discuss casing it somewhere else so why would we want to maintain my place where none want something used month notes and fearing a pollinator very moment other than I i think the clarity in that is that the total water understands the reserve and the fact that the center gap has always been proposed to be moved under that reserve management plan so it 's actually an activity that kills a little based rainfall and so they are just trying to take advantage or and capsule plan to speed things up between them so there 's no problem 'm perceiving it to be is the cost of replacement but where I 'm trying to help is that we may have to wear that cost anyway because that garden needs to be brought up to spec whether it 's in its current location high value and I 'm just trying to dig out do we have the budget for that work to be doing because if we do then surely the replacement is not really additional talk about the design if we don 't have the project how do we create that which is because it should have been funded through the reserve version odyssey is it 's a place we just get a drink and homeless people sleep in your nails of you might say it made a lot of money to tidy up and whether we be seeing some curry us because of exactly what council William seeds I agree with all that to mr. chair but I mean Keith keeps brought up the issue of history well the cycle challenge because we started start him on there used to be way back nearly GFC so they now the one that 's going to remove it for okay that 's fine but how are you porn visit to move this year I mean it 's been there for you know the entrance of the starting points been on it for probably five to ten years and yet all of a sudden becoming issue and we haven 't gotten and the nuts and bolts have always tied down that 's my real concern about no problem with it breathing I 've got no Ivan God problem if we don 't miss a visa go on to be perfectly honest and I guess the cable to mr. it 's got nothing to do at all with staffing is to do with the setup of the domain catering for 25,000 people when we have our hospitality tents we head out is in a key area where we had a safe and screen where all the imagined about we have to do to get in 25,000 people get that 's the problem it 's not an easy starting problem starting better to resume where to start and so casually crave be know your organization because that 's all the center cons on it is on five of the screen business it 's probably only about 400 public key part of it there where the fire power happy Andrew screams okay all the CSS comes the ends of time signing off geology when we now we need for another with I just need to point here because I 've got a lot of history on the domain we spent a lot of money putting power of the mind this is power good source of power for everything that happens on the design and it 's not near the

Reese ten thousand dollars there okay we 're getting off the subject of this slide here Holly hold the whole idea second most in the measurement plan it 's got to ship one day why baby vs area it 's really under the tiny this weather we remove it now in time the cycle challenge will we leave for more consultation Council you I 'm yes I 'm on the street for that mr. chairman crash the second part to their a room of 50 under fire ending that dude item that capsule offices the instructors Debbie 's resolution as privately resolution that country offices be instructed to worser openness to to design the sediment another the you and in funding requirements and that 's not problem see actual time it 's removable moving yeah but i guess i guess to tell a capsule headphones concerns i think it 's squad shall beat ya as well as there are mobile and working with surplus for st. another gardener so plan to speak to give that gun join you 're not going to be actually moving before their site which other know you something i 'm not saying that to do that earth to the remote I 'm not found really frightens me another sign of its resolution but there are mobile it 's removed now have a discussion of it yeah level 10 yeah I think you 've had another 's number one when they were really the turbo Lana and they were third in the council officers proceed to much schedules with throttles we 're the time I understand what you 're saying are the timing has covered under number ones here that they then be removed immediately out I 'm sorry i I 'll walk walk Izzy one kid moves suggested resolution of the third plan so I was impatient with the sauce we 're not going to complication to the removal but that sketch annoying families and so change to the regime around yeah should be fun okay better move of the counselor Williams the senior counsel the crate all those in favor and I really go to please get all those in favor I goes against Chancellor headway _"

hopefully you remember back to the vendor December one of the reasons why we decided for that time they 're doing measurable degree we all sit on side of the table is because we had a single into private oh that they wanted to further discussions those discussions have been taking place between two prototype and tiara river even trust so i can send confirm those discussions happen to you in our continuing what they have done is as times gone past the bolt broke our so the three year we are now discussing about how they deal with the areas of overland we 've got areas of over making interest with those three within our district it provides and challenges what the legislation might work forward is some is the one picture but some from their own cultural perspectives there are different medicine play it 's really important for e to the Z we and to make sure that their own areas of interest are reflected as a result we haven 't pushed or rushed their discussions on those particular issues we 're very much taking a back seat and stay to contact and any major things moving but it 's a very much back into the stage as they discuss the mountain themselves are they want to proceed I just feel young the thing that I confirm for you is that the discussions have taken place continue to take place and by all accounts are then quite successful so I would expect with the next few months we get some firm guidance from t-ara over n0 time about moving that 've got the impression that that there was some issues that were just unresolved tailings you know what the issues are all Sunni it was some at the back of the agreement we haven 't met which identified an area of interest for terror that tongue that the joint management agreement was going to fight it that was actually a smaller area than with a g5 and the upper we had a river legislation however to Kyoto had some concerns around how their area was described in words in the document a description around areas of specific interest so it was really a discussion point about how their area of interest that the jan-may applies to is described manners as say related to a whole number of different issues and different stationary processes that two protos in both so these cultural and these areas of significant sir and some respect and some environmental cultural sleep what work out these areas the legislation identifies areas geographically on a map of survey plan and says the drug management agreements will apply to those areas what Tierra has done in the joint management we are define it as the area within which we have specific interests to fry otara come back this irritation we have interests in the area as well because NSA we 've got these over mechanisms and as a result we just want

that 's quite a walk what 's intended is through this process will some agreed outcomes see if we can reduce the duplication of a plan posit looking to make sure that decision making is more enable going forward so that diagram just shows that I guess for the seven some districts like me poverty 's come up with the top i 'll hit this or the presentation people you know it 's the same presentation to councils so we 're going to make sure that certain information to one councillor up to alec but it was about looking down i currently with a very quickly we logically got three sub-regions we had topless forth so we 've got whistled at finding which is how long that whistle bait many districts camisa de comer up on contain the roots river district is another sub region in Cabo so the would include the time is focused around those sub regions listen Bo Pelini has smart growth as here in the stage of spear generation version of that that 's the agreement and future-proof what happen that is more less insulation playing for Western I offended what we 're currently doing is we releases by reason and then I broke through to produce the sub-region specially for its separation they information and i guess some of those outcomes shin-bi 's are intended to be gone out and filled enough to a regional special babe and we certainly trying to get a better name for which we discussed this thursday the slide becoming frontages witness stated player he 's like how we see I he says three sub-regions me up the intention with the station plan is that I speak with one voice must set some priorities we can certainly see outcomes so the organization being the deck where to some key outcomes whether that 's education achievement whether that 's growth with us in this free whether it is creating employment wealth it 's probably all the sort of outcomes in coming to it together the simple easy to understand from general public and I guess the sub theta made was some of those discussions with central government with other stakeholders and we also intended I guess is voluntary this is work to work across the existing legislative framework so we 're across local government maintenance work but it 's not intended will soon take away somebody 's existing requirements in today 's legislation nordson telling in particular council plus their buying decisions are retained for each individual council just lastly concerns all of the next steps we currently yes I do derecho asking the council 's to endorse the project plan endorsed letters it 's a piece of work leaders of all detail work we 've recently disappoint your project record so they 've been in person the protein is very much intended not the pc as Leyland Regional Council seeking to do something that maybe another nation Greg Emily we want to make sure that there is a buyer and support across the council 's Olivia sex it 's not a regional project designed by the loosely supreme Oh buddy isn 't gzel the council 's so the first phase is doing the sock taking situation analysis and will so bill our economic consultancy basis wellington bobby was looking for bit of existing information existence census information economic development data and is he actually packaging that up the 7th phase is looking at amount of growth lame the government is a business angle and the questions what does that mean these are the same conversations as well it 's very much about using existing information we can so not reinventing the wheel of going out being other information that we were here ultimately we are under so much content to Waikato so we 're looking at in this function plan in place by the next year probably importantly with the duel with we recently enter a Quisling hum akele magazine included supper and then we so the information will be available this sub-region level I understand that that information be useful to rightly so yes we he 's a threesome it 's probably not important reason ahead so I 've alluded that and inventors will learn the spot almost religiously and happy to throw open to the floor Jim if you want questions each of other day that I myself more than happy to go calling all around yeah thank you very much for your presentation but to go through the ocean of that I would a stroke I guess we 're hitting members or and hopefully many existing on the cuts the next train him I should they wish to be involved as there any opportunity for them to become what I mean it 's become part of the others district that part of the leadership grow tall how was the communication channel between our district and the apts and if we 'll see you know one time my piece of you said lights are so obvious that we are all connections that way that we do you know where only from Waco Regional Council and we 're in a difficult position so that we can look at the foot of both but with our geothermal you can 't like that I 'm sure as a council at present so can we and to be as much help as much involvement that we came camping with central government reforms and so far this is the way that they are fortunately be proactive and look at what efficiencies that can come out of there is a a whole region here like like using that we need to be ugly as well Xenia reasons finances to do by planted within it capo do and I hope we do join phase two what are your expectations of commitment financial community 3d message it I 'd like to say we use their money very allocated or like oh this stage there isn 't any funding being sought ok even for stage 2 there is a decision that will be discussed with a little sugar some very some money is the reason Council budget and realize that we chose the same as they 're contributing to this address fewer belts poultry names and a lot of work with the Waikato region stories Kim the trains presented by that 's not we 're not different the linkages of garrison so I think brain which we use the language the work interviews will be very very similar to create a whole original story and I seek to my leadership group you know I was really concerned about the money the budget so that sort of thing I thought if we start arguing about the money now we lost apart so in cases we 're very flexible we haven 't first phase which is great as well say but if you want to be however that we 're median is immediately bring you on board but it 's not going to be expensive because of the Virginians long-term are going to be this distance happy because we 'd rather do it to ourselves in around I checked on you shell has been the beast yes and rather do it yourself young Christians well thank you for bonus question counselor Kaminski want to be involved and also can I say it said we feel so white bubbles only government says communication with you experience the rotorua and nisha that we 'd like to build on there as well in your future connections will also help us as well and the city 's the resolution we 've got the information become related to the boat into the spatial plane we received from swish leader opera broken and winters thanks so much _"

anjuman winters along and also our locals I guess counsel me so just to make sure that my microphone drawn because this is will and also get apologies for the erect Cooper so that 's why I 'm cheering just today and also help apologies from councillor scroll innocent in good Saturday night so I those apologies counselor counselor typically form as a favor Keri okay so item number 1 i 'd like to welcome this wish at the mill road rilakkuma winters and though gazecki leaf pronouncing ever pronounce it right from my opinion regional council so if you 'd like to come forward worship move you up to you now this is for the to kill the real paper Nick even winter the hope media voted or good afternoon counselors who use the public and to idea I see what I was media operated under also being liquor she office leadership reported by appealing to drive this special things about me so we come along each day to proceed to do and i know you are doing in you are following the forward streams for the box both the workout on writing the waters of the thing so we looked at those from a baby minis in cheers system in for the work streams while a magnificent pieces of work for the entire why can 't we just wanted to concentrate one works trip and that was integrated plan and so tell you you 're going to see a very highly overview of what we 've started in the Bay of Plenty and I know we 've been titled that the baking station plan but be really uncomfortable we may see the word spatial or unitary pain because of what 's happened in the auckland and the open unitary pain this is not about is not about amalgamations and what it is about is that those of you who wing to the local government complement back what if you John Key say local councils you need to work better together right across the spectrum be at regional councils the equator capsules having all your resources that we can make this both classes in terms of local government being the bezel community and so this spatial plan i 'll call it that for a while but we 're actually a change for now we don 't know what it is yet but we 're going to find a really inspiring name to give the sleeves so that people don 't think of God it 's not just another plane this is about being decent me and so what we 've company today to do is to say to our district council if you are interested we more than happy for you to have been relentless we 've also offered to set back out to be part of this if you 're interested and we also offer to give them to be part of this plane I know you 've got very strong allegiances with white our Regional Council and you 're a bit by ourselves and go to do it we 've got half a foot in region and half a foot in the baking provisional Council so we split down the middle as well that i use for me our legions teens three with the by apt more so more so than waking up so that 's a sort of high-level overview can I usually stay at me today if he 's going to take you through there 's only a little slides but it 's just a very very easy presentation to come to grips with on how as we as local government how can we pull their resources work together better across boundaries and to say this is the Beast we can ever be in response to some of the Crown 's directions and changes that they require for so that 's sort of highly skilled at me thank you for your we are welcome in your attendance in the opportunity to see David I think here you wish it I 'm Council I might stand on this side of the house I can switch I 've said they 're artists living slides he probably actually really well and that 's just what we 're going to discuss what we know is equal to whatever we 're doing it perhaps three times way and to it without asking for money from your counsel other councils at this point of time in regional council has some money through the England plan phase 1 i 'll just went through the slides there will be questions no doubt a lot of what we 're trying to do is to talk about what is best for the boat painted so as a region he said that is a network of communities we have connections down south with tougher constantly white presidents and those connections he reported target it 's important person are joined up we have a very good collaboration amongst the council 's in a boat across the district and City Council 's and regional council we also have I guess absolutely Lisa would already in place my latest projections which already has industry things is actually it 's up without in Central Local Government correctly so those are things that we want to come up in order to put them into this a document or tool box that can be used to engage with central government and the eastern engage with industry peewee about how we can make this candid indicative of the spatial plan is to provide a high-level tool to be a unified voice envision for region perhaps importantly to prioritize fundamentals so when we have conversations with the government it 's about helping with thank you but Malcolm to get commitments to some of the priorities and one of those moment is like to relax make sure we clean up the lakes improve the water quality necessary that some of the government 's committed to this so begin to identify those high priorities will enable the council 's to go to central government about how investors money in the region it 's also about collaborating with like yo collaborate in a way that it 's cost savings efficiencies for the council 's but also I guess having that critical mass to birds been able to so a lot of the work program is alive with wake up the same time frame to the Des Moines using some of the same information but there 's some stakeholder engagement tools perhaps importantly it 's also about beginning of the game before legislation get some photos on us by central government so looking at the RMA they 'll get a reforms out coming up doing some of our monthly you want what we 're going to do a certain city government will yesterday legalization that collaboration we can actually do themselves just like motility so special plan itself the idea is come through the years and years it 's come through the training mission expose part of as a result of evolution tribbles established was his b which is SSG provocations over here can move from camera and also achievements regional council looks like that be a couple of team executives to provide us I 've talked about before about some of that context the government 's push for efficiency some of the reforms I they were having workshops held with all the recent so those workshops I 've had 40 to 50 little members from across the region the team they have presentations from New Zealand travel agency or policy office restricted environment as well as others today I guess my gain momentum for music years to silence project _"

    "text": "okay moving on now to agenda item number 13 adoption of the annual plan this is very very mechanical if what you 've been working on for the last what we started my troubling and here it is your annual plan how to fix the district food to turn the 31st next year no your worship fences afternoon to two made by the jorts Angeles we finished deliberations on the m20 first of May and essentially what we 've done now is we 've put the changes from those deliberations into the document to create a fine line your plan attached to my report is a strikethrough just showing the pages where the changes are it 's all right with you I 'd quite like to go through those pages so if you turn to page 33 in the agenda be on the right page and you see right on the front cover obviously we 've struck out draft there 's a few little changes in the table of contents in page three because we 've added at the back of the dot-com summary of changes that we 've made bar eight and thirty sorry thirteen bar 7 and 13 bar H you 'll see the message from the mayor and councillors in the message from the chief executive some minor changes there where we take out the words draft and change proposed to the food so essentially the message hasn 't changed just updating it in the draft document next page statement of compliance 13 by nine same thing just updating the date for the date of adoption page thirteen bar 10 now this page has changed a little bit because we 've added some new projects so you 'll see we 've got a new section in their democracy and planning we 've added the pre consultation for the development of the reserve management plan but the reserves in this after Western Bay settlements area and the review of the tree and vegetation policy you 'll also see under projects that council has delayed or removed but we 've taken out the projects for the new cell at the borderlands landfill because that 's already been completed you 'll see also that under business as usual services and 've updated that because the funding from central government has come through so that 's just you 'll also see on the next page thirteen bar 11 the text on lakes rivers and mountains has been updated again in accordance with funding being received from sent 11 page 13 by 12 which is the community facilities activity we 've just added a cross cross reference under what we plan for 2013 2014 to show that some of the projects that some people might think that under community facilities actually in this plan are sitting under the moxie and planning and so to refer them to page 50 so that 's for the review of between vegetation policy and the reserve runs with 27 my point age 13 by free in solid waste you 'll see we 've taken out the under what we planned for 2013 2014 the project for the new cell at problems as as I 've said the floor it 's really been completely we 've just added in for clarity under the next project there this if necessary council look at the cell at boredoms Road another mistake that was not outlined on this page we 're looking at how we fund solid waste services and you 'll see refuse collection says here if it 's funded one hundred percent by general rate in one hundred percent by fees and charges also it 's not possible so there 's a mistake there and the general rate one needs to do on out so it 's funded by fees and charges and also you 'll see them say that has on the next line recycling collection is funded by a hundred by targeted rate and the 75% uniform x 13 x 15 democracy and planning um essentially we 've added those two new projects the reserve management plan and the review of the tree and vegetation policy to what we plan for 2013 2014 and what 's different from the LTP they were also included in that section and you 'll see and there was a text box in the draft annual plan that talked about the long-term plan 2015 and some plan changes and were just updated the text on that because things have changed on a whole section of a table on transport expenditure you move and don 't worry it 's not nearly as dramatic as it looks it just happened that we 've repeated that table twice so if you go back to the graphic annual plan you see it was just AM and error and then in the fees and charges 13 page 13 x 17 right through to 226 all we 've done you 'll remember in the draft annual plan there 's a lot of sprite through and all we 've done to show the comparison between and the fees and charges and the last financial current one that we 're in a moment ND 13 x 14 year and just to show the differences we 've just taken those strike threes out and so now all it does is show the fees and charges for 2013 so that 's all that is so that 's at the end of the fees and charges 1327 you 'll see we 've added some text and this is what we normally do just just put in the back of the final annual the final version so that 's just some reason what those changes are and obviously then 13 x 28 and 29 is the removal of submission form as we don 't need them anymore that 's a final document now there have also been some minor page numbering and formatting changes and the final document but generally it will look very similar with episode of exceptional I 've also been some changes in the finance section of the annual plan because of course we awarded some additional funding through the deliberations process and I 'll just let mr. Ward afternoon counselor only this the CEO is quite simple for us in terms of the financial changes you put an extra 60 thousand dollars into the budget for the grants which stated on 13 bar 27 effectively that just flows through the cost of service statements for that in effects basically your financial element statements been your income statement night so we just flowed all that through with recast a little bit of interest cost to to balance it out to keep the rights of the 4.4 s where we went number being the 4.4 Everett rate increase stays the same and we 've just made the adjustments accordingly for those additional grants you know one three or four months but new world of mystery maven and congratulations into the rest of the team congratulations on the savings that have already been identified and of course getting the projected rate almost halved again to where we are so it has been a lot of hard work for us management and asked his government so i 'll just ask now that we get a mover in a seconder for the resolutions to adopt the annual plan the funding impact statement and the schedule of fees and charges for 2013 to 2014 and we have come to the kirk and come to the crate all those in favor say aye all right against diff thinks honest antic and vote against number three of the resolution yeah I understand why yes prepare to fees and charges okay so if you could just perhaps how will we do that with a resolution can you vote against one part of the resolution of course it 's think sorry oh no no no it 's all a favor I see mr. Ward are you doing sitting of rates for 2013-14 oh yes you believe I am everybody on webcams watching excellent not guilty and yeah well I suppose this is probably one of the reasonably important resolutions for the year otherwise we can 't turn collect any money legally which be a bit of a problem really and okay so this item is enabled as it says enables council to set the rates for the 13-14 year in accordance with section 23 of the local governor a teenage now I just need to make one minor change to the suggested resolution that 's a technical change but it 's quite an important one um that pursuant to and we insert the words section 23 of the local government rating act just need to make that insertion there please and then the rest of it can be as read and that is obviously both on the if you like front why yeah it 's just in the suggested resolution we can add those words then that will make the edge of rates on 14 bar 3 through to 14 bar 6 must be included as a schedule to the minutes I must form part of the minute inclusive and then we have a severe suggested rizal would you have any questions ok there 's a suggested resolution on page 14 that pursuant to the local government rating act 2000 to the Taba district capital air biceps the rates and charges as described in the schedule of rates 2013-14 attached for the period commencing on 1 July 2013 ND on 30th of jun 2014 in accordance with the council 's long-term plan 2012 22 and the annual plant is has a 13 to 14 including the funding impact statement if you 're a mover move contra Williams stick in there please come to the Johnson all those in favor say aye aye against thank you for moved I think we 'll break now for what if we got to get through _"

Lewis is involved with the reg group in the waikato he 's involved with the development of the routing work stream outcomes and he 's and that 's one of the considerations we have in total is that we are having to deal with the dual responsibilities that we have both in the waikato and the bay of plenty so our staff resources is tailored in both directions and the chief executives are reporting back to the mayoral forum and all that information is being provided back to camps was so from a chief executive perspective I 'm comfortable that we are being represented because there are actually no political decisions being made at the moment it 's the majority of the work that 's being undertaken is very technical and it 's very information based in terms of gathering information and data that may change in the future from my perspective as a chief executive in terms of what I would want to recommend to counsel and I can 't speak from the political perspective so I 'll send an email to shabako and if he will allow a council representative I do think they 're actually winding down I got a email i haven 't rid of her did I think you folk at karapiro and I think now been put off the last elections or done a discussion is it ok so I 've got an email they 're having had time to read it you come to let our poor job or any came yesterday so working the pages 11 14 11 15 11 16 17 okay so there is a good news story in there and council Henderson did pointed out and yes he 's quite right meteors in the room and I think um might sell all newspapers but hey we 're way under our forecast way under our budget savings investment returns are doing well interest costs are down it 's a good news story and staff should be congratulated come to a project performance highlights any questions on that 11 x 19 and of course going through anybody really want to ask any questions on this river road community will i see you pointing to is not being used was being used for a kindergarten for a while i think you 've got preschool nobody 's used against at all justin be looking at the costs of it 's a very similar circumstance to the last triennium capital had to remember we had a halt at why Ricky village it was a beautifully built hall tongue-and-groove tower timber an altered state and total disrepair we sold it for a dollar to the school and because it then belong to school to school got a million dollars from education board and that 's a beautiful hall and they let all the public user so we just want to investigate this one it 's just not being used that 's nobody wants that nobody loves it but it 's a lovely building so where to from here work in progress anything else on on construction is now competed on point if you add mr. Russell thought a little bit more to go but we got two more to do next year the way didn 't we have more non in the annual plan what you see is we all they 're going to get now just a question with regard to the terrain community facilities review I say we 've got the stage of public consultation but the time just get a bit of feedback on what the process is going forward to take the results of that consultation to answer slip the room is he here is probably in any way and we will be looking at going out for public consultation shortly we 're just looking at the process and how we do that in the thymus will net and will bring something back to you either through the next council agenda or informally through email and the next week or two anything more these pretty well self-explanatory ya can 't women driven yes yeah I just looking at the beautiful precious attorney and I was just wondering and educate the turbine total on some question we 've got some we have got some gear which has been donated by muddy river power and we 're still working with the other power companies of the region to try and find some other leftover materials but a stall hunting it as we speak might have been donated yeah this doesn 't make he knows we 're not gonna sure the council of them see no pictures it for will do anything more in the chief executive his report please no that 's the wastewater plan I 'm Troy categories can I just make a comment on these pretty pictures 11 bar 42 I see that two ladies clothes proposing a intercity bus state that way streets in front of taco I mean the cost of a one-off situation with a structure like bad compared with what we 've got but I must have a lot of money in theory i would venture to say that this is a dream child of a certain fridge i 'm not going to mention if anyone thinks bloody like this my right that 's fine yeah i think i think it 's important to point out these artists and present impersonations impressions and impersonations but there are I 'm not it 's not really that flesh but if you actually have a look at what torini currently has oh it 's like a packing crate that the wind blows series so and see the photograph well say somewhere between the two maybes a happy balance I hope so so there 's a with jun 2013 be received Counsell Williams come to a quick favor I moving now to you know I 'm sorry come well I decide I 'm to leave you but I 'm sorry I know I know I 'm just stop cut enough for you your worship but I would like to take the opportunity to thank the chief executive fences our forum is such a comprehensive report and format and it 's certainly easy to follow and and read and we really appreciate them just reiterate especially in regards to ring it 's great to have our Gantt chart here that 's showing us like the whole timeline but stage two and three the Chum I know seems to be finished we 're starting around October which is great likewise for the AC fans very good you know item number 12 _"

little bit confused when I first saw this um but mr. all he 's been in touch with mr. buddy time I 've got my head to the rowing club around here and I thought they were going on the piece of land and they 've should have got their eyes on too but they haven 't no say that the piece of land that the yacht club is looking at could you see where its marked on your agenda item yeah you must really do want to extrapolate on that or does anybody want to ask any questions especially contact me uhm Allison it it talks about a new pen is is this building going to be the same as the concrete bunker type building so could you explain perhaps it 's more in the nature of outdoor storage yeah I took that from the item but when you say outdoor storage is it 's the construction look at the actual construction will need to be appropriately designed and attractive I was going to say home yeah I know the concrete bunker don 't look that smart but at least it consistent with what we 've got down the araphi little bit want to be more than just a standard hurricane mitch security thing yeah i wouldn 't i personally i wouldn 't like to see them they 're not proposing a building as such it is outdoor storage say here the license if granted will include a clause requiring that the club submit a plan of defense for approval by council offices in terms of style and appearance prior to commencement of construction would would cancel laws as well like to see that artist 's impression author whoever does the impression I to give a bit of conflict you worship it would give a bit of comfort inn I 'd like to move the resolution ya got moves resolution so I go back you want to just like to say because it is lakefront and I 'm a highly possible i would like really yes that 's my be

full sorry we need to come back to another council meeting to get your approval yep well as two councils put here and I support them I 'm not just gonna sit here blah blah look for the sake of it my jaws but I support them and that is a very very visual place and we don 't want to see a deer fence go up the whole lot of post-election should sort of set the tone of what i want to see come back and it was moved by and there 's a third part that the proposal is approved by council i guess we could even do it at workshop if we have to do we just want to see a picture to give us some comfort um just to clarify i 'm happy to move the existing motion for a delay but I 'll go with the majority decision on that but I withdraw moving the motion if it 's a deter that 's probably more suitable someone else moves up draw the motion if somebody want to move a motion with that close tree comes a heckling seconded by Councillor Williams counselors to approve or as in favor right carried thank you i 'm joined counselor let 's forget so that though it doesn 't need to be it butterfl no no no we did a workshop or something yeah we 're just drawing a line in the center we don 't want to DFCS do we yeah um counsel oh sorry agenda item number 8 miss Rowley this is a fairly procedural item David and Stephanie Mooney trading as outdoor amusements have had trampoline bungee and various other amusements at the far end of North reserve yes to the mini-putt for the last three summers they want to come back and operate there again the summer and would like to make it a regular thing so that they would be allowed to have a license to the way works I 've done at every George council staff tunnel sorry and the management plan provides for licenses for up to a five year period but the Moonies have not applied for a license for that to him previous to now they now to come back on a more regular basis and have a more long-term agreement with counsel it was still only be for a month at any one time but over a five-year period my jet you didn 't see any negative impacts of it there last Christmas right and this other counselors have got any issues I 'll ask for mover yep let 's have a bit of background on how we currently trading similar licenses five years does seem a long time at that stage doing and what 's proposed that understand council wouldn 't get the opportunity to reconsider that any stage during the five years is that correct five years no but that 's what we 're suggesting we give them not much to just you know just ask why they didn 't but they don 't they but no matter can they they want they want five years they did 15 years it 's in the resolution yeah yes we 're proving here today a five year license for one month of each year yes it 's a genuine really just so that I don 't have to keep coming back every year for the next five years for something that everybody seems to be quite happy with really if there were any issues with their performance then that would be a breach of their license and we would have grounds to terminate the license vision there hasn 't been any so sleep we haven 't had any grounds to terminate the license in the past in fact last year with the drought they had their own pool with the water rollers I was quite concerned about the effect of turf with it having set up for a month but actually the turf did very well quite nicely with all of that extra water so now we haven 't had any issues for performance if we were to grab the team of five years would it be to David and Stephanie we we tend to grant licenses as a personal to the to David and stiff money rather than to the company and they I prefer to make them non-assignable so that they can 't_''_466.389 be bought and sold I wish have they got a proven record of performance I to last year they 've been the owner off the last three years so yes let 's just move the suggested resolution ever in the item number nine this is fairly self-explanatory and this this is an interesting one and you may recall seeing this situation before where it came to you as a proposal that we grant an easement for a long-standing encroachment of a driveway on reserve and the decision was made at that meeting that we sell the land to the owners of the adjoining section remember this team since that time has been a survey done of the proposed boundary and there is an opportunity to make it a change of land rather than a revocation and sale of land now the exchange of land it 's a slightly simpler process to undertake council has a bit Minister of Conservation and it 's also more palatable to the local community generally if they perceive that they 're getting something in return so I 'm proposing that rather than go with the revocation and sale of land which was what the resolution was last time you saw this that we go with an exchange we do things easy ways in the hard way gen release I 'm not saying it 's going to be easy but maybe she perhaps another move I 'd like to move the suggested solution to nominate myself for the it foxy anybody else like to be your date committee as well justjust no just a point of clarification was it a resolution that we may before or just a recommendation that 's a resolution I do we not have to revoke that resolution I 'm not entirely sure I mean as the item be taken to scarify a new issue if it was a resolution then we need an item to revoke it and replace this if you check on that old I will defer adjourn this agenda item until miss Jake 's i 'm in favor of it you want it but just just procedure procedures right what I read in south which museum on sunday no one ever made any money out of doing a job twice do it like the first you know item number ten will I 'm sorry confessed to add to the I don 't mind doing anyone know yeah I just adjourned the item yeah I 'm until we just make sure we 're not okay we got a resolution blocking us over three and i 'll take it on board great who 's just a third one want to go on this that 's not a negative it 's an automatic yeah but we need an adult committed to the odd the submission process i think is it not yeah because we have are you got to advertise you don 't have your knife and you get us a mission yeah we 're not we might get us some machine room okay it is it but a clean the item number 10 is this um everyone to ramrod this is another exchange of lane and must stay in Salem can answer any questions you may have about the transaction you questions from countless so this is just opening up one piece of the total peace isn 't it so this is just oh sorry versus their old mahou ii district council site it 's now been given access on to crown road but as I understand this only in part only 41 lot and there you can 't you 're not going to be able to drive through that lot and get into all the others at citrus chitra so my holy street will then link to Clara dashdrive and this one section of the frontier has access on the crown right so clip i flash the access area is the little green bit yes the green the green bit on the agenda when you say that 's little at 16 meters why doesn 't it 20 meters wide so that marked here is 20 meters meters so that when they 're buried that 's 20 meters let 's say a whole all block okay yeah so this is they 're going to take that up and service the motocross and maybe one day comfortable developer because we leased it to the motocross and this section here at the front they get access onto but not on to but you can 't get that link that to that I just given is just giving access to lot 10 yes only then does locked in allowed access of that road as well third beam our hwy ste extension lets user scenario let 's say it 's some sort of big box retailer or who should we call it somewhat selves fence posts and gates some cell Tomic so he drives them and he 's got a building and it 's got a whole lot of stuff there my question is is he allowed access of that right in there the V is you 've just linked it up heaven yeah we 'll be road access onto both roads so return that won 't be a through Road though so if I hold it up there and I draw a line there in crossed the f and call that a road would be road women in the what right through from one side to the other but it 's not a road peckham safe was there road but put it this way this property here and connect us off camera and it 's going to access off this road what they do is their business alone and within district bundles the stirrup lane does restrictions on the number of vehicle movements is equal to the sides and there is restrictions if not saying I 'm against it I 'm to clarify it gives wrinkling just just to give a bit of comfort Dennis I mean this this whole area segregation strip was put there to three reasons one to try and have a segregation strip between the industrial and residential that the other was to actually control vehicle access on the ground road in the early days are you is there any concerns about where that driveway is some cran Road entrance onto grand park on to crown road or are you you yeah but not as a very ready okay say you chose it cancel I 'm still not exactly clear on this as regards to undertake the boundary adjustment I 'm 26 of march two thousand thirteen was before or after Tinder 's council put out teen tenders for lot 10 because i have heard from a disenfranchised tenderer or potential tindra that that person that party had no knowledge that the some boundary adjustment was possible so i just like a state christian of wind of the Tinder 's clothes on this there wasn 't tenders it was on an old market sale we were only approached by one purchaser so sorry there was a long process for more than one several years ago and we only ever received one official offer ya wanna be we never got an offer but you people I say you got an offer yeah i mean i get some clarity for Counsell Williams em myself but you did have other people who approach looking at the heavy to be nice nothing looking more than yet than verbal love ya so counselor Williams 's question is when did you receive the offer because this was lodged on a 26 plane the offer to purchase the property with price Christmas me seen him but um he had got in touch with council officers regarding pitch similar problems told that that actually to gain excess off camera was not a possibility you know who bespoke to remember any conversation along those line so depends what they were asking for if they were saying kind of road before then then the answer would have been the same as to the current purchases and that 's no you can 't can you get extra soft cream road yes you can the two chip with grief questions always being it up there is a process to go through and what will be you know what will come out of that will come out of that we not we can 't preempt whether the access could be put in or not there 's a public process that we 've been through and that could have easily turned up multiple submitters against proposal so it 's been for the submission process ended now most submissions so then the suggested ridge of nobody submitting against it off work limit so the resolutions now that we kept request remover place move cancel Johnson seeking the council I understand all in favor carried okay agenda item number 11 she think oh I 've got the yeah without the detailed yeah going back to them and I 'm so I didn 't see the shakes come back in we go back to Jim nah man I 'm we had three very good volunteers young John Williams I 'm just but I 'm you worship um could I please ask you that did you did you get the gist of that chill Christian camp you need it repeated you don 't be okay five minutes it um going back to generate a number nine the ad hoc committee would be captured skirt comes with Craig Counsell heckling the suggested resolution reads 124 on page nine bar three so if we could have a mover for that place come to the cook in a seconder come so I Chris determine robbed you wish to comment on this at all okay um so can we take the report page by page please you 've got originally got the preface here chief executives report in bars free counter Williams I use some just a question that that 's not on the report I wonder if we could have an update other this meeting or next meeting was to our God 's to them the government the government 's intention to connect mining and this region and the submission that we have lost to make regarding how my effect may or may not have piqued our region it 's true mr. chairman it 's later in the agenda money was here yeah so it 's um item number 15 we 'll keep that to them so anything in the cubic dig reports on we live about two eleven bar three I come to him some I 'm just a matter of want to draw people 's attention to if you look on 11 bar 14 there 's a series of charts there and I think perhaps show that are worth drawing attention to today and I see the media is an attendance so it 's always good to have a good news story um the investment returns a running here too far ahead of forecasts running am quite below forecasts stopping staff in particular it 'll be much later on that it looks great but as i said before anything more on the chebyshev report summary living by to number three if not moving on made by page _"

    "text": "this is a tender contract thank you all for coming okay mr. Dennis this is a atender contract for electrical maintenance for the three water pump stations and treatment plants so any questions I 've do you want to extrapolate a little on it mr. Lewis or take it as read your worship answer any questions it seems like a lot of money to I guess you don 't know what is actually going to happen to them but am I reading this right where no matter what happens they have to fix it in this 600 k and if nothing happened am i right in saying that they end up with 60 to Cape another not quite correct you may have to service me a bit part of the contractors for regular maintenance on a to weekly monthly cycle to make sure that the preventive maintenance occurs and part of the contractors provision for reactive stuff when suddenly breaks down then they go and repair it so we based on previous years reactive maintenance we build an allowance under the contract for that so if I just might be the end of this contract let 's say two plus one plus four years when we come out three years nine month and all the equipment 's really tired do they sort of put band-aids on it to get to the end of the four years and we left with a case we had it just work what was this somebody over seen this where these just machineries maintained to a level three that is that is a Lancer main question well it 's fine cancel heckling I I see Dennis where we 've got three waterfront stations how many treatment plans does that include you know because surely it 's not just the three water pump stations it must be we must have there 's more than three conversations well well that 's what it says here how many station well on the title it 's three water 's bit which was the water water wastewater if a storm water so how many a deal with us sometimes it takes a while for the driver how many assets are these people maintain in for I think this in the bit of perspective on the price that 's it it 's also all of the electrical work associated with the treatment where 'd you go so there 's a sizable piece of work that they maintain most most of those are all automatic aren 't they all it 's the electrical component happening we don 't have on staff any qualifier nitrogen electricians and so they provide an exhibitionist service and I think under some legislation we have to score 24 hours of water fragomen say if we have a breakdown they have to fix that and make 24 hours okay well it does put a little bit more context on it when people realize we 've got 150 water pumps alone to look after them all year and that 's without going into or the other two waters so when we talk three water 's people watching webcam and things like that you know need to understand we 're talking taking away the backboard who are you giving the clean water and this maintenance down here on us new water pump would be included in it so there is company won the tender moves by council heckling seconded by Councillor Williams all those in favor say aye aye I 'm Troy ordered a question I thought you taken up my apologies I 'll break the truck up just um with regards to the new water treatment but maybe coming on stream and this here and will they have a secret separate contract as they come on stream or whatever covered by the some this contract for three water 's water treatment plant Wilhelm oldest remix one angel you were in for pollution July you would have parasites other they the other treatment cut some 45 major ones outside of us antinea they 're also slice for traveling all of the treatment plants water in waste the electrical components of those treatment plant cell business thank you all those in favor say aye I carried thank you next timber is a contract for the climate of a cricket pavilion which is an hour ltp and annual plan so who have we got a rib got mr. grid welcome mr. with I 'll tell the item is red you 'll be I was given instruction to go away and either fire have a submission through annual plan from the cricket association and or find monies from this current year 's budget so we 've done the latter so in front of you is the tender price back plus an allowance for contingencies which will be covered through the current budget current capital expenditure budget where is we have understand overs this financial year so I 'm over to any questions from the tendras ready to go if it 's accepted yep oh when we 're talking about financial year we 're talking about its financial year this current financially is current financial year we do that can we do this can 't forget just the question is the only LTP the budget was 465,000 and the tender have accepted is 213 plus a shortfall of 48,000 plus the 20,000 68,000 does that unbudgeted we did that the annual grant through the chair we have a number of tenders that come through during the year for less than what the approved budget is and what we are doing here is using 70,000 put towards this so it 's not an additional expenditure up and above what was originally planned when we look at the district as a total some thread system familiar with fam tour of the tendras but not successful one as they done wait for the house yup familiar with seen their work that quite a lot of we 've canceled that there are approved contractors list as well like all these tendras are the questions more cough remover counselor hickling second at Johnson Truman all those in favor I carried let 's see what arises out of the dust _"

interest I 'm pretty positive that probably during the discussions I did declare a conflict of interest regard in the golf club I had oriented I may have missed it or in passing that full resolution and I wondered if the council would oblige me with where it says note number one counselor hicklin declared a conflict of interest relating to the sports Advisory Council which I did but could we add

notes please this also move the Turing ut-tahrir community will administer dated Tuesday live in the gene also the resolutions mentioned in their 50 double 95 1 0 to PI 10 3 and 5 10 4 and I 'd like to speak to the resolution 51 double oh we have a seconder okay we don 't have to be in a meeting to seek of an eminent so I will seek in the minutes ah sorry why 'd you hit him up okay Carol Johnson make him a second I didn 't see your hand sorry um so you can have speak thank you Jim Rick I just want this morning have said I want to set out that a number of things have occurred in terms of the operating hours I think if you take for example the operating hours as they were and then the second lot of operating hours and the final trial operating hours which have been removed reverted to the original I 'm merely asking that council consider section 78 of the local government act which sees it should take notice of those affected people consideration to their views and preferences likely to be affected by them or to have an interest in the matter the other points about the pools performance the pools performance in terms of when it was designed on a a rate payer funded basis of ninety-five percent and five percent income or admissions it 's actually running out about twelve point eighty five percent admissions which is an improvement so what I 'm saying is increasing the hours to back to what the trial hours where would help in getting more usage of the pools what are the benefits to the users there there are the social economic benefits terms of those that are using the pools for for health benefits are saving the government central government will be a local government in terms of ongoing medical costs later on and I do understand of course the central government has removed the world beings which this was would have otherwise commander the other means of increasing the income bar could simply issue attack great if that 's required we could increase the admission fees slightly not to allow the increase in the hours as was trialed will will just simply run back to increasing the costs of running the pool because we won 't have the same percentage as we have now and cause staffing problems because it 's shifting when it comes to staffing would cause problems and attracting staff and keeping staff I just want to point out when finally that council when adopting a new plane in item number 13 council can adopt the the annual plan with any amendments also can adopt the funding impacts statement with any amendments I 'm imploring councils to reconsider reinstating the hours to the so the swimming pool orgy of opening I feel today that there is perhaps an appetite to revisit and relook at it I would ask my fellow councillors with their agreement that we move this to a workshop because there is counselors than here that I want to hear both sides of the story from from staff from people like we 've heard today I think we need to my opinion as we need to move this to a workshop and redress it at that stage council of innocent so the regard to the process of which council should consider these matters and clarity I just point out that we have ever as a council not yet received the information back from staff that when we made the original decision during annual plant operations we asked the staff to go back and recheck the hours within the existing budget so it 's still yet to receive that information so just for clarity I want people to know that and bearing that in mind which comes with Henderson has said the resolved 5100 touring ii tongariro community board that council be requested to reconsider its decision reconsider my olive branch to you is backed up but appoint counsel Henderson has said here where more information from our staff pleased that we moved that issue to a workshop and that workshop should be ASAP and if I have your my fellow councillors support with that that 's my proposal and hopefully its chair of the Congo during a community board and I know your passion come to a kipper I you could come along a Netwalker with us I think I know counselors you 're happy to move to move this issue to a workshop yeah country clipper all right I am happy with that although I just pointed out in my submission that that or in my statement the council can actually do it now again but I have counselors that have discussed us with me that wants or more information from staff about the impact so if you could the impacts of it if you could bear with us and I 'm hoping it wouldn 't be any longer than that a week or something we could have this workshop is that possible but and at the moment it 's open in end I would propose that we keep at status quo until post the workshop and then your cell my thunder sorry so rum okay but I 'm nearly arguing a lot about the costs of running gtech I 'm arguing about the social economics of it that is that it needs to have these increased hours and based on other facilities run by council such as the museum which only brings in three-point 52-percent the district libraries of five point sixty-two percent I mean the council Kepler you other chair of a board that formulated a resolution that says the council be requested to reconsider we 've just agreed to reconsider a workshop where we can get right down to the nitty-gritty of an end staff have just agreed to leave the status quo until we 've had that workshop on deezer saying that the board has already been presented with a really good I went for a vote was that the workshop would win the vote social I 'm not a lot saying that the the workshops gonna gonna win that 's the board has been presented with the figures previously the board has yes comfortable hasn 't and the board 's mader recommendation to this council which counselor Henderson god I 'm order there would level but didn 't support it council early hunter allow that here at counselor keep us I was draw that please take that there 's not on the minutes so we are going to move this item to a workshop and I 'll ask if that once again can we have some sort of guarantee that it will be in the very near future not the distant future and all saying Adam to limp yes thank you moving on there anymore matters arising from the Turing II community board Matt please being none we 'll move now to agenda item number five _"

those in favor aye now I 'm going to move the agenda around slightly but just before I do I noticed people hear from two ringy wanting to speak I had a request two or three days ago from Ian calls and Julie Mickelson we will hear those at the end of these two presentations understanding orders 10 minutes only in total is allowed so have a talk amongst yourselves ten minutes when ten minutes is up it 's over 't be discussing we 'll be listening today to your concerns read the pool Alice so if I got that clear please ok so now move to run a present take our first presentation today from our lakes and waterways Action Group I see Jane pentam here and we 've got broad Ryan Robertson acting chairman and Judy McGrath I both your friends here this Jane Jane thank you they want to come forward and support you the board and welcome Jane wants to bring your cheer up she 's welcome okay very good we 're in your hands okay I 'll good afternoon all curate a towel I 'm Brian Robinson and past chair of lakes and waterways our present chair Paul White is I think overseas at the month so he sends his apologies but I do have with me Judith McGraw who is another trustee and local farmer as well as Jane Clinton who is our secretary a long time administrator I think you have I would go to the first note here that the underlying theme of lakes and waterways has been the protection of the heart here we started off initially by looking more at kind of water chemistry and the chemistry of the waters in the chemistry that the ground waters but then we we went on to look more at the effects of land use and this is where I think the council came in and started to actually support support our goals so our goals of remain consistent in terms of seeking enhancement of water quality and in particular uniting Bennett people for the benefit of tuples natural environment and we 've been advocating for sustainable development thinking with respect to any development in the in the catchment and I that is really quite critical in terms of what kind of land use can we sustain in the in the catchment so we thank temple District Council for their continued support over the years that has allowed us to to have Jane is our secretary administrator and organize all the talks the monthly talks that we have through that through the year I just to note a couple of those because you can probably see them better in your in your hardcopy are incredibly important in the environment you know you can you can in agriculture learn you can fence or strange you can do riparian planting but you can 't_''_230.579 be having wetlands wetlands are the process whereby you can soak up all the nitrogen the nutrients and so on that you need to get out of the system before he gets into the groundwater a further one in June we had an update of terrible beef and this as well as the lake taupo protection trust update i should say this stage that we 've been we 've been heavily involved with the lake taupo protection project and supported them particularly in the last short while in terms of getting continued and enhance finance move the last part of nitrogen to get to this magical twenty percent figure that we knew we just hope that this twenty percent is his right because we all know that the situation within the lake is probably going to get worse because of the spike of all ground water coming in before it actually gets better and then we 'll find out what it need more but we probably know that we 're probably not that when we 're not going to get any more funding for that so I think we did very well all the organizations tablet us to counsel the Regional Council and ourselves supporting that in terms of getting this this additional funding so late Lake Temple protection trust i think is in there in the final stage of getting a winding up their business we 've been behind them all the way and a few things are stem fanned out like this this some concept of top or beef which actually came from a brainchild of poor white hair chair who devises slogan have grown right here and it doesn 't matter what it is grown whether it 's p for hazelnuts or three dollars or whatever but he had this concept of within this basin grown right here I 'm being kind of been environmentally friendly there isn 't necessarily and all all the systems within this basis now have to comply with variation five regional council variation five so they limited to your mat of nitrogen that that context environmentally friendly and they will differentiate within that themselves as to which ones are doing doing what in you know for four different kind of land land uses so we did have a talk in November on from New Zealand 's hazelnut expert that is one thing that will grow well in the area as well as as well as few hours we 're trying to look at their at different options in turn and particularly those that are low nitrogen into their putting low nitrogen into the into the environment because we know the lake knees protecting when we look at the lakes in Rotorua which are many of them heavily polluted then they 've got to the stage where they need actually remediation they need cleaning up whereas we don 't need cleaning up at this stage we just need kind of so that 's really the message so what we do on the land is going to get into the lake get into the groundwater and that 's why we have to be really careful and choose the best one uses that we can 't year that 's a continuation to talks the submissions in our advocacy role through to the TDC annual plan the Waikato Regional Council and we are represented on the following groups we 've we represented on top or near tier 2020 on the group so in terms of in terms of accuracy our message to developers are to request nitrogen budget from all all developments that includes what at a point source or the few sorts of nutrients and the developments include best practice for wastewater and stormwater treatment together with adequate monitoring and maintenance programs and I know the council has moved quite a long way in terms of that that was one of our first in lakes and waterways that was one of our first initiate initiatives to try and to try and address the point-source nitrogen and nutrients getting into the lake we 've now kind of covered that quite extensively and I think that we now then moved on to the more diffuse sources of nitrogen which are coming from the agriculture land use so I think that the highlight for the year for work for that extra funding from the government which I which I 've mentioned and the issues going forward Lake Taupo protection project we have concerns that the funding will not be sufficient but I think we 'll have to live with that folder for the moment and we move on to kind of environmental marketing marketing of the late tap or protection project that is how could we market what we 've already achieved and I guessed Apple beef is one of 11 example of that so I think those are the main things that we wanted to to address as a message is that we want to put over so if there are kind of questions at this stage we have a few minutes in these big thank you very much for your presentation I 'll just open up the counselors that have any questions of you I think your work doesn 't go unnoticed in fact we will get your agendas and multi ratings and you do a great job of promoting your goals so I know on behalf of all my counselors here we thank you for your we have a Miss district or perhaps even New Zealand yeah that 's that big blue lake up behind me there and literal hope and pray that the work you do and others do that it stays that pretty color so on behalf of all my counselors thank you very very much for work and may you continue long time thanks very much your comments Thank You Dora all right just we go I 've got to move that your presentation be received a move on a second please move councillor kicks thinking it counselor williams or lowe 's and a very hatful grateful say yes I mean I okay so thank you very much thank you _"

are at risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease alright and about sixty percent of them or utilize the pools at different times during the week well I 'm posing this change will be taking away the most effective in fun exercise for them and as you all know you know what is the best is the best type of exercise it pretty much any person can do especially the older ones we have a lot of comatose a lot on nannies if I go and pick up myself and take the Meneer in we do no pull exercises and stuff sir it 's not just the affecting the younger generation and stuff like that it is definitely affecting the order I rather have them come into the pools instead of just staying home and in in eating themselves to death is their site so just what I within the population of to Danny to continue to provide our high quality service in order to obtain healthy outcomes for our people by close in the polls in the morning is essentially detracting from the messages we are trying to promote within our community in limiting our resources I 'm going to put for a couple of benefits let the pools have doing the exercises on the pulse exercise for many that is pain free and with only minimal pain social stimulation places where they can come together in one right and stuff like that pre-op exercise and post-op exercise it is easy on the joints and confidence and the water over all right or just my last sort of message is surely the need in the community and the health of our farm Oh outweigh the money that you 're trying to save Georgia thank you for listening Ian thank you and Julie swimming pool hours hi I 'm Julie Nicholson um I was at the teroni meeting and I 've tried to bullet point some of the things that were raised at that meeting so I just not consulted about the change of hours at the pool and if that 's what they would like why is there no transparency regarding the decision to change the hours just a notice that was put in the pool window there was nothing in the minutes or the agendas um a count slower won 't user name I 'm stated at the Turing in meeting that anyone interested in Council issues should make a time to come and see him so 1 i 'd like to say how can we do this when there 's no transparency about what 's going on as a community issue which we should be informed about possible changes so that we have time to voice our opinion prior to the decisions being made on our behalf i 'm too isn 't up to the counselor to actually come and ask the community what they would like done with their rights money rather than the other way around how many of those set here in the last meeting decided to change the pool hours how many of you have actually been to the pools or Turangi and have a vested interest in keeping the pool our eyes open it 's very precious of you all to say that there 's not enough money or interest in the pool but I mean you 're spending X amount on a sea bass upgrade we see that down in Turangi to when none of you except a Maggie behind me here who took the time out to come and actually see the pool yesterday morning and how many people are using us after the exercise class was over there were at least 30 people milling around it was buzzing have any of you asked any of the patrons of the pool how it would affect them if it if it was closed in the mornings I don 't think anybody 's actually asked us how can you sit there and represent Turangi when you don 't have any idea what we want because you never asked us other communities managed to have pools that are open six in the morning and close nine at night so that workers have access before and after work these times were better would injuries or problems with pain as already outlined is important for the important to use the poor in the mornings to get your body working at the last meeting when a patron outlined how the poor benefited her ailments a counselor and a counselors direct reaction was let 's take the emotion out of this issue but my answer to that is there are many of us who have issues with spines joints arthritis obesity diabetes heart disease and I could go on when these issues are your own it takes over your whole life it 's more than an emotional issue because besides drugs the poor is the only relief that you can look forward to thank you for trying the opening hours because it 's made me realize how beneficial the water therapy is please don 't take away that from us those people who need it the most what I would like to pose as one question how often is the Paul used in the afternoons as an opposite as offering another solution and by whom morning openings are preferable to most of us who have Thank You Julian Ian you 've actually got a couple of minutes left but if anybody else want to comment solely on pool else you 're more than welcome that 's what standing orders allows for only on the pool hours are you on pull hours I was at the pool yesterday and it 's not the first time I 've been to the pole actually went to fill the jug cuz the senior sets hall had no water and I couldn 't have coffee but I also wanted to see what was happening in the morning because i usually go in the afternoon with my grandchildren there were so many people in the poll that was amazing and it was from the people doing the exercise classes to the little people with their mums and mums little pepper active in the mornings little people want to go and do stuff so the mums utilize the pool in the morning as well for the small people and the scores use it during the other times and after school it 's still bubbling my office at the CA B is right morning that i 'm at work and it 's full of people going to the pool it 's just something that we really need and the more its open and the more it 's utilized the better the offset of funding will be we can advertise it properly when we 've got the solid areas that we need and we really need those hours and so it will come even more than it is now the pool is already doing more in its own funding then we anticipated and that can grow and it won 't grow if the pools aren 't open because people we 'll get fit up and not know when they 're open and it will go down instead of up thank you thank you very much Maggie Stuart I can feel your passion from here _"

    "text": "now the second presentation we have today is from town centre taupo who are here yeah I didn 't go back there so tempting to tap our a self-funded group by the ratepayers of town centre they have a targeted rate in taupo which funds tempting to tap out to do all sorts of things to enhance and and great town center so that 's the presentation that you 're going to be hearing today folks give it to you good selves I 'll start off good afternoon everyone my name is during Newton for those I haven 't_''_58.829 met yet I 'm the chairman of the Senate committee siamese surely who is GM at the moment filling and why Tilly is away on maternity leave we 've just recently realized that position because tellings not coming back and turns in the Talpiot represents approximately 200 and 300 520 members all inside the CBD of trp which is outlined on the met they 're all the businesses inside that boundary members and a compulsory membership and the right for that is collected by the council on their behalf there is associate member but there comes with no voting rights and the board is made up of seven elected members from businesses inside the CBD as I mean Tim funding the funding comes mainly from a targeted rate of two hundred and fifty nine dollars it 's clicked on our behalf by the council and the rights and just a couple things to note there and we actually went back to our budget al funding and collected in 2010 2011 was two hundred fifty dollars so we 've hit a total increase in the last three years of nine dollars I think that orders free conscious of effect that times are very tough out there for everybody particularly retailers in that area so we 've tried to do more worthless and be a 30-percent of funding comes through sponsorship this and the likes of naming rights for some of the events we do the business awards that we 'll talk about later we have knowing rights with the beans in pink Center cave his naming rights of trust pair so we actively go out and try and get as much funding tampo we are there to promote the vibrancy and growth of the CBD and the CBD only it 's the cvd that fund us and we are there to make sure that the tents in STO stays vibrant and next mission is to be a voice for our members on the board that is coming back to council on their behalf Nick strategy was to encourage and support the beautification of the cvd and obviously recently council just funded the beautification a few street this has been a great asset to our town center and lastly we not i think we partner with destination lake taupo to help promote and tempo outside the district and more importantly the CBD and those promotions the other things that we get involved in is that we are the champions of customer services we have a monthly customer key reward which is advertised voted in the paper and on the radio this is just a try and increase customer service in the CBD now the next or pass over to George to just run through the business awards which are coming up and the is to be the convener of the beans at great lakes football business awards and this year we made some major changes all of the awards are open to businesses district-wide so that was advertised from 19 03 total than the two ringing we also changed to having categories because we thought if we 're going to ask businesses to put a lot of time into entering the awards and need to come away with the trophy that they can feel really proud of so we went for industry based titles so we had our usual sort of standard titles such as retail hospitality service trade and then two new categories which we 've never had before first being tourism we all can understand why that would be important in our region that we want to celebrate tourism excellence and professional services and they were an industry that we 're really crying out to be part of the awards and everybody embraced it we still have one customer service award because we do know that customer service is hugely important we wanted to take the focus away from just providing we don 't want our businesses falling away so we still have one customer service award and we have done in mystery shops as part of the whole program businesses awards are collaborative effort between the Chamber of Commerce and town center turbo we have a subcommittee and we have members from each that meet weekly to decide where we 're going to head and this year one of our biggest changes that went along with the new categories was running workshops instead of seminars so the workshops would sessions where people came with iPads pens paper and we 're actually taking notes on how to write their business plans to submit in their application and the amazing part is it in the past we 've had a decent number of people coming along but we 've actually doubled the number of people coming along by actually making people work so obviously our business out there want to put the effort in they wanted us to help show them how to do that and they 've come along and really taking part in everything we were doing so we think to be always an employment seriously am a huge thank you to the council for their ongoing support of counseling to taupo i know that we didn 't quite get it right with our presentation today and your plan this year but we 've certainly learned from our mistakes and put things in place that that won 't happen again and what we just wanted to do three council what we do with your money and what we plan to do with it over the next coming year in the past that money had been tagged for a an assistant administration person for several reasons we haven 't needed that person over the last year and so what we 've done is we 've used that money in different ways and I just like to run through how we have made use of that money and going forward we feel this is probably the best use of councils money the board discussed this at length and we feel that would should be responsible for its own administration costs not the council so what we see this the money should be the sort of things that we can put a tangible integral ticket to the first thing we did back in October last year the TCT took over the management of the public spaces that is the administration of all the busking licenses on behalf of the council and it has proven to be quite a big job probably bigger than we realize when we were offered it but I think it 's good for us because then we can manage those spaces to the benefit every hour and members I think I 've got to figure in front of me to date we have process 59 buskers license since October last year each one of those sort of taken in excess of half now too narrow Gorge twine the main thing we use the money for like i said is town vibrancy you may or may not know that the tenants in the Talpiot is responsible for most of those things we SAT there the center cave there 's run each year by the 1010 to tell who I think will be on us we wouldn 't have a center up last year we started at a new event which was spaced around Halloween it was an amazing success and saw literally hundreds if not thousands of kids in town picking up sweets from dearest various retailers for about women there Chris can probably correct me about four or five years ago started running in winter fest it was a half day event I suppose the ultimate goal is to sort of have something the same as queenstown his we 're probably a little shy that at the moment but last year it got out to about a four or five-day event starting on the Wednesday before the weekend running right through to the trolley Derby on the sunday big one for Chancellor to helping tracking the snow down from the mountain very well received by the public those sort of events fall slightly outside our mandate because they start falling under a community good rather than a retail good and that 's why we feel that the use of the council money for those sorts of means is the right place to use it and we also have activities their acronym rak is random acts of kindness and the likes of I don 't know if any of the females with downtown at Mother 's Day but we employed a couple of students from coral tipping no idea a capella singing group when ran town and gave out flowers to all the mothers on Mother 's Day just a nice random act of kindness feel good we want people to feel good about coming to trp we 're also heavily involved and trying to get buskers around town during our key periods of tourism in taupo it 's about it does anybody giving Erica 's Julie lovely presentation thank you very much something just sprung to my mind that maybe I 'd assist you these flowers you gave out at Mother 's Day did you have to buy them we did we brought you ring the 500 players you ring the call the boss of the prison governor of if you ring the governor of the Tungri of prison down he 's always asking me every day just about they 've turned it into a working prison what jobs ring they 've got glass houses down there and you give the seeds they 'll grow them for you brilliant idea and I suppose we need to contact from this time of year so they 've got corn or give you their email address you I 'd just tell them I told you to email but they 're looking for work guys down there growing vegetables at the moment for the food banks both to ring in Taupo you 're growing native trees for doc they 're building traps to catch possums and rodents and things so more week they can get down there the happier they they will be beautiful will do if we go there thank you all over the floor up I put my counselors to have any questions I know they 're all wanting to congratulate you on the work you do because something that 's very dear to all our hearts keeping our talent into vibrant and exciting and businesses afloat I know it 's been tough times for everybody um any questions of anybody cuz I 'd come to Johnson well after the big saturday there 's snow right down to the chateau so hopefully so long as it doesn 't disappear we will the plan is to replicate most of all we had last year which is the Baron emotes the dog sleeps we 'll be back down there the sledging will be bigger and better we have you would have seen ever twice and the paper why Ricky have come on board with a inaugural midwinter ball which is heading to deepen the only thing we have dropped this year as a trolley Derby it sort of peaked two years ago and has been on a decline apart from the local in one that wins each year this real competition it 's just a fly counter crepe Rodin kanika assistant appraisal on to things that that happened in air train IAM ones freedom camping in the vehicles the other ones who used to be an appraisal and i proposed project i can speak about he straight because i was working with different there 's always some mixed feeling that comes out of the differences down there in general I think people are of it I think a little bit of adjustments and space and when different car parks are probably the only negative feedback I 've received is that we need to do more with that open space on Kiki street and and I can say they 've looking the effort I 've put in so far it takes a lot of time to source not just have the ideas but then source what you 've been there we in a pundit bum but it 's absolutely the top of our list of spaces that we need to do something is incredible and then do put something called the feedback from anyone coming through and it does draw people freedom camping just on those open spaces we have got a couple of things that were doing in the near future then next couple weeks were purchasing a large noughts and crosses type activity the same as you test course and we one of the retailers will put that in and out just to try and fill up that space the other quicker idea we 've got is were purchasing a piano we randomly play the piano and I want to bits and then we 'll throw it away and what we 're looking at is quirky things like that the activities to fill in the space between the organized displays down there we have to be very careful that we don 't put displays down there that conflict with retailers that are there so it is a bit of an awkward one we 've talked about having and an expert or three times ear for our tourism operators it 's on the cards still in the near future freedom camping once again I suppose anything that brings retailer customers into the retail space is good for our businesses whether that on the lakefront is the right place that 's up to the council to the side any other questions good because we did not get any application from my geeky no we did have businesses from manga keynote taking part in workshops when the end did not turn in application i can say that feedback from businesses who decided not to apply was usually around the fact that they learned so much that they didn 't realize they had that they felt that this year was going to be a working year for them and next year that they would buy again so we 've had two businesses from tutoring turn in applications direction I 've got one last one have you taken over the Christmas parade what 's happening with our Christmas right we got a bit of a speed wobble as I believe a wiki year or two ago last year we didn 't even have the nobody even booked the recall the sideshow things for the park you know the merry-go-round some things like that we did get a good turnout because we all got on the radio and racked everybody up but um I 've been a Libra sign is the one who runs the parade and we did meet with him the committee to try and assist in management of been made and the after brain function let 's just say that didn 't go well our efforts weren 't well received so we had to try and build in what we could around his efforts I perspective that has a private person he owns the parade and manages the frayed and doesn 't want us to do anything more sort of told we couldn 't put anything on a domain you couldn 't have any activities so that is a big question marking something that 's listener well I 'm not too sure either i 'm a bit i 'm in a doctor that as well as you are and you 've raised some very pertinent points and i hope i have to but yeah the last couple of years the christmas parade has almost died the wonderful bit of wind i shouldn 't use that one but at my age but um you know it does me bolstering and i don 't know mr. Weiner 's can we can simplify a system perhaps anything or what situation are we must equipment breaks I think it 's a very important part of the embankment and we have been trying to and will continue to try to we were part of those discussions with Julie as well at that stage and you will continue to try and it bigger and better but way that it has been set up in the past is that basically is a privately owned of it but we do own the road end and the North the main I believe ok we 're on behalf of the counselors here thank you very much for your presentation keep up the good work I only hear good things from the people who fund you say must be good thank you very much Thank You Julie and Derek are the resolution sorry that the information relating to Townsend to taupo be received and they 're terrific delivery sincerely think for the presentation move a piece move cancel Johnson seeking the council heckling all in favor aye thank you very much _"

    "text": "just about him and mr. Carroll I noticed about it looks like he 's exiting pages right mr. Carroll 's coming up to eloquently answer questions like he does so does anybody have any questions of clarity how would you like to extrapolate on anything here for counselors to point out to them just in case they hadn 't seen whatever any diseases very much mechanical item it 's the young it 's the last rubber stamping what is terribly long plan making process so um we started this way back in the last train him I think from memory what is 24 and 25 have essentially been around for about 12 years almost as old as me here you go mover I 'll move take encounter trim and all those in favor by Herod do you know number I team sorry item number 14 southern statement that 's your plan adoption you 'd like to speak to the full council hip lingo I know you very able echada and robe it thank you your worship um is to to documents as an attachment the earrings committee report and recommendation is just some some typos which I 'm assured will be corrected before the final document goes out to the general public and with with that in mind I would like to move the council adopt the amended southern structure plan or for its go to the gentleman being adopted the policy knows you 're a seconder for this the month ago billet was on the hearing cancelling imbecile all those in favor any fear the questions of clarity etc ah yeah you were supposed to that 's right my apologies the suggested additional resolution should have read or can still read that the chivas exotic also be authorized to make minor amendments the southern settlement structure meant to correct typography errors and update references say you were the mover and come to the end of someone 's taken man well there 's a favor to that two parts all right Oh carried you know item number fifteen as the proposal one or two or three around New Zeeland at the moment for local government reorganisation for the Hawke 's Bay region who have started a process we have a of our land out towards the lowlands out towards white paper on what have you so um who 's going to oh sorry this may be how are you I feel up miss mabel i 'll hand over to you my friend I 'll just summarize that there was an application back in March from a better Hawke 's Bay to be organized local government in Hawke 's Bay and that was notified for alternative proposals so we held the council workshop on the twenty-third of April to discuss the proposal and determine whether the Council wishes to submit an alternative proposal council decided it didn 't but wish to submit some comments to the local government Commission and those are attached unfortunately due to the timing issues of that closing it wasn 't able to come to cancel any questions of over time we get a we don 't get a we haven 't had a reply but the next stage of the process is the local government Commission comes up with a draft proposal which it has to consult with local authorities that are affected with it will that 's the important you see we 're going to get told anyway we then have the opportunity to submit on that we covered this briefly last Friday when somebody anywhere starts the process the we all get dragged into it and we have to go along with the process explained to us very well last Friday in our case and the Bay of Plenty highly likely that either the team 's coromandel District Council or the poverty Council will be firing the first bullet that will put us all in the the melting pot you 're wonderful bit of wood and what will be will be so it is no more questions or anything for I 'm sorry we because William there any indication or in any do you have any information regarding you need the repairs that are affected by this as to whether they 're submitted no no one has got back to me I 've sent a lot of information out and no one 's got back to me I think the next stage is to actually formally right to the right pose to explain to back very interesting just as an aside in the Hawke 's Bay Local Government Reform that their rum real realization that they 're pushing for that there 's been two to three hundred thousand dollars of full-page newspaper ads paid by private people as your own pocket that 's how determined they are in my opinion to push two three implement will also be interesting to know even though I know you haven 't had any feedback whether those farms because they are farms that are any our district have had any consultation whatsoever because you know we 've had a long dry hot summer you know if droughts and the farmers probably you know too busy one to actually make a submission and to the SOB interesting to find out whether they had been consulted you know I don 't think we did yes that assured us that they 've done a big ring around and contacted sixty to eighty percent of that land owners out there that we 're still contemplating it was the first I 'd heard about it gonna be at our staff I 'm talking spoke to hadn 't meant most of them hadn 't heard about it or if they had they hadn 't been contacted directly I mean it 's by the mmm yeah but yeah I did not buy us we contacted them to make sure that we still wanted to know what they wanted to you know go stick on the foot Council Johnson or as a favor carried just to rob goals research agenda item number 16 now there is a addendum that Rob has sent out along with us I most of you have got it Shane is gets another copy if you want them to the environment court mediations Godfrey thank you worship and but just take you back to nineteen thirteen what you just did those fan changes that 's the final step and getting any plan approved and it 's your job just did it what the Environment Court is proposing is that edits mediations you will have to send somebody along with full authority to come to final settlement agreements effectively what that will mean is that you will have no choice when you come it so when you say somewhat in somebody along some team along well you you could start from sending the whole council along to the mediation you can in the council is empowered to delegate down to a council committee so you can see in the committee along to the mediations that management management support but the council does not have the power to delegate that that power to council offices in recife counselors from here can go take two or three senior managers but they 're compelled to make a decision on the day yes so what that 's in respect of district plans in respect of resource consents The Situation 's a little bit easier because you can delegate that as far down as officers and was there more the list policy decisions so the argument the question for you today counselors is whether you want to send a submission to the court saying you don 't agree or you agree with the proposal which is to basically require you to send at all mediations to send along fully authorized people who can make a decision that binds has been ever since the RMA came in was that councils come along to these mediations generally officers go along they are fully given instructions by the council to go as far as they can but they will generally be required to come back to the council for the final sign-off because there 's we all know at mediations things come out of their field things come out of the woodwork but you haven 't anticipated and count the general practice to date has been get as far as you can come back to a council for the final two quarters signaling that that is no longer acceptable to the court for reasons that haven 't been fully explained but have to do with backwards and forwards and mediations taking longer than they then they should so well then the court thinks they should so that 's that that 's the question largely if if we just let this thing go through what will happen is that if we add if you or a future council and prepared to send along fully authorized representatives and respective district plan changes that the day at mediation don 't come back to anybody then we will essentially be told to our mediations off and that means we go right to hearing more expense shelter down over so i 'll take a question or a minute i know mr. greens busting to say something here you 're not i gots what you had to a clarity for its ok come to dinner unbelievable you know because as you said there 's not be no real good reason why they 'd have it the only kind of reason that you can come to a conclusion is that they want to speed it up and don 't want the hassle that coming bouncing back but obviously when it goes to Environment Court that 's of some controversy and why should that be burdened put be put on for three councillors or three senior staff to suddenly make a decision and an environment that might not be too nice because mediation isn 't a very nice environment there 's a lot of pressure put on those and it just made clear this is the mediation phase when makes the decision the court can order you to do what the call 12 this is the mediation phase which as miss Carol just said to you we 're heading into for the current plan appeals you 're confident what we haven 't really had we haven 't really got much of an option every instability because we either don 't be part of mediation which could be a less include cost to our ratepayers doesn 't go straight to Environment Court so we have to go get on that law in don 't we can I just tell you what potentially some other councils are doing some other councils have indicated this is only anecdotally to me they 've indicated the last around they 're just going to live with it they will send officers along to mediations ostensibly with power to completely settle but not actually with that power when it comes to the point where they run out of their delegated power they 'll say sorry the council decides not to sever mediation will finish and then there 'll be attempts at negotiations around the back to could take and essentially to tell the court one thing and do something else but my recommendation is based on we should front up and and make a submission to the court whether the court accepts that or not as of course after the court we should make a submission to point out the issue firstly I think it 's quite clever to send these staff along with delegation so make it to a stage where they just have to walk away because they 're for an out of delegation because the opposition then just think you can 't give a settlement or maybe we should have accepted it or maybe we will accept it I 'm not that I give it I take on board what comes to download thing as well I think it 's a mechanical item that you just have to like it or lump it wrong to be to be clear myself what the submission says is different deal for and since then for plain appeals plan Appeals Council on suggesting run with it run with their suggestion for consent appeals but not but raised but you answered my first question which was the edgy council 's position and I kind of except I think we do need to flag out our point of view by falling the submission move the resolution fine move take it back that 's what Kirk all in favor carry too much sleep thank you others at school okay moving now to agenda item number 17 lake taupo protection trust me i think you all know from the media and at it receptor that that it 's very desirous of the lake taupo petites and trust members but in particular I 'm to get this project finished by this election I have your favorite nearly nice yet ghost if we will do shortly a ghost right um so um sorry think gonna owe me um it took quite some time to get the government to come to the table to pick up their share of the responsibility i think it was comforting interesting can correct me i think we had to get to 183 tons was the actual end result the in scientific at the end of the science and our funding partner work at a regional council and their rate payers and of course taba district council and its ratepayers this is really a mechanical item for you to review the the funding deed draft and as i said we hope to release that release that money to the lake toba protection trust and they in turn of which come to henderson myself members wish to have this project completed before the end of this triennium which will be which will have removed 183 tons of nitrogen from the lake tahoe great lake football so it 's all fairly self-explanatory what 's happening here we will see a foolishness on the so what we 're in fact doing is that we 're paying our normal annual payment that were also paying releasing 2.8 26 million out of reserves to enable the lump sum to be paid which means that will after this year will only have one more year of rape targeted rate collection and then the lake taupo protection trust targeted rate will disappear I should you know we 've been building these reserves up because it 's then the government have put over time had to be equal partnerships they 've come to the table we want to release that money lake will be finished its project and a rating agata Great Wolf cease I do next year is no no jun 15 jun 15 you 'll see there disappear from your rates book there is a loo r 1 and 2 on page 1 of agenda item number 17 and of this same same resolution yeah okay turn to page five if you like at the end I just have to conclusions same two resolutions so is the remover please move council henderson taken back to download all those a favor hi so moved thank you very much for them to Lake Taupo protection trust council engagements the gym item number 18 will do these two issues here then we 'll break for my copper and go into conference so anybody have any changes or anything to those dates up here we do have a citizenship ceremony on

Trevor about that there 's no timelines associated with us in terms of it must be done this month or next month and mr. traveler has accepted that as we have discussed this yet appreciate it 's just informational stuff Williams what were the questions you 'll miss as I understand it the some contact that seat also is this kind of don 't know it 's still settled on Friday where we settled this friday and this issue is not related to the settlement of the country there 's no timelines associated with the access part of it it 's just kept under obligation of counsel to to take best endeavours to sort this matter out but there 's no timeline associated with that and it 's not critical to the continuation of the project it 's an agenda item today and I don 't really understand what 's going on here could we move that to the confidential section discuss what the matters are on there is there possible bid it to next month 's agenda meeting and which dusted open council at next month 's monthly minute and this contract closes on friday though it 's complex closed it thinks it 'll don 't try and find problems it has no problems I have deferred it we are now moving to agenda to clarify what the issues are you worship that 's all we haven 't got clarification otherwise we will be discussing today and that 's what we are seeking of gbg officer is clarifications right we won 't get there till the next council meeting us at Crete ok so the reporters attached with the rooms is happy to take wishes but that 's only up to will move to the financial update after this brief come to Henderson I mean fair can ferry end this so she was brought up earlier I 'm counselors requested a time line at a pretty high level for stage 2 and 3 of the Turing II revitalization I know that nothing in this reporters mentioned any further about that so if we could have a verbal update as to when we might be able to expect or see that information that we appreciated mr. Bowden stana backtick comforter if you can put some clarity where and counselor Henderson so weary please with pleasure we 're working through the design for the stage two and three at the moment an integral part it stays 't_''_958.71 we 've contracted the designer of the skipper we 've not got what i consider to be a reasonable program four me Mia so we 're putting that together at the moment I 'm not going to put anything on paper that we can 't that I 'm not happy we can stick to and deliver so that timeline will come out next month you cannot answer counselor Henderson query as to what the timelines are because you don 't know the timelines cool thank you anything for the counselor Henderson I 'm sorry Kelso Headley hungry just mention the going to the design stages escape or who we get in to do that at work so because it 's really important that skateboarders ever I was sort of an input into that into that design counselor the there 's been consultation with the community in two Runge with regards to their requirements runescape that 's happened I think it was last year the end of Russia so there 's been a concept put forward by a comical premium scared designs rather good experience of doing them in New 've done in the past so that that part of the process is complete ok so now we 're going to go concept the concept and Roran kill usha enter detailed adjoins structural design and building consent at the moment we want to just come back to them and we 're working through that process of design and we 've had a tentative program which I 'm not very happy with at the moment so I 'm trying to nail them down to some more specific dates so i can give to cancel a program that is realistic and not just the thumbs there was just the design concept and yeah we 've got a detailed consultation process into your wish up to three sets of his hung around though j mays agreement j mas over the waking a river I was forgets to the tiara what could you want I 'm go I 'm throw onto the performance not be I know we do chief I think it as you put some atlanta 12 at 212 bass free that 's right anything more for mr. Bowden else we could a stout of interest and the performance major targets and talked about on 12 x 3 there a couple it seems we have largely been achieved but there is a few slippage is there and it says that and they 'd be detailed explanation is with detailed explanations and the report I haven 't found though so I 'm just wondering if I 'm not reading it properly or or what story is because when I look at it the Beckett they 're different on track long-term plan exit row it still just got the same brief explanations that 'll be fantastic to hear sorry contra Derek just on the surge spells miss Williams did we get any young was anything from Waikato regional councils we get but we did over at mega keno will see or any come back from them no because appropriate process was followed to the explanation report in monitoring from okay so yes a resolution chief executive officers report form a they didn 't be received move Johnson second down at all in favor I 've got ahead of myself there because so I want the financial fraud by five and rights through to where do we in there could we just till 12 17 can we do that page by page if there 's any questions I would remind councils that mr. me and him it has asked many many times if you 've got questions on the financials in any way shape or form no matter how big or small if you could email them freedom before a meeting here will always have those answers ready at our meeting if you received any question queries no I haven 't but I 'd like to draw 2-2 council 's attention that this is the first month that we 've done a year in forecast what we intend doing now is getting very much into a forecasting mode to try and protect where we 're going to be at the end of each year so hints and the 13 14 year you 'll start to see this coming through Wrigley on on a monthly basis there 's two reasons for this one is that we have to do our full-year budget so far in advance is one year before we budget for the next but secondly as we try and have our staff focusing more on the future and not the past it assists us an hour forward planning is to the activities that we undertake so we look at the page 12 by five you 'll see the year in forecast is painting a three and a half million dollar favorable variance first what the original budget was there is variances pretty line by line the gains losses we 've brought in the projected sale proceeds of the Douglas fir up and above what the written that book value was because we get it revalued each year and in the expenses you 'll find that there 's the 4.2 million with anticipated council will consider it an item number 17 and today 's agenda related to the late detection our payment so even taking those into account you can see that the actions of the staff have turned out to lead to a pretty positive result in forecastle year and actions of councillors as well of course it is becoming more and more often be really let there 's step to get a lot of good stories are in these financials finance costs 791 thousand dollars less than budget due to lower than budgeted debt levels so our debt reducing program is starting to take effect good stories about budgets even Owen delaney park big windfall we had to end up fifty three thousand dollars in credit as all those sort of things add up to like eating the OL elephant bite at a time but three million i think is the zipless increase yet a reduction in the deficit by over three million dollar million and our line book at the end of eighth full as 10 million lists of what we were budgeting you know there are good news stories out there and I just hope that the media does carry them forward so there was a request of one council I 've been told capture Truman made a request of a chief executive officer for some clarity on some issue so I just wanted to clarify get there was an email read pleasure the question was about budgets you see the over the 75 respect 262 thousand dollars this year 229 hours were spent on the seal extension of a techie right 31 pairs of spent only retaining the battle an Irishman which was magical express the extension project extension project there 's a balance of a homing pigeon pairs in which you intended to be carried forward the venture to help take this and that will take place in next maybe a little bit later cause I don 't do a ceiling till the summer heads however okay shelter Henderson I 'm just picking up on the financial reports treasury management port page twelve bar 13 just draw people 's attention to 22 charts that one as the investment returns and the other one is the interest costs on debt and the reason why i want to point this out is there 's been a lot of commentary from the public about selling investment assets it would seem firstly that the investment returns are well ahead of forecasts are doing pretty well and the other issue is that the cost of debt or the deed itself and clearly the interest always another good thing as well i think just can consider in the comments have been made by a lot of members of the public around those two issues there are a couple of really positive things to highlight one other comment i 'd like to make is on the capital xfinity report we will be moving into the forecasting mode on that as well trying to predict what our capital expenditure will be on each of these projects our year-end not just one into a year-end on every year in one month away well the next year it 'll be forecasting to the ten we live among hear anything fear up on this I will move into their mistake I 'm sorry God 's well if you wish I just like to try her comment on the other revenues obviously grant subsidies to be ahead of budget by 1.89 and also on other expenses that 's very very good even though this is a few timing issues here at 1.5 to 3 above ahead of budget is a great news for the ratepayers well done officers especially you don sorry ever other Scouts to the uncomf rum hey and coastal countries on autumn so uncle 's in there on Delaney logs or something mention transport recoveries it 's all good news report that 's very pleasant pleasing heading into winter I 'm moving to the project performance section of this agenda item which takes you right through move into that one any questions or cancer hoechlin yeah I just like to make a comment once again on Becca me on the sorry on page 12 bar 21 upgrade of c 'mon away Street changing facility and toilets and the comments here are that it has gone out to tender and the required some tional funds and it would be requested through the annual plan process I actually bought this up at the annual plan process and it was told because we hadn 't got a submission it couldn 't be dealt with under the annual plan process so why is it saying it supposed to be under the onion plants the timing issue in terms of witness report was collated versus with me and your plan was so this but let 's cut to them it 's cut to the chase counselor heckling what 's these buildings built over here cricket people were basically promised it so where are we and what are we doing about it because it 's been out pretender and I believe that hinder is I think what we said was we would bring a paper to the next council meeting with a request for and budgeted expenditure is that arranged that 's as we said that 's what we said in the only place we wanted clarity yeah and that 's what was said at the at the meeting emienem and I am opposed to that because this projects been in the in the long-term plan for about five years and unfortunately if if that report comes to cancel I 'll be obliged to vote against it because some budgeted item and it 's almost the first month of the new financial year we actually have unspent budget of expenditure aim if you think of the tenders and that that come across will come through this chamber where the actual tender cost is below engineer 's estimate so therefore in this particular case the estimate was less than what the tender price was others have come through where the tender price has been less than the engineer 's estimate so we do actually have budgeted unspent kept it not particularly to find in our plans for the comment 0 reserve but in this case where the key under price has come ahead of the estimate we will fund the wrist out of budgeted Catholics that have been unspent the date so it is not unbudgeted kathy 's will have no rate than peg Thank You mr. mem Anna for that explanation though and I appreciate those comments am I too I feel conflicted so my to understand that we 're doing the job are we is the winds of fatty wall some clarity because this gets bounced around all the time and I don 't know what we 're actually doing now I 've been told what we 're doing I thought of no wins to who we stopped them to do is that I can 't give you an exact time frame because discussed earlier this week up in two days ago so we store not in a place of you exact time frame but it will be as soon as possible I think in furness mr. chair has to come back to the next council meeting for approval voting against it because with the wording is very weird and had it weird in that 's just been put forward you worship I would obviously might vote for it but yeah where are you satisfied with what we 've just added today I 'm very satisfied with our menator deafness will be an agenda item its council meeting thank you very much counter downer well I 'm happy with that thing because I to have been part of the process and we were told in a workshop that we could find the money somewhere and then it came through the annual plan and that we didn 't so that 's why council airplane has brought it up again today so it 's all fixed and we have got that out of budgeted in yeah that 's great Williams yeah just just really wanting wacky new rubber because we we did put some time and last year with the tiara chessboard and and now the two mary trust boards come and we 've got a um we 've got a comment here that councils received advice from those parties the meters have been resolved when the meters have been resolved the agreement can be adopted for just a question around the timeline of those j j mas both with tiara and the raw power River River trust and eNOS the second one was just to explain the process with regards to the pain changes on the appeals just just really wanted to know the timing issues Leah pain changes tweety 82 gracious first one hand over to you I 'll take both of them and do course firstly the sake of a nice job Gia well you double thank you worship good advice row cameras going well we 've had the initial meeting of the joint management committee which started the ball rolling and we 've had several officer meetings we 've discussed the draft document that is on target to be adopted by anticipating bringing a draft up to counsel at the end of August meeting in terms of natty 240 tire they 've sent an initial signal that they want to develop the joint management agreement with us the ball is firmly in their court at this point in time we 've asked them for some indication around timing and process that they 'd like to follow so we 're waiting to hear back from them in that regard in terms of Tara tiara you 'll remember you 've got a draft sitting on the table which has been if some time I talked to them yesterday they 've been in discussions with knows you to protoid you 're being very fruitful they are looking to expand those discussions and bring row cower and as well we 've got a slightly tricky situation which doesn 't occur in other parts of the Waikato where we 've got away with overlapping interests there is a particular area where r 0 Calliphora and to photo all have interests and the legislation so dear discussions are aimed at having an understanding amongst themselves about how had an indication they 'll be coming back to us some stage in the next few months with an update about what progress they 've made do I get to go on to the second one yep that was water in terms of plan changes 2833 we 've had the five Appeals which I think I 've talked to you about before we 've made an initial report to the court setting out a structure for managing those appeals we 've also had discussions with all of the appellants the five appellants the three different areas of interest three different topics are on three different sort of paths we 've had a very clear indication from the National trading company and advanced properties that they wish to proceed straight to court assistive mediation so ever we 've asked the court for a date to be sit down and immediate to be provided the Acacia trustees who we 've met with have indicated they 're quite heavy to move forward in discussions outside of the court assisted mediation process we 've already initiated those and we 'll be meeting with the track is the kth d submission I sorry appellants so that 's Matt Jensen and see us in properties we 've met with them again and we 've met with all of the 274 pays involved the vet they 've got a very wide scope to their appeals at present which means there are a whole lot of different possibilities and we could end off on all sorts of tangents we 've asked them to provide a much narrower scope to the appeal so we can focus our energy and our resources arguing about the points where there might be some difference as opposed to trawling over common ground the event taken to come back to us by the sims of july with narrowing of their scope and will have further discussions at that point about where we think that we can find some common ground the next step after that will be a discussion probably through a more formal mediation process assisted by the courts mediator I guess the last piece of their puzzle is we 've undertaken to respond back to the court on the fourteenth of June different tracks well answered thank you very much anything further nothing further on the agenda item in Totem executive summary I think I actually asked remove on a second originally and did I we did so we 'll moved out to agenda item number what we should wait just a question probably a paraffin income 12 bar 45 just the looks as though we 're saying we 're supposed to inspect the liquor outlets and the food outlets one hundred percent per annum yeah those and I know this is a march and of March isn 't it but are we going to achieve the hundred percent there or we 're putting the pressure on the staff to meet the hundred percent yeah which has the people who and we will make sure that well I just you know as we 've only got basically four months I seem to to do the remainder that 's why I 've got shut toed shoes on it won 't thank you so anybody will the liquor outlet bit of the watch themselves the mix three months because you 're going to get Williams regard to the toe incidents absurd spells has been any precautionary measures put in place to avoid future problems as a consequence of those green and they were both and was trying to find the page number 56 they were both issues which occurred essentially with them with they were they were not as a result of any maintenance issue or or lack of action they were they were simply excellent switch our food so so there 's really nothing other than our ongoing maintenance program s image of a program that we have they 've done they can point place to reduce their from happiness one of those things I think they 're that come to innocent um yeah just two issues the first one is on page 12 bar 26 the Turing a wastewater treatment plant optimization um just foreign council 's attention to it that there 's 1.2 million dollars proposed for a new lined pond and nine hundred thousand dollars budgeted for a chemical cleaning plan and 950,000 for a membrane capacity expansion probably not required just for your information it also points out cost the most significant risk reason i pointed out as we 've already got a huge investment in this plant and here we are spending more money on it and costs and as being identified as the biggest risk so i would just pay attention to what 's going on there because it seems like a lot of money or a plant we 've already invested a significant the other one is the Turangi revitalization project 12 power 20 live just just a couple of points with um mmm the I note that just for councils and formations they may not see the landscaping tender price is twice the provisional some allowed on the contract and that it appears that will be coming to Council for approval to take the money for that from stage two of the project to make up the shortfall so just a couple of things to point out that people may not have seen their only no it 's not really questions they 're just go to bed an explanation on both Lee I know that it wasn 't it the telecon cabled it and shifting explanations not necessarily here though for the public as to why that 's happened and just pointing out that the cost will be twice as much which until now I don 't that we we 're aware of any simple and smooth being nothing moving to agenda item number 13 please _"

    "text": "the agenda around my apologies for doing so but presentation from bike top o annual report please see mr. set that as the team leader here we grow don 't you work you worship counselors reason to we 're here today is essentially just to I guess update the council is one of our key stone funders is what we 've been up to for the past 12 months to apologize it as a wee bit late but we thought as an opportune time to come and get in front of the council so we 're prepared a brief presentation which will speak to and hopefully get through that worth any time for questions afterwards I would also like to acknowledge those other members of the committee staff and supporters who have turned up today and support as well which is good to say um so just glee over what we 're going to be covering today just if you 're no introduction of who we are what we look like now cuz we have changed to leave it how we 're funded and what we do with us funding who is bike taupo a lot of this you 've seen before within the context of our submissions and past presentations obviously elke role is to advocate for cycling in the top or district as well as that we build tracks that we like to write on at the same time and like to get as many people into cycling as possible and you 've got the presentation so if you want to go over that again so what do we look like we 've got a we 've got a tiered committee structure which is evolving to meet the growing demands and priorities which been placed on bike topol these days we 've recently restructured our committee to ensure that we 're in the bishop to meet those growing demands so we are a growing organization and we need to make sure that we are staying edgell to meet those expectations as well that 's a photo of our exec committee so we 're got a range of ribs in a range of cycling interests and skills etc which you 'll try and bring to the table to maintain maintain the world class outputs which we seem to be delivering at the moment of current structure as you can see we 've got a series of subcommittees which report back to the exec committee we 've also got an Operations arm which is led by our operations manager mr. Peter masters who 's sitting behind me here and I 've got two different teams working underneath them one of them has focused on the build of the great lake trail the other is that the top or tracks we 've also as a result of some additional funding got an admin support person whose role is to secure further funding menos on Val kids on bikes programs keep up with all the UM communications at we 've got going at moment as well so how we fund it obviously topo district council provides a large amount of funding for us each year New Zealand cycleways who are the biggest funder at the moment because our funding the great lake trial billed to the tune of 2.3 million dollars of conservation provides us some funding for admin and also for rotary topa wanna and comes to save the day occasionally especially after storms or instance we lose bridges or lose tracks we get donations online as well as through the donations boxes that we 've got around town so if you see any of those don 't forget to drop some cash and that 's all hell it 's all good we get a series of grants that we apply from from community from environmental from government sources which keep us going map sales for the great lake trail in for the craters in totowa and cycle tracks we 've developed a partner 's program our partners and Friends program which is a tiered approach to people supporting quite oh poor and in return they get their name and their businesses and place on our website on the tracks and in various media that goes out at the moment we 've had this go for a few months we 've got I think 1215 partners on board which Annette generally goes directly to our maintenance events we marshal events we also manage events and we get funding through that we managing concession activities on the great lake trail and getting the fees associated with them and PD labor force is cannot be understated we have got gangs at work within craters I think it 's twice a week twice a week plus we 've got a couple of other PD stuff which can operate anywhere under supervision el general um cost to run these bike tracks each year as a hundred K so that pd crew we reckon and amounts to about thirty to forty thousand dollars of work and kind we have one supervisor and the funding we get goes into that supervisor and we 've just finished a new track which has been named after them is called Beagle boys and it 's some pretty good quality work and it 's really good to see him we had a minister visit from the minister which I 'll talk about soon was also impressed by the way that were being utilized in speedy labor force so what do we do with this funding as i mentioned track maintenance is a huge part of it but obviously the great lake going on at the moment craters mountain bike park and total river trails building maintenance as a large the second i guess most financially consuming part of our work produce maps we maintain our website kids bike taupe or which is a new initiative which is partly funded by the council and also environmental enhancement programs talk to that last one briefly and because we 'll get on to the other ones soon part of our philosophy is essentially improving to places that we ride on we like to create lasting destinations or right experiences which we want to pass on to next generation so the environmental enhancement but what may feel like a fit with like type what 's a big part of what we do if you 've been to 4 Kai PO Bay recently you 'll see a whole series of brown pines which is what bike Tocqueville got funding to essentially poison all the pines in that reserve p masters spent the morning doing the same down by total gut which is behind heli seeker and we 're not sorry no Haley second hailey star and air we 've got P straps on great lake trail and we 're starting a replanting program along the rotary right as well as doing pest control as we go with the great lake trail and we 've also got another large wheatland enhancement project we want to do on final matar road which would getting funding for it one so as I mentioned too big when I big this week at moment is a great lake trial so that 's just a map of what 's being built at the moment around can lock the carp obey the calc our trek in the other coat rack which comes with long winter road we get 18 to 20,000 Reuters a year on each of these sections the new section of our co which is it comes down from Fong with a road to cargo bay as we 've had 12,000 users of that track so far this year and this is only kind of an emerging track with people standing are down so if you want to measure success we 're pretty happy with that given some of the numbers and this is the the next section of the great lake trail so what is currently built is the section from state highway 32 down to the end of why haha road and we which is getting another a lot of our use at the moment as well we 're currently building if you can see on that on the map via where it hits the lake that 's how current build site at the moment so the team is heading out by boat each day to essentially build a track upper and with a hundred meters of climb over the space of about a hundred meet a vertical over very short period so we 're basically Rock penning bridges to the side of cliffs we 're doing a lot of using a lot of the rock which is already there and constructing other tracks and again we 're not cutting any trees down which were essentially large as a net and we 're trying to work in with the environment we 're going to have about fifteen to sixteen bridges I think on that section going through waterfalls it bottom near of the build site and the photos at the top of the Y haha section which has just been completed John done who 's a tier of New Zealand so the head of the New Zealand saw buckle ways recently described it when we took motors arguably one of the best soccer trousers when in New Zealand so which is a pretty good feedback I also like to say that we have our our landing craft which goes out daily to take the builders and the track crew out and happy to invite the counselors out if they want to go on that come on a trip on that boat for a more comfortable boat it does get a bit of water on board on the topic day and we 're happy to take you around the build site take you out to kalakaua bay and show the other aspects of the of the great lake tape trail Sofia if you came and get in touch with more than heavy organize a field trip for you craters mountain bike park and also the river trails again a lot a new section we 're also rebuilding after the storm damage they 're having a March last year these are paying dividends we 're getting a lot of a really good exposure nationally and internationally attached to the handout today an article which is in last week 's Australian mounted bike magazine so four pages of you know some very good advertising for topol for why to come to token white a ride in Topal again that 's all done Julie out of community funding and developed by volunteers those are dis term with the new maps that we 've produced wee bit more advanced than our last ones and also great platform again to put our partners and supporters on there with a small on their own mate you 'll see and TDC is obviously net because that 's one of the things that TDC supports us the development of those memes near website and as I mentioned before which we 've recently developed that 's also going through another overhaul to get a better making a better platform for our partners as well as to get donations and 're looking at over the next 12 months including potentially merchandising as well one of our recent successes as kids bike topol again local district council part funds us this started and it 's been going for eight months we 've been to eight schools as well as after-school programs and sport Waikato programs this and photos they 're taking it could cope at by Kevin Dulli and those eight last eight months will paid nearly 2,000 kids on bikes again we think that successful so that 's two thousand two kids I hope to getting a better appreciation for more healthier form of transport and and recreation so type or district council funds us 28,000 per annum that wound up with three thousand dollars from last year 's our TP to fund the kids bike topol the other 25 thousand dollars that will get through a year goes mainly into trail maintenance a bit of it goes into map development and also website development and maintenance again this is like to reiterate that the system solid funding that was relied on for many years and is essentially empowered bike the last ten years of existence I just finally just some highlights of what happened last year it was a very busy last year made more so by the storm and match and the rebuild for craters working with forest managers and limbs as they harvested all the wound fell in also be Anna get in and rebuild and tidy up the tracks as I mentioned a great lake trail got greater way haha sections completed one hora section is underway we had obtained international accreditation through the international mounted bike Association so silver-level right-center accreditation is to Silver level ride centers in the world one gold level and eight right centers sorry 12 right centers all up with the only this to write centers and the hemisphere we have pages on the Ember website so we 're getting a fear whack of traffic through that which is coming directly to topol there 's a mention new maps of craters and Waikato River trials we 've got a new website a couple of months ago we had a visit from Anne Tolley and MP Minister Anne Tolley and her entourage getting your feet quite dirty seeing all the PD work seeing the tracks that we 've rebuilt with Ed we generally had a commitment dear that she 's happy to turn on the tap for more PD workers as long as we can now fund the supervisors just great because we just cannot understand understate the difference that it makes having network Falls there the but the bike copal partners program has been launched it 's like taupe or initiative has been launched with 19,000 1968 kids on bikes the rural road safety initiative a Mason and paper the rural road users group or rug which has been established by bike topol and trans power working with TDC other right heavy transport road users etc to try and get total to be a safer place driver to drive the pipe obey poisoning project we 've also recently commissioned an economic impact assessment on cycling so we can actually quantify what are the actual financial benefits for cycling to the district so we can actually measure what some of our initiatives and events occur what difference it makes to the local we write submissions and complain about things and also tries to dish things and so from getting in front of and all such as yourself and introduced different ways to facilitate increase and prototype was a cycling destination and last but not least we put a toilet and craters and which is solve the whole bunch of issues very likely local to that area and also just made again improving the facilities that we can put place for locals and visitors that right alike so that 's totality of my our presentation today so that 's what we 've been up to now we 've got more plans to keep on doing the same over the next 12 months are happy to take any questions Delta Williams thinks fix rod I 'm how are their negotiations and proceeding with regards to the land from my horo the trail for my around to kava kava Bay we as we will the trick go via national subway at this stage we 're not planning to connect to college ave we do have plans to extend self from whitewater but as i said discussions with landowners and Marty landowners there the vast majority track is currently built on public land but there are different options of expansion self and also over the hill to connect up to the timber tract as well one of the reasons why we don 't want to we 're not anticipating in the short term commuting up the cargo bay as we think the idea of writing from state highway and then getting a boat shuttle from like horror or wherever back to can lock is got a lot of winds associated at especially respect to creation of business and creation of a potential am a regular water taxi service on the lake that 's one of the outcomes that we want to we want the trail to have and what we 're building up wife hora also lends itself to some particularly good day walks so it could be families that go over to work war ever walk in a picnic in future camp and in come back later on the day on the next time shuttle so it 's quite we see some positive at the but we 're always thinking about ways to extend and even ideas of coming back to total from highway and things that were thinking about long term but all of those involved from going up a private men and we need to face discussion Phillip and yeah with your kids bike type or program and do you go out to my channel I 'm haven 't_''_1165.71 at the moment it 's normally done on Invitational basis we do get out to Tommy did I school and katani and white I her newly so we 're not total focus so yeah more than happy to do then suppose I 'll say on behalf of counselors row and thanks very much and for you and your team

    "text": "welcome to our Ram monthly full council meeting the last tuesday of every month so firstly welcome to everybody well it 's got an interest and issues pertaining to today 's agenda I 'll be calling for apologies but I won 't because yeah none we have a full house here today so please remember a team that the meeting is being recorded we do get often complaints that our systems not right up to speed and sometimes very difficult to hear what you as counselors have to say on the webcam so please make sure your mics are on and speak into your and your mouthpiece some when you are speaking so being no apologies which is my right to do is to edge here is to move the agenda around now I notice there 's a lot of hard-working people here from the top o hospice trust here today so without any further ado I 'm going to move the agenda straightaway to agenda item number 8 which is leasing land for the tap a hospice to build new premises on so we 'll move straight away to eight so I see we 've got miss Rowley here welcome miss Rowley and your um I 'm sorry to spring it on yet we 're going straight to achieve item number eight I didn 't really think that those good people down the back they 've got a lot of work to do one of the city of a half an hour let me to drag at you with you is there any questions here we have mr. Giamatti who 's reading involved in most things good in the community so welcome to you mr. Giamatti is that microphone on Daniel so no one works and one doesn 't nice blow all the candles are out I 'm will just hand over to you thank you thank you mr. mayor and councillors so we 're really pleased to have the opportunity to come and talk to you about what we 're on about here and but just first a little bit of background about the lake taupo hospice trust and its activities there because there are some misunderstandings about what hospice does and I just like to make clear come to hospice who are dying but they come to live to live as fuller lives as they can at what time they 've got left they come to hospice when medical intervention is pretty well run its course and they know that there is an inevitable outcome but it could be some time away the other misunderstanding is that it 's not just cancer people people with cancer come to hospice its people with a terminal condition a life-threatening condition we have about 60 to 70 patients on average naturally there 's quite a few quite a high turnover and quite a few deaths each year the present hospice is located in a building freehold building that we own mortgage free in sunset Street and the difficulty is that the need for our services is growing rapidly as we 're all aging and we 've really outgrown sunset street and a symptom of that is some of the complaints we know that you have received was we 've received them as well about parking mostly on a Tuesday I 'm going to come back to that in a moment people need to live a full life in their own home amongst their family without having to go and live in a hospital and a die in a hospital the objective is for people to live and then eventually to die surrounded by their family and that takes a lot of equipment and a lot of medical support pain relief mostly in medical support but equipment is a big part of the services that Hospice provides we particularly provide electric lazy boys for instance I 've stopped calling him electric chairs and cases any misunderstanding electric beds because people it gives people as that little measure of independence that with an electric beard and a remote control they can sit themselves up when they need to and turn themselves over and so on and often the people who are caring for people who are dying are old themselves and are not physically able to lift and move people so we provide all of that kind of equipment we have closed we have full-time nurses three and a half full time people equivalent although there 's more actual people than that services that the nurses provide now those volunteers they are the active volunteers who do something for hospice or for patients at least once a week so they 're pretty active people and it 's quite a large number taupo lake to have a hospice gets a lot of support from its community they provide things like that just to smooth people 's way and they provide meals there 's a whole host of volunteers who cooked meals and freeze them and they are delivered and families need them they chop firewood we have lawyers who will do enduring powers of attorney and Will 's job for necessary at that time we have trained biographers who will write people 's life stories and that 's often important to Family Center and it 's something positive that a dying person can do it 's something that often gets overlooked but it 's something that the person who eventually dies leaves behind for the family the most popular service I think we have art from massage and those kind of therapies is what we call our Tuesday club on Tuesdays patients and some kind of activity sometime art and craft sometimes as listen to your speaker occasionally it 's a visit and it 's so popular that we find that people get off their sick beard and even in this bed to come because they 're in a supporting environment and their with other people in a similar circumstance so it 's empowering and it 's non-threatening but that 's when we have our parking problems a lot of people come to that Tuesday club now the other possible misunderstanding we want to correct is that a lot of people think that hospice is associated with ambulances and helicopters and late nights our rooms and things like that we found that that was a common misconception when we looked at some other sites like tangy martensite and the rainbow point site we don 't have any of that we don 't have any impatient beads and people come for things like our Tuesday Club survivors come for some of our looking to the future our clubs on a Thursday run by our social worker and but we don 't have anything we don 't have ambulances and we don 't have sirens or helicopters so it 's the kind of activity that you 'd expect around a suburban street anyway it 's not what you 'd expect to see around a hospital we intend to put into our planning the provision for inpatient beds at some time in the future we don 't expect that it 'll be very soon our intention as if if we get to the point where we do need some inpatient beds we intend to it and we are in the middle of exploring with some of the rest homes who have hospital beds paying for patients to spend a week or two in those beads rather than providing inpatient beds ourselves running a hospital with impatient beds and all that goes with it is extraordinarily expensive and we 're really trying to avoid doing that it costs about five hundred thousand a year to run the lake taupo hospice we get about three hundred thousand of that from through contracts from the local dhb for the services we provide and we save of course the hospital dollars a day for a hospital bed every day that through our services people stay in their own homes it 's not only better for them it saves the DHB an enormous amount of money but between 300 and 500 thousand there 's 200,000 which we raise ourselves and we have volunteers who do that the only other thing I wanted to mention is part of our fundraising which has been extraordinarily successful because people of support us so well is our hospice shop up at the totra Park Shopping Center and there we have about another 40 to 50 volunteers who work there at least once a week and so the point I would like to just emphasize as I conclude is that we we are a community facility we think we 're an important part of the community and we believe that the community recognizes that and supports us but we can 't continue to live where we are we have to find ourselves a new site mr. Muir would it be helpful for me to introduce my colleagues on the trust so that counselors that who asked Phil Clark a trustee susie cooper who 's our nurse team leader clinical nurse leader vanilla hodgkinson who represents the locally we health groups Jeremy Owen who 's chairman of our development subcommittee who 's been running the whole investigation into where we might move Peter baddesley is on our treasurer and kevin robbins who 's our project manager architect who 's been doing the more technical side so apart from in addition to the papers that you 've got there mr. Muir our letter and Allison rule is very helpful paper I thought I 'd just make those background remarks so that we 're all talking about the same thing and of course we 're happy to answer any questions I up to my fellow counsel to see what sort of questions of clarity or anything they might like to know just keep that complicate just well done moist wonderful work fantastic nyjah 's house is this in competition with the bright park piece of land Alison or is it two separate title it 's an entirely separate piece of land on us different okay they will be immediately there there may be some considerations around that but both parties are aware of each other 's assistants if I might as drop down a little bit in there too with those yes if I might add Keith to your helpful question the hospice motto is living every moment in other words we 're about getting the most out of life while your lifespan is now predetermined and shorten and Susie who of course we rely on for advice on this aspect gave a lot of thought to that and in the end with their nurses came to the conclusion that the bike typo activities are a feature of life they 're not about you know it 's it 's something of interest and shows that life does go on the yeah I 'm not a lot more to say than that but it has been thought about but it 's not a lot of serious problem society yes it is I it 's not a boy cycle yeah that was an unintended pun woman I ever got to I can 't help noticing when I go to funerals what always a babe in arms at a funeral life does go on and thank you Morris for your presentation I see here that the new purpose-built facility would be the vicinity of about 2 million dollars two and a half maybe wait you know it 's a little ballpark at the moment but it 's round about there that sunset straight is currently we hold would you be looking to sell that facility yes what sort of value is there on sensitive moment how long before maybe ha I 'm just trying to think this is quite a huge commitment mr. Muir yes the moment is their commitment to make yes and we we have an integral part of this decision aids on I think on the lads are twisting the best thing you can do for our scam so if I might say so is keep any costs from your side down that 's right what we know that the mirror is quite correct it is a big commitment and you are correct as well and we 're going into this with our eyes open we know that we here for the long haul we 've been here for many years and we 're not going away and the need is not going away and so it 's a task that we just have to take on and we 're confident we think we can do it 30 there is tremendous support for the hospice in the community that when you anywhere around town you go to buy theater and and they know it 's for the hospice you don 't have to ask for a discount it 's often thank you worship just before i move the suggested resolution Morris are you I assume you 've seen the resolution yes I don 't we have one question to ask and one sort of a comment to make counsel the comment I 'd just like my is because I know you 've done the investigation of the geothermal restraints on that particular land you 're happy with your investigations that 's been taking boats yes we as the mayor will remember we looked at County Avenue in the mere was a great supporter for us going there and was that 's no surprise but there were question marks about the suitability of the land and so we decided that we looked at some possibilities as well to see if there was an alternative and really there wasn 't and so we decided to spend the seven thousand dollars that was necessary to get geotechnical engineers to draw and establish that you can have a building there because if there was no point not spending any other money and then finding we couldn 't proceed but all have been just wasted so we spent our seven thousand dollars and we 've got a quite clear geotechnical report that there are no insurance or subsidence or other issues involved with what we are proposing to do on that site Pospisil yes now just before you move out about the resolution yes if I might we we just want to put on the record the high level of help that we 've had from council officers particularly Alison the we can 't speak too highly of the quality of the work that she and the other officers have done but there is to comment on the the point has been made in that paper that the lease could be 33 years plus 33 which would be most suitable to us bearing in mind the level expenditure that 's going to be involved for us and we don 't want to move anyway away from there but it does suggest that we bear the costs of the subdivision now we would like to ask you to consider that and with respect our our view is that the the land is owned by the council it 's waste land at the moment it 's if it is subdivided there will be more land available for other community activities and we 're we 're wondering if the council would consider paying for the subdivision since you 're going to continue to own the land and we 're only going to do this easy anyway it 's how to try to leave our side of the cost down below that two and a half million so question allison is the subdivision to separate that particular lot from the County Avenue big site and do we know processing costs for council would be in the vicinity of probably fifteen hundred dollars and then there would be the preparation of the consent which I 'm told could be around that seventeen thousand dollar map I think to address that part of that you 've raised in mr. Chia Nadia this is probably not for met to do it I think you 'll probably fine going into the future the fish was a good rigid hospice do that you would always be met with favor rather than the other but I think where do we get this deal done here today that would be something you would need to prep come to the annual plan next year or the long term plan I let 's get this underway you got 33 years to worry about that the intentions are all written there and they would be you know they 'll be binding on all parties and so I think that would be the place to look at some sort of grant or when the annual plan process or something like that so I don 't think we can address have it minuted it 's about fun often going there counselor Henderson thanks the presentation and for the obvious support you 've got here today to it 's great to see from the community just one question and the officers report here there 's a statement may prefer the option to charge a community rental or even a market rental at some date in the future and obviously you know you want to keep the cost down and counselor quite committed to that the only reason I raised the question asked how you feel about that is because obviously it 'll be councils in the future who may sees things differently or may not but um just that obviously doesn 't lock them and quite as far as what you 're I can accept the fact you 're pointing the long term lease and understand the reasoning behind that so it 's just curious how you feel about that that option they come in we 're a client here we don 't make the rules and we accept that and we are beholden to the council and we 're grateful the we have a 33 + 33 at a pivotal and rental but we do accept there are some realities here and a future council might be more cash-strapped than this one where will I have no comment to make I couldn 't possibly comment on there the well that is our preference but really in the end it 's up to what the council decides if you can see you a clear to to put into the original lease and I imagine the me is right those kind of discussions will take place when we 're discussing the lease itself what I see happening today is an agreement or an offer in principle to have the hospice there 's the community hospice and the details like that will be negotiated data and at that point we would certainly be trying to persuade the council to agree that the the total lease the at a peppercorn rental but we do accept that that amount of time is a long way in the future and I find it difficult to envisage what it might be like next year let alone in was to hear if it affected your bigger picture play in the operation it doesn 't sound like it does in the bigger scheme of things it wouldn 't stymie it yes just before I get councillor heckling I just want to say that again yet thank you very much the presentation I think you know as well as I do counseling and I were a sort of a little bit of a ad hoc committee put together to work with this I guess it 's been three years I know in the very early stages i was adamant we 've got to get down here faces loss it 's a beautiful place to river and all the biking in those young de noises from young people they 're not all that bad when you get old you know um particularly don 't have beards and people here but also a very great place having been involved in hospice when I lost but they have to go for a walk somewhere with family natori I think this is an entry brilliant place and I know council heckling work we work 're really supportive of this and I 'm really pleased to see this come to fruition before the end of this train IAM council heckling wanted to be the move run it he asked me before and i 'm going to allow that i 'm also going to ask that i could second it I don 't normally second things but I 'm going to ask that I can but I know that counselor heckling I would like to make a small alteration to the resolution which is on page eight bar 3 sword hand back to you can select Lee yes thank you you wish it I 'd like other counselors to consider under the lease rental not being five years but ten years as a practical and rental which I 'll give auspice some leeway into the into this week 's so with that amendment your worship if other counselors agree to that I would like to move the suggested resolution and i would like to secret do we have any support from their fellow councillors to the amendment and to the resolutions all those in favor i it Thank You mr. mayor we 'll do our best and will help as much as we can _"

Gilbert there but me personally I think it 's high time that we did do what the suggested reservation seized from my point of view three it 's doing a great job it just seems to be the kid with my weight I think future planning we 're too how to why etc cancel my only comment on this is that um I think whatever the outcome people may disagree with me I think this will require money to be put into it in the future obviously some of that will come from ratepayers I just hate to see the council spend a lot of time and money going down a path of discussions of the various parties in particularly to fatty tire without actually discussing the money issue until very late in the piece we could waste a lot of time and go nowhere at the end of the day from reading this I would think whatever comes out of it 's going to cost money whether that should fall solely on the right pale or other parties as well I think needs to be addressed reasonably early in the process rather than kind of ignored to a later issue and if significant work done and then address that issue and have parties not being prepared to even enter into that process of fronting up possibly with money to paper so just suggest done at some earlier stage in crisis secretion from school we don 't think very much some pretty comprehensive them I 'm aghast at all the parties you 've managed to contact on process you 've simply got a really good overview of the national government gallery and museum governance I 'm just dis accretion with regards to that I would have thought that your what your work would be to hand over to her you see I 'm working with earlier than the suggested resolution I would have thought solitary well certainly the costs don 't lie in any work that I would be doing my work is almost completed once we 've got the terms of reference sorted and you know just get all those on a mechanical administrative that 's done so so that 's not going to be a cost to this work I think that it 's very difficult to talk about costs in any useful way for a working party until you know what the costs of what I think I think you have to start out working out well what kind of a go back to the leader from the two farrotto transport on this which says we 'd like a working party just to kind of understand things better it 's not even a working party to propose a new museum it 's a working party to look at what some possible ways forward with us what are our common interests so I don 't see that that will have any costs beyond you know turn up to meetings I fear here must go but there 's that 's actually take us exactly back where we were eight years ago when we had friends of cortical defendants in which gym amends the museum they ran the museum they were supposed to look for do everything and they meet all the time and outdoor thing and it got to a stage where they couldn 't actually they found they couldn 't do anything because they didn 't have any funding and they were losing quite a considerable amount of year that they couldn 't keep filling that void so they got handed back to Council and it became rate payer funded I just again yeah I can don 't confuse this place with them with the outcome so this is all this is about as saying let 's get away from group to wear my tour I thought and I agree with that because it has to be a way forward you 've got a old wooden building that could burn down at any minute it hasn 't got all our wrath after accident that we would like in it so yeah I agree because it even then it 's gone only do with the building of the stages just about that the governance structure so at the moment the museum corner should have some dudes a building because mr. green with the greatest respect in the last triennium we put a sum around about fifty thousand dollars into from our annual pre approaches to the bowling club we 've got one of the bowling greens back as part of that because I had three and they astra to have all we 've got one back for our future expansion for the museum and everything I will throw you one of your own even elephant one bite at a time the first prize has it up your governance committee the second bite us to the inverse of mana first body should hang on can probably I can 't believe I 'm just to clarify I hear what must go what say and what mr. green saying about it and there 's a process to be going through and all I 'm saying is that at an appropriate time in that process I would suggest that it 's worth talking about in principle are we going to be the parties involved funding partners what not because so often these partnerships are here talked about I mean the right buyer pays and others just get to participate in the decision now if we 're particularly in this case looking to hold cultural artifacts so subject to two fatty tire you can spend a lot of time and money writing documents and going down a path for a couple of years and then we 'll be like okay who 's going to pay or not us we thought you obtain but we thought you were paying table an appropriate time early in the process or else you 'll get to the 11th hour and we 'll come back on the right pose most likely to pay from work the way food from here too we want to have a working group I get this up I feel it want to delve a bit deeper so you need a working group to do that how many people do you need off the council or would it be ideal or what um to be honest I 'm not completely sure yet because what we basically you need equals numbers from both teams is what works best to have that kind of working around the table and for a bunch of kind of administrative reasons um it 's not clear how many people they would be planning to put forward I would say no more than four from this council and no less than to the suggested resolution here is that you drafted terms of reference tip to tip you that 's not going to cost us any money per se add a little bit of staff time and fertile again okay got a mover for that lube comes Williams ticketed come to Johnson all in favor I you know item number 21 triennial election 2013 I think this is fairly mechanical every year for every three years or whatever it is you have election we 've used this system here on the last page where the names are drawn out of a hat as to where they go on the voting paper ticket so see for Cooper 's not necessarily at the top w for Williams is not necessarily at the bottom that photo the head that could be at the top my name could be at the bottom that 's the way it 's been done it every other election if you guys are happy that I suggest you stick to that Justin here is actually something a little bit different why not why are we changing and there 's three ways so there 's the alphabetical way which why we all I 'm asking and why are we changing from our then you got the pseudo naman and then you 've got the truly random so there 's each voting paper as random so for each household the names will be random on each on each paper different a different paper comes with my mailbox to yours it cost us much more and now with the new system the cost of there is actually no different to those pseudo-random so that 's why I 've offered that up as a as a suggestion because it does allow for that well that 's the only thing we really need to debate it today Tim in the past for users of wind here was pulled out of a hat in the room here and every form just got printed that way now you 're saying that forms just get just get printed and all sorts of shapes and sizes I don 't mean shadows like that I mean your names and all sorts of different places so my for might be doesn 't your form to your film pupil that comes in your mailbox so which way do you want it cancel it just to clarify that spirit random water we 're talking about which is okay and exact you take like it we used to use pseudo-random now you 're suggesting random which means that the voting papers can all be different so now your name might be as a top on one paper and on the bottom on the next 12 pins details together also a lot of all the time alphabetical we can use alphabetical we also used to use are used to year yeah but it tended to be the people try to take away in me like alpha do well with d Ford a man would come major Henderson having a CD or no i don 't_''_629.949 so those to me so that the random order one seems the ferris yes so you know there 's no extra cost I don 't think it was available to us last time I don 't remember to fiend discuss it wasn 't available a pseudo-random or alphabetical yes I night so you guys will help you that is just in 2 i 'll move their for Cooper I mean we have my name in bold letters hahaha I tell it okay move move move move character Henderson oils a favor hi thank you agenda item number 22 council engagement the one that 's missing off here and with your blessing I cost me ten dollars to get proved wrong haha and you laugh um mr. Buckley and mr. Lang and mrs. depth and a couple of others are coming to counsel to have a talk to you as requested by you on what date before 24 now just an interesting situations arise here so they 're going to come down to talk about their future views on governance here on couch government etc now they 've refused to meet with the Academy 's now I 'm in a mirror forum on monday would anybody have any objection to me inviting the fellow mayors of the PM for this presentation going to have it all as a public meeting it 's not a closed meeting anyway so but I 'm not going to tell me that you don 't want me to do I 'm just going to mention if I wrote to them on your behalf they have accepted they 're coming at whatever time my fellow me as if they would like to come down I would like how you work with all due respect to worship to make a genuine I genuinely a genuine invitation that we want to hear their views I don 't think we should be tuning into a circus I think this I don 't think that would be constructed after me up to be honest I don 't the other means would turn into a circus but however it 's up to you wouldn 't you also might if you were to do that you 'd need to delete them know that you 're going to do that and it 's highly likely did it won 't happen and become a faster others others agree with the counselors yeah I mean chairman Peter Buckley 's reply was that he didn 't see a need for that meeting because there was a regular scheduled one coming up from your forum so well though he declined the meeting it wasn 't like he 's saying go why won 't talk to you so no doubt will be discussed at the I don 't see a need to but anything I know what happens looks one more time ok and these capital engagements terrain tongue Area Community Board Tuesday 42 has been cancelled som this apparent care come together now agenda items help is that chemical to go still going to happen they want to i say biked up i want to present that 's our next council meeting you

length of the agenda and decided that not to but we could hear three and limit to 15 minutes of you wanted will see here on is that fear and then mo because they can go to the next run do we have a mess out here the next month oh my god I 'm easy look would you like to necklace just come to dinosaur I cannot put my apologies in for the deliberations for the Monday the 13th I 've got a meeting of

    "text": "as the April meeting and moving on now to agenda item number 10 listen Tim quite a few of these items here you would have rid them they 're very very mechanical we need three people for an ad hoc committee here to do some work on whether trees right to be topped or not to the top I and of course that falls under a vegetation policy so could we have three volunteers or nominations please for this ad hoc committee now that we did do another ad hoc committee at the last meeting tues Rena yeah guess I 'm just thinking about these ad hoc committees what 's one we formed up the last council meeting a co work to do are those our concept any difference this hemlock structure I tell Pope shape shelter as any other said what committees want to take on the steep Tito ki gali trees issue or do I knew I on total two or three will we did a new one right out so I need three names please come to the coop council heckling does it live in the Talpiot your past you are a tree expert but I please have your volunteering yes you can online Kate cancel the hexagon one more place there was it canceled the Johnson could somebody please move that we 've come to the crate second Counsell Williams rise in favor I was on to a pub right now I 'm sorry I just I 'm I 'm sorry I 've just got a member Julia the back has been waiting for a while in this just this is another one I 've got which is item item 12 is it would you mind that 's what I live a gender item number 11 is going to take shorter than what you disaffected because this was gone this is going out to pop public consultation the public have decided that they want the ball out of all of out of all the out of all the ways of getting water to them so the suggested we just a new board be drilled and connected the bunch of our water supplies to ensure to creative water supply move a piss move come to the Henderson You mr. Lewis thank you mrs. you know item number 12 now mr. it the air conditioning it doesn 't work and has them for as long as I 've been here and what exit just introduced you to white I who 's going to present this item why date Julie ok so we ship counselors and I 'm sure you 've read the item sorry I 'm a little bit nervous this whistle been here you guys look scary before so the air conditioning is past this viable life it 's over 40 years old and it 's causing us a lot of problems and maintenance and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn 't and it 's really had to get parts for it because the system is so old so what we 're asking for is some budgeted capex to upgrade the system and get it working so we have really good working conditions for our staff as well as you guys will be fair to say that we 've actually got a responsibility about air quality in the building where we 've got started and then thermal comfort and it needs to sit in between 18 and 21 degrees and at the moment we have one person on our staff that has a thermometer in a room and every time it goes over 25 degrees she rings me that mine all the time and I 've never run you better yeah I got em questions please it 's pretty it 's pretty straightforward you either fix it or you don 't and it needs a new one we 're sorry yeah if we 're I mean under legislation that we have to we have to but if you want to treat your staff the way they 're supposed to be treated under OSHA regulations amongst other thing unless somebody can tell me how you can fix the air conditioning unit for less generally good I just wondered like I totally appreciate the budget but has that gone out but will it go out 14 days oh gosh could you please ensure that a company called Excel are used now nodes are out of town but we 've done them in three cases recently that I know 15 different users yes antennas of you screwed I 'm yeah I support doing it there 's also the protection of the asset which is the building ASU the right post that 's the other issue that 's worth considering an awesome i think it can ask how much window lectures cost would win 50,000 always say five years now five thousand to those done well I Rica where you know basically tame a year between a rock and a hard place it is worn out its lifespan is gone it needs a new one or just keep chasing your proverbial and we 've done that for as long as I 've been in here my can bury this air conditioner has been a nightmare either fix it or you don 't so is the remover dr. Johnson seeking to counsel Henderson all those in favor I think it changes a perfectly what 's it up here it 's been like to the last you know they did I was going to say the arm this makes agenda item here lease in this land we spoke about on the bus that I felt what we retain and that we 've got some something something great and big should go there the rest that 's the flight plan that comes in i told you helicopter in phoenix at lane so anything that was to go on there has to go through the safety committee at the airport before it even comes to taa so there is a suggested resolution here as an appendix and I 've you 've got it not allowed to lease land under local government act longer than 35 years so i would i would promote the idea that in the suggested resolution that was handed out to you as an appendix is that we put the letters 35 in there because of someone 's going to build hangar of any substance and put a big building on it they certainly need length of tenure going forward if you also read the article i think i explained that in the in the bus anything that the airport committee that they lease out there any income they get off that they get off that land ninety percent must be they get 50 50 of the ten percent that 's left if there 's a profit made by the airport so I don 't know Ellen do you want to talk any more about this year on April committee with Chris annoy I just suggest me a wreck that we add the words for a period of 35 years with right of renewal in it now you can t have any hot only 35 years so you have to cross out actually you have to cross it with rights of renewal out that 's as long as you can lease a piece of land without doing a subdivision move and see you can move comes now seeking can take it all as a favor I chief executive officers reporting who 's that today you must have a him yes you were yesterday a I 'll take it as read it 's just one comment I 'd like to make and it 's hardly as a result of an issue raised at the last council meeting in the financials and also subsequent letter to the editor and it talks we talked cost of borrowing and a very simple equation was used that if the cost of borrowing is greater than the investment return that we should concern using those investment funds to reduce debt life 's not quite that simple the te l fund we use for example is our catastrophe fund so as a result of that we do not have to take out catastrophe insurance and respect of all the district assets there is a substantial cost in catastrophe insurance and and where the insurance market is it 's an increasing costs so that is another element that needs to be taken into account in conjunction with the investment return the second point is that the level of standard poor 's rating that we have is supported by the fact that we have such a large investment book should we use that investment book to reduce the debt then our credit rating with Standard Poor 's would reduce and our cost of borrowing would increase I 'm just flagging those as just two examples of how life 's not just quite so simple as far as comparing an investment of other reasons why you manage your treasury books in the way we 're doing that 's independent of any direction as far as a teal funders concerned as a separate fund but I just thought I just raised at particular points because they were mentioned at the last council meeting and respectively investment return now leveling out as it has historically it 's been less than the cost of borrowing but apart from that happy to answer any questions innocent yeah my question is around the first issue you address their of the disaster recovery insurance if we didn 't have the TL fun and we 're using it for those purposes could you give us some estimate of what that might be costing us annually and we are looking at it Brian do you have don 't have an exact figure mr. chair and we don 't belong to the local authority protection program to your council do belong to because we have and as it because I presume there 's been counseled position cool the event a catastrophe the treasury management policy is listed as being about as you are aware now looking to develop one and see the members of the amenity measurement committee will be aware of it and it 's part of the consideration I can 't give you an exact figure out what the premium costs would be belong to a lab program because the questio tuition has changed at ball practice what if you fear their to say that and love not knowing that we would be up for possibly hundreds of thousands or tenth year ok hundreds thanks Lee well movement in the hundreds of thousands n ET la familia it would be significant I 'm sorry our story comes Williams he comes down to the fifth paragraph the in your annual playing confrontation with repairs could you give could you give me some feedback about how many people have showed up in those very expensive consultations around the region that we send our council staff and counselors out well I 've attended two or three myself at the Riverside Park one there were three maybe four members of the public that stopped to ask questions and that was on a similar sorts of numbers another events i think we had only a handful at manga keno wasn 't there councillor tremor it 's interesting and they on the net today i read that a number of councils have had very low turnouts this year as far as here public consultation meetings so what we 're experiencing in Taupo is not too similar to most the rest of the country because everybody has tried to pull back on the right increases sperm here she sees that they 've been very effective and raising the profile of the draft class sentence um which I guess is a little bit Christian will after what you 've just conveyed that um but also just I know where to do it by law but I 'd also just like trap question effect that are we doing at the right way because for the amount of effort and investment we 're getting such such a poor response from the public um well perhaps perhaps one way of looking at it is that we 've been so effective with our communication that we haven 't been required over a 100 submissions so I 100 you 1517 submissions which is a higher number than I think most people expected and differently what the sweepstake around the office here was and I think it 's probably reflection that that the word was spread as just again and I agree with you it 's about how we spread their word what we generally do after each of these things as debrief staff in terms of what the most effective way is and then have a discussion with you leading into the next major consultation about how we do that I mean it may be that we need to freshen up the ways that we do it for next time and we 'll ever think about there and bring that back to lead not for the next end of that Mike event of joy comforter down and income teams y 'all_''_849.81 I 've been involved we we 've had big ones in the Great Lakes Center and you know coincide with civil defense and all led in there but simple factors as long as we do under legislation have to consult like the business after five the chambers of commerce we 've talked about the annual plan where there 's been a good up taken a net but there 's always traditionally when you go away to like what calls or riverside park or the new wheel down turing it is only ever three or four people that normally come tune-up every year they come to it but it 's part of our process that we have to do we have to be out there open and transparent innocent hmm yes we do have to consult how we choose to consult is completely up to us within reason how we 're consulting in this regard so far as an abject failure and has been tired time I 've been elected every time we bring this issue up I say the same thing which is essentially that if you keep doing the same thing and expect a different outcome as a definition for that okay if two or three people turn up it is not successful if we 're doing this as a box-ticking exercise as required under the Act that we how we market these things we actually look at how we do consultation completely and yes we should do these public things but we should do less of them and we should look at some other means because at the end of the day if people are engaging with us on this limited basis are we in turn four maybe five of this and the average number of people that would have sought out information to me or others present is about three okay so it 's not working you can mark it as much as you like you can keep doing the same thing you 'll come up with the same answer so here next year have the same discussion it 's just to review the whole thing get serious about how you doing community consultation and engaging with people and stop treating it like a box checking exercise which it sometimes is to be honest OGB doodles report don 't look good I just I agree with cancel Henderson but i also think then it is really smart to tap into those chamber of commerce event from business getting through to people that are business owners and people then have a vested interest in the community that i 'm on the whole I definitely agree with counsel he 's nothing that needs to be looked at more typically officers report being numb to a mover in a second receiving at least we 've come for Kirk second the comfort women all those in favor all right thank you pratik manager that will probably you mr. mean Hannah now you 're the CEO today so who does this job think you multitask I will I think Willis play for mr. Ward with water it 's really a mechanical item at some counter controlled organization drafts as the end of statements we 're comfortable with them that 's where we want them to hear that 's what we want them to do is there any comment on them does anybody it 's a legal performant that we have to purple I 'm sorry is this all of the ones we were receiving it I 've been do them all yet we got five um yo just call me a lot late to help i won I see a new statement of intent but I don 't see a lot of detail about what they 're actually going to do in terms of how it will be delivered and I 'd like to see more detail on that I think particularly given that some of the expenditure related to what they 're doing is significant particularly around the web site which I 've drawn attention to before I was down there so I didn 't see the retro ok so I 'm a mule sorry yep so you throw the chair this is this is the opportunity for council to comment on um I 'm here so I so um can we describe a bit of a summary for what we 'd like to do for that part of the GLT then I can reflect it back to them when you need that boy and that the statement of Mt our response to the statement of intenders drew by the first of may so and third yep yeah so we 're gonna get back to you tonight so when when we 've looked at and the statement of intent last year and now our printers that it 's a different improvement and they 've actually gone on to a lot of detail looking at both and the performance objectives and they 've also done the nature and scope of activities looking at what they do and what they don 't do they 've also talked about them how they 're going to get there so they 've broken it down to three pillars so this page 15 bar 14 I 've talked about people collaboration and joint venture and special interest marketing and programs if you go back to the presentation that miss Freeman and miss guy gave at the last council meeting and to dougie and they talked a lot about and need to be agile and so and the budget that that 's it out there is obviously bucket so they 're looking at using and how that proposing to get those performance objectives and that 's saying it need to be flexible so if we 're not happy with it and we should be signaling it would be some in this projection for the revenuers is 120 thousand dollar drop in the revenue off about I think I 've ever use it it 's total revenue DG LT why is that because of what I 'm thinking three years hundred i think it was incorrectly reported masculine over the chair page FFM basov until i assume is what we 're referring to the budget if i referred back to again the presentation at miss Freeman mask i gave regarding a budget they spoke about and the difficult nature of the tourism ensure at the moment and they spoke about the two invention marketing and how they won 't give you the money in that required so I 'm without speaking on their behalf I would assume that that drop every new would be part of that basis the drop in revenue i refer to relates to the figures we were provided for in the 2012-13 statement of until budget for 14 full year 14 2014 was revenue 857 thousand and now we have total income given of 734 thousand so I just point that out because I think excellent kaltaka and does this does the income take into account and about with eyesight the possible and cam generated of the bus stop being located at that 's a nice up being like attending office would have fought all up here um again through the chi odd I can 't give you the exact answer as to how much of its included I know that they are we playing meeting they are meeting weekly words both in the city and our staff and regards to that change over and with regards to the full dollar booking fee and I that there to be another minute without any problems in terms of what they 've put an ear for your budget for next year I know that they have not cost that all out because I just simply do not know if they 're going to be getting team percy know the travel seem driven you one hundred percent and if i could also just respond to the cushion raised before regarding their drop an income and yes sir n comes dropped from my rate about their required requirement for it while they have dropped some income they 've also cut your expenditure you anybody want anything further okay being month they 1 2 3 4 5 si coz the suggested resolution of that we make the following comments on its council controlled orginated draft 13 putting statements of intent as they remover I 'll move think of that come sit down at all in favor all right carried do you know item number 16 as purely mechanical I believe it is our submission to the source Management Act reform that 's taking place at the moment I think those bullet points there 126 really encapsulate like our position on what we want he 'll this going for does anybody have any questions for mr. green has been involved in this quite heavily um actually I wouldn 't want a senator Hillary to see if I 'm sure I hurry I don 't cease together I 'm a Semel tell you I 'm thank you would you like to I don 't have fun anything to add really and it 's all the in front of you and I 'll dammit i went to the workshop with the minister and and one of the things that kind of stuck in my head is not make it at military monetary but obviously there 's going to be a huge cost to you know to coincide with regional plans is there any further like with the mural like they 're looking at plans can we set one avenue that we can go down to try and get a lot of that work done through the mayoral forum because that was one of the things they were looking at was all the plans both and all the districts and obviously Waikato regional borders like many regional councils on a lot of different districts set one way we can leverage a little bit of way yeah well I guess and one of the issues that we had with the discussion document was it still quite high level we 're still actually trying to figure out and what they actually mean with some of the proposals that they 've got an ear and for example these some talking about combining the plans we 're still the inner district which is have applied for regions whether that means we end up with full regional pains attached two hours plus all the district plans that are also in those regions we just we can actually figure out how that is going to work and so I guess it 's probably going to be a process of merely information would not be as obviously it incorporates all the districts so you know there could be a lot of discussion on there to see whether as you say I 'm in the dynamics that I mean most districts have got lots of regionals bordering on the memo we 've probably got Falls probably the last year yeah yeah a traitor is having to that they 're pretty small areas of that we are we are part of the Waikato so we have a couple of water to layton but yes come to the imbecile just some apply to council Donald 's question i believe the mayoral forum one of the work streams is looking at governance and one 's looking planning and I think yeah but the rationalization and they 're looking at and I believe that it 's identified that there can be some money saved and some things done better there when I spoke about or heard it spoken about and been involved in conversation with the other mirrors they just don 't want to do it you know it 's even like it 's even issues like signage in Taupo we have just signage rules whatever they are you know in another town they have their loud this size and they love this size they do it for reason queenstown only allow you to have a slime think it 's 400 but one because of the natural escape they have their reasons for it but i 'm all for one and one for all have one plan for the whole country as far as I 'm concerned but on to the elastic and simplistic like this but everybody saying that tum the rules that we we wouldn 't necessarily apply to the likes of Tokyo or Hamilton time right because somebody because of our soil types greatly different type of country to everybody else but however another mirror forum on monday and i will show them is that there is our submission to the resource management egg submissions and see what they think of it whether they 're and support or not i 'm sure they will be because they 're making their own submissions on it I can n can I just clarify one point at the moment the proposal is actually just to combine the documents physically so take the Waikato regional plan in hole punch it and add it into the topol district plan yes they 're not talking about ass writing and a whole new plan with the Waikato region on a bigger basis they are talking about a template and national team plate of standardized terms and definitions that we will have two may have Tove it goes through and look at the fair to say that if somebody comes in here to apply for a permit to do something that if this happens there 's more hurdles for the developer to jump because he has this other plan overlaid on top of the district then rolls the actual rules wouldn be to give that a more cost of the developer but it 'd be a cost to you and the ratepayer in terms of putting these plans together in the first place so the question is is that our value and I guess we are looking at say in an Auckland situation where you 've got a unitary council and you 've got one rule book so people a ninja block wine place and for developments when you of them to apply for two or three different consenting from the regional council in US District Council probably does make sense what we 're saying is worth having the four regions and all those things it just makes it complicated because are we going to end up with a robot which it infects us but contains the process and cost us all a lot of money to get rather than the current status quo gently we 've got one for us I think comm is in a summary in this last paragraph on the headed on the head on 14 bar 3 just that it decides it the direction is clear at present the direction the detail about how we get there is lacking and I suppose that comes down to how much it 's going to cost us in that period of trying to do that without having that information it 's typical stuff that sent down from central government and it leads us in a bit of a limbo because how far do you go are you the first council off the rink to go and do as much as you can at a cost and then find out later on that it 's too much of a course or too hard of a deal so Hilary how far do we go yeah and they 're talking pretty quick time frames I 've seen five years so it 'll be interesting to see the next round and what comes through and and thanks Dixie it was a suggested resolution there so um move please I 'm a testicular damn out all in favor I am item number 17 is submission on the freshwater reform I don 't really just mechanical to I 'm afraid I 'm afraid but I questions or have any input into this or perhaps moved and seeking the suggested resolution that you approves of submission on the freshwater reform 2013 mb on I 'll move because again that was talked about their workshop minister and I think this has huge implications for us then then the other one is that true to say your neck or not with the Waikato River and Lake toefl right here mr. chairman just two hour time frame like obviously it 's our elections this year but obviously essential government 's elections next year does that give us a little bit more time to to you know Weaver 's obviously this node not a great day as you say detail come out can we just put it off you know do our submissions but put it off into a little bit or just kind of act a little bit dumb on what they have in until that comes because could it all change after see no elections you know national could get in the gay not my not or does once it 's said in it carries on even once education their professional dota yeah just going to say that I 've been to a couple of the presentations that have been given including one where the minister spoken Rotorua and I think it 's really important going for that councils around the country look to push back on some of these things and actually asked for the detail because that 's right there is a lack of detail and the meetings i went to also the to my feeling the felt like there was a lack of general interest and feedback they kept talking about feedback comment and input and then almost in the same breath we were being told that well this was going to happen anyway more or less so I think the stage I just want to be explicit about that I don 't feel from the things that I 've seen this government is that interested and really consulting with local authorities and the key people who work with this act as widely as they could be within any sort of reasonable time frame I mean this freshwater document for example that we 're providing days or something like that from the time it was published and to win feedback closed so anyway they just I rest my case on that I just don 't think it 's genuine more honest agenda item if not the move on I think of these junk there are ticking come to John to raise a favor I am _"

    "text": "one is mr. Witt again this is a this is an agenda item which you 've all got here you 've read some of you went on a site visit in some dinner on a workshop we have people here that want to talk I guess for ad against this today but I 'll hand over to you mr. red too would you like to add anything to it or take this as read and we 'll ask which I 'll take his red I just want to clarify a couple of things so yes you 're correct there was a workshop there 's a number of councillors attended that site visit we visited both five mile Bay and Keitha place and Kim mock as you recall there was two main sites that that concerns were being raised in terms of cannot reserve the consensus at that time was not to support a closure and a five mile Bay the consensus at the workshop was in support of a partial closure of art of five mile Bay and that is driven primarily from officer level in terms of councils inability accessing that point and to extend there 's a there 's a track that runs basically along the lake from there so primary drive from an officer level was to be able to maintain the reserve now I gather this 33 members of the community of us stand received speaking rights i think i 'm not sure if you 've got a list then wireless tells me I 've got Peter lemon Christine Smith and Lorraine Dale pizzas pizza 's here I 'll hand over to Peter and I 'll um in the interest of time three or four minutes please worship councillors think the opportunity speak I 'm speaking to the motion in regard to the vehicle traffic restriction on five mile Bay reserve I am a permanent resident of five mile Bay they 've been a property owner there for about 12 years and live on the back side about halfway down by the wet area I 'm speaking is the chair president of the incorporated Association of the property owners in friends of 5 mar they rather than as a resident with my own views and that association 's open to all stakeholders I think you 're all very well familiar with five mile Bay a small community of about a hundred properties of roughly which half of them are on the reserve to the south of number 76 this area is closed to traffic and has been this way for as long as we can remember and the rest of the of reserve roughly north of the wetland area halfway down there 's open access to vehicles generally we 're at a minimal community you know pretty well but in my position as chair from all the comments phone calls visits to my home leaders cars on the reserve is the most controversial topic in the area and I think this is demonstrated in part by the fact that there 's lobbying going on now for and against some to protect status quo in regard to restricting vehicles others are happy to work with what council seems to be leaning towards in terms of some improved controls the while these reasons have merit I think against and may particularly apply to a property or a property taking all comments into account the majority view is that there is an underlying an urgent need to address two commonly accepted issues one is the people pedestrian safety issue and the others containment of the damage to the reserve surface which is felt was largely caused by vehicles this was born out again this year at our AGM that was held earlier this year where a subcommittee was elected that I was also appointed to be chair to address the matter of vehicle controls on the reserve with the aim of improvement if possible in parallel with this you conducted your workshop that was advertised in the ER and the in the press for your concert for us councillors the subcommittee is therefore written to council details about its intentions to restrict vehicle access for safety and damage control purposes and to add a general level of support and that something needs to be done in the station where Association will review your response in due course there 's general applaud to counsel for what 's been done in terms of developing the tire first street car park where as it seemed to be a valuable long-term solution at least to the car park issue I don 't intend to go into the pros and cons of pedestrian safety on the reserve hotel council how to address damage on its own profit what I 'd like to say is that the facts indicate to me as chair is that firstly increased numbers of vehicles on the reserve are here to stay are expected to continue times have changed significantly significantly over the last five years and that passed justification for cars or vehicles on the reserve may need revision pedestrian safety now is paramount and concerns in the two areas of damage and safety are escalating particularly it across those narrow parts of the reserve which run the more pressure so I came here today to reinforce councils proposed intention to restrict vehicle access in whatever way that 's applied on the reserve for safety and damage control purposes and seek clarification on what 's being decided this is because its chair I believe this to be the majority view and that the best way at it to serve on reserve before I finish can I take the liberty but just quickly indicating to councillors both the key reasons that i believe the community that i represent both support restriction and the key reasons that though she would not support restriction but one more of status quo with i don 't wish to explain these sacred timer quickly like to list them those in support would generally do so because they recognize the vehicle volume of vehicle traffic is continuing with a significant increase particularly in the last 12 months something like a hundred percent unproven figures they believe it uncontrolled vehicles and people on the reserve direct mix increased damage and high cost of repairs will be pedestrian safety is achieved especially for young children speeding vehicles will be contained if not eliminated and there 's generally an acceptance that considerations will need to be made by all parties concerned they do not generally accept the way that some key issues have been minimalized by some where in fact these are important issues and there are aware also that other reserves on top I 've had to address have worked out satisfactorily those against restriction generally do so because they 're inclined to believe in the reasons such as the reserve is for all they believe cars on mahoota road and proud of their properties will either block up mahoota road which is rather narrow at the best of times or will cause people to walk through the properties to the reserve they believe that people have the right to drive there 's another reason as close as possible to the lake edge because it 's always been done that way they will not be able to continue is another reason to launch their boats on the lake edge but would rather have to travel to a public program I 've had quite a few comments to that degree it 's not often put in writing other state that if the vehicles are restricted then some property owners on the front particularly will have their own Beach this is referred to as private privileges and as a deeply held view by a few they also believe it will make some women even one person 's asked me to in the area outside the property will make at least safe for children by concentrating vehicles in one area others do not agree damages on on the reserve is even a material issue worth worrying them so conclusion I believe that to resolve this at the council to make a reason to decision that regard to the reserve can I suggest that council needs to go beyond just local views and should consider take into account knowledge and experience that it 's gleaned from other reserves and other experiences around the district and then apply this experience to our situation at five more of a and in doing so can I suggest that there 's some key community principles or baileys that we need to follow here one people 's overall safety must be fair enough secondly precedent knowledge and experience from elsewhere must be applied to rise above and go beyond where we have been before and thirdly common sense not prejudice must prevail this way all property owners and Friends of five mile Bay and users of the reserve will be served and council will be applauded for serving the common good of all to operate person visitors thank you very much mr. limit christinith mrs. Christine Smith isn 't hi your worship and counselors I 'm Christine Smith and I have been a rape pair for nearly 40 years and have had a house at five mile Bay 436 I 'm speaking on behalf of 12 other ratepayers who might be able to contact the rest I just haven 't had names and addresses unfortunately there has been a misunderstanding and Peter Lee lemons letter and also his comments today saying that it was the decision to restrict vehicle access to the beach was unanimous is not correct so I sort of in a way I Merlin sense did he said he 's chairman and speaking for the majority I I anyway Paul that be the point we are asking for the status quo we have had one of the drier summers and surface of the reserve has been cut up particularly at the southern end but I believe there are other remedies um out there I don 't know them all obviously John would I don it will naturally grow back aesthetic car park by this i 'm not sure John whether you mean putting my lads up with a car Woods up from the piece of casio let 's see it well they won 't be able to turn around it 's going to have to be a lot bigger because you 're not going to be able to back it out of a static car park turn around and go down the road again that 's physically not wide enough so therefore you 're going to have more toys seal down if you don 't you 're going to end up with a sandpit right round the tar sealed area because you can 't concentrate that many cars in a small area and have the surface maintained mmm the next point I mean John 's basically said what we 're going to say so a peter has at least two parekh both cars on site of my who she rode it 's going to make it a one way road it 's impossible not to do that too narrow as you said the safety a problem my children have run across there as have my grandchildren and heaps of other people 's the people that come to five mile Bay are basically locals and we have heaps and they 've been coming for years they are very considerate and they certainly look up the children I think rabbits more problem at five mile Bay to be perfectly honest with you eating the grass mmm um as an alternative energy are Peter suggested we do support the extension of the tough a parklet scarper currency already and would like to see that extended as an alternative em on the twenty-third of october two thousand and four the council held a private a public meeting at five barbie Bay 70 property owners were there and members of the public yup say well so was i am i 'm sure not 70 people knew about this proposal coming to cancel today the people i rung had no idea mmm so I 'm therefore feel that if you wish to carry on with this proposal you should surely consult the wider community which is the Talpiot people themselves the top oh I see birds and two people i said i was going to count a nice acropolis it closing you know restricting access and they still no no no we go if all the time 25 mar by though people I didn 't know anyway hopefully we have presented a balanced view and that you will appreciate I wishes to preserve the status quo okay well thank you very much i hope you don 't mommy corny call today thank you very much for that I think all councillors do realize that reserves belong to everybody in this district necessary to people that border them or boundary them they belong to each and every one of us including I 've taken my grandkids down there for a picnic so thank you very much and miss de Lorraine hope you off I hope you don 't mind me calling it rain known you long enough all right ok cool mirek counselors thank you for giving me your time I 'm going to make my own brief football before minutes because I 'm a busy person I 've got taxpayer what Peter and Chris have did because they 're basically the pros and cons I have spoken to the majority of people who are involved and have houses along the theory that you intend to cross off block off of collards they are in complete opposition for obvious reasons they don 't want their homes to be a car park placed in front they 've all pointed out to me the value of their properties will drop which I things I realistic the solution for them to come to they are horrified Aventine to inform the iron group of this goes ahead because they have been through it in 2007 I don 't think they expected to go through it again the simple fact measurers for me you either block it off and leave if you 're buying the same position or status quo you can 't just block off in union mating people responsible for that problem thank you she 's time okay thank you all right so so unforgiven it 's got some questions on firstly well what is the cost of putting in bowl ads against the that no matter if we really need to but you know that just rough your top of your head not really the issue here today I think we need to focus on what the issue is here today it would appear to me that we have a divided community in five mile Bay about whether it gets close to public traffic or not close to public but I think if I 've heard something today that 's personal I think it 's a I think it 's a wider public issue than just people that live at five mile Bay it 's all our reserve including myself and makes me wonder and we can we can debate this here for a short while but if we it makes me wonder if we shouldn 't be I think setting up some more public consultation or perhaps another more formal or informal public workshop regards this matter we 're going into winter now so it 's not really a paramount decision has to be made today in my opinion because there 's not thousands of people down there picnicking tonight for daylight common sense we do have to look at maybe next summer as we 're when you forget and I think there needs to be more input from a greater wider spectrum of people it 's not for me to mouth off here all day kilter down at Dinkin Flicka yeah i mean i 'd blame myself I didn 't make that workshop month ago or weho that all was involved in 2007 and 2008 through a huge reserve management review on all our reserves and five mile Bay was was one of them and the thing that can see me also back then as well as Neil is Christine she doesn 't mind you said calm and Christine said that we have had probably one of our longest hottest driest summers and naturally a lot of our reserves are pretty well damaged i know there 's it 's worse with vehicles going over there and then the period of that time where there is a lot of vehicles as just the two week period over the from boxing day through to past New Year 's Eve the biggest holiday time a little bit more consultation and consult the wider community on this that 's my feeling on it I voted against that last time and at the moment I still feel that way but I 'd like to actually develop into it a little bit more and actually even with all the rain I 'd like to go down and visit it now with and see how the growth and see whether it 's retuned but if your hands up i 'm sure i had demon order to counter heckling next being there there and there are just going to say my real concern is that if we probably don 't do anything at the moment i can see it being more or less the same for next year too this is an ideal time to at least try and attempt to get some some with some remedial work done and at least make an attempt to two of the the reserve look in something as it should look all knowing or well that it is on sand it 's not easy to establish a grass cover on that area the site visit we can 't really allow reserves to get damaged so so much we 've yet I feel exactly the same we don 't want to totally closed it off the cars so going out for some you know I think we 've got to think think how we can perhaps manage that a little bit differently might construct a nice walk path down through the year which would give us some definition and then perhaps our grass which would help it to I don 't know become more established because what would it be fair to say council heckling at this very stage we do need to do some remedial work down there most of that 's not an issue we should be doing that yeah I remain alive is another you know we 've got to close it off temporary hit below the grass killer yeah okay so I think you 've got that message and I need to go there they have been there I think Kevin Anderson I was just going to say I don 't defer this I don 't favor to fearing we got the facts before us I think we have I think his community being canvassed to my mind they have going back to two thousand seven as a wide range of views expressed I think councils just get on and make a decision one way or the other just for clarification when white firewalker was followed it off did that go out to consultation we have anything it was a man it was a heart of the 2008 serious yeah can I go Becky I 'm sort of em em under a different impression now than I was during the visit to the site and I just I think we do have a bit more time in outside my type sincerely think I 've actually had more people against this recommendation that I 've heard from people about the bus stop so I seriously think we need to go out for wider consultations I 'm gonna apologize to gentlemen the back of the room i 'm coming to hear it 's mr. samples down there i did give him speaking right and then I learned virtually just cut you then you can come forward and I please accept my apologies Counsell Williams in Celtic it some you wish if I just like to put a query question up to all councillors and there 's do we think it 's desirable for our public reserves to be used for a plethora of cars speeding along reserves running the dogs and secondly do you think it 's acceptable for a large group of children or families plan crack up to him has moving through the middle of them personally I think it 's absolutely so so dangerous and at this issue hasn 't come up just the summer it was last summer as well when these red you hit approaches last the previous summer as well unlike counselor Kirk I must must make some different circles because I attended a barbecue I think it was New Year 's Eve down at five mile Bay where there was 40 people here all local five mile Bay people absolutely furious about situation with vehicles on the reserve and some of the loutish behaviour and all year round i think with the dog the do without that 's mean I think we need to make make a decision under make it quickly because a dog running decision dog running issue especially the car through the reserve a techna you and not to send the summer people on picking that this is a reserve that comes within the meaning of the reserves act 1976 trick shins or reserves but other question I hear there 's a cupboard or does it have the reserve management plan all the time no it 's part of a wider so much Republican at the last try em you remember that every reserve we did the whole lot Oh Helen come to win but I need to ask mr. several that answered your question cancer giver yeah he KMP didn 't them mr. several again I apologize to you if you 'd like to come food for three or four minutes I did give you speaking right and then catch you out to drive my apologies mayor and council consulates five mile Bay will serve as a gym we 've had a whole house over eight years we see the beach front because it 's one of the few places and tether you can but I came up from crisis this morning on an airplane set beside a a woman who 's elderly mother lives in retirement home their favorite thing is to be taken down to the of my bad back on the on the waterfront yeah in Endicott I which is capable of getting out of the care of it to answer this one of the comments from Council on your right if it was came up 2008 and a lot of time was spent and we come to hearing here and was the proposal to enclose cows and the corral that was pathetically rejected as it was in 2004 I wonder have you had the benefit of all the information from the well a reserve management plan from 2008 which was but a lot of the people when you we 're only been there eight years but a lot of people have been there too long a lot longer and they said this comes up as an attempt by a small group of residents to privatize an and I think of a car park was built it would be initially small letting say 20 cars well after the cars would come in couldn 't trying to pack it out onto the road we 've got six grandchildren of a cop-out proposed yes would be right live and it would mean our family would be going across as coming in and out corralled well now that go directly we welcome the cows and one thing that we know for certain most of the people who come to farm obey other people belongs to them it 's pretty special and report from reach Morrison which with me he said that it would be very the properties where any pair craft were built by up two hundred and fifty thousand dollars that we we are strongly opposed to it and we welcome welcome at ours as for our safety is concerned actually go down to the south in family down there and they play there and they then they go across to the beach mostly supervisor unless law most visitors the five now be sensible and I think the very a letter or whether it was distributed all the counselors were recommending that the King looks repairable and they could extend the cap back to the north end up towards the ceiling and I just hope that I 'm glad that you 've got a consultant process because it seems a number of property owners I 've only found out that this proposal was your email or other variants I hope that a really good consultant process takes place thank you very much Thank You mr. several well once again I do propose to you that I counselors in the interest of time and of making the creek decision that a council staff I don 't think that he telling twice look at doing remedial work down there at the moment because it is necessary long hot dry summer check for different we need to go out further with us consult further workshop it more further come to heckling Council down at and myself were involved in this process in the last tray in him it was laborious I think one meeting someone here mentioned today we had 70 or didn 't want it closed sort of hearing both sides now we were we spent a lot of time on that so I just respectfully ask the others that before they make that decision they 're going to have to come on that journey that we went on that fear completely mos def not in your worship what I have a consent through this agenda item until this has been workshopped and further consultation done in in the greater public cancer Henderson I was just curious as you have outlined that you 've done significant consultation before mmm at significant time and costs made out to all consumed and what more could possibly be learned by since you 're repeating that consultation now or what would we do now differently or new to get us a better guess it would get us us new calendar that scientists Caroline that would get us better information or information that we don 't already have available to us about us you get the general public feedback that we did at the time that they do not want it closed off I realized this up did not want this closed down cancel damage you 're not you know sir I 'm open oh my decision back then was no and my decision now would be no unless we have more consultation and then you know I want to be open and transparent that after six years as as Peter said that might have changed down there I didn 't go down to the workshop down the other I want to be completely because I I know this is a huge thing even for me I used to take my family down there when they were young because it was an accessible place that you could park your car and the babies now I go too far a walker because the kids are obviously older but I know a lot of other families that go down there because a baby can stand the car and they can Stewart so one of the few places that you can access so i want to go through all the pros and cons again i think this is too important just to make a decision here today michael when 'll be going back to fight my way like i am now the cycle of life an 18 year old I don 't wish they don 't probably think if I was pushed into a corner today I 'll be quite orange developer i never i voted kids however but it tears again i 'm happy to go through a more in-depth process whatever process that might need to be and i asked you to defer this agenda item until that process whatever that proteases has been adhered to and followed and done I 'm tackling I would port but I really do think that we need as a council today made the decision to start remedial work on that disease it 's mostly male this in public on webcam you know I 've done a lot of work but the prison 's lately the genre prison is now working prison I have the ability to speak to the whatever he 's called bill neither runs a prison they have labor just busting wanting to come out so if there 's remedial work down there that takes physical labor I long as cars continue to us as a reserve weird after temporary I have to tiptoe you when I 'm not wanted to go for a BBQ there tonight yeah suddenly enough we need to make that decision your worship today to perhaps temporary close the reserve well the remedial work is its as a whole reserve need to be closed because of the whole old-lady emanator that comes out and sits there are when a door to take to a retirement home or is it just eerie as we need to ring off and fix that well just as I come to you about companies such as ear is or do we need to temporarily closed out while we get the flick them in order to be able to properly do remedial words we need to close the whole of that that preserve off how long 12 not good you can really have to put them there is the plan you can leave the access road open and and through to the rocks either side and you as long as we can close off so and close it from south you know you know where the quarry sake is by the little turning point you could close it off there through to the south so that you can do that long narrow stretch and then just up on the top further through through the end of the where the end of the tar seal finishes just to get those two stretches repaired surely just okay yep and I take on board what come take control i believe it 's easy enough to do and particularly pick up those rocks and replace them around a wounded areas but hang on counselor Henderson yeah I was just going to quit and the logic of spending rate payer money because you won 't get this done for nothing on a reserve that you may be able to close temporarily or may not but then you may well open up again for more damage to occur on what you 've just spent by money fixing that to me defeats any logic I can possibly imagine it 'll give us time to to consult a little bit further on on the issues that 's I was most incensed when council blocked it off with pollard 's because my right of probably 45 years of driving down there and with my mother they have picnics on the beach was taken away from me however my views changed once I saw how the reserve was in a better state through parking and walking the 10 meters that I had to do I also been going to five mile for a long period and the damage is getting worse each year so the greater good for the long term it needs to have the cars off the reserve in my eyes and I take the debts and experience I 've seen it for a walker is firewalkers a very pleasant reserve now and we do is walk across the road and park and I again there 's space in the pre-existing carriageway for room for cars to park in to install excess 50 metres either way there 's scope through the down in front of the swamp to extend car park that would not affect any houses in front because there 's no one living in the that in the big picture especially with the work by cabos doing with possibly extending the lines walk down to white i knowi that it would be a defined path there but the cars cause a lot of damage so I believe we 've got to make a decision for the longer preservation of the reserve we need to get on and I 'm in agreeance of closing it off maybe with some modification to make it slightly easier for vehicles to I can move around you 'd be happy if their car papers proving front of your house that 's already there it is a you know we 've just allowed cars are not supposed to drive on the reserves in most places yet they have an ability here as serves act there 's a predefined Tomic that is for parking but we put no control stop cars moving on the water did you also gain you know there 's you know too many variables up in the air like the cost of what it 's going to cost to you know look at it surely they must be spend on maintenance and stuff like that does it get swapped to another reserved when one reserve doesn 't need too much maintenance but another reserve is damaged you know I look at the home show Adam tongariro does ooh reserve and the ground got chomped up on that you know that the nail needs you know extra money on it to get done those are the variables that I need and I again need a workshop at the workshops next week I 'll make sure on there you know and then we can address as councillor heckling said that it does need addressing but underneath a Oh our own operations there must be a management plan that they must go through when certain reserves need more maintenance than others so those are the things that all odd want to find out rather than just say right we 're closing it off to maintain it for a year don 't look great oh my god this right is this the only reserve we 've got in the whole district where you can drive right up to the beach no Keith but there 's none up here the northern end of the lake is 21 own up to it so what 's going to happen I just add yes if it 's the only one and there 's this population of holidaymakers and residents of tell post the only one surely the number of people who 's going to increase over the years as mr. lemon said and that 's got a bit of a while if it 's happening like Barry said it 's happening a year before near before the other thing I 'd like to say is we 've got two experts here Alison and john de know how much how long it 's going to take to recover this reserve back to what it was like five or six years ago are we going to go against their advice and I 'd like to just say they know what they 're talking about if John says 12 months so it which stores itself to a grass I think we 've got to abide by these experts opinions can I just sorry too we have a tennis team as mr. Sabel said this went through and and is that management plan that you can read it was really damaged back then too they had quite severe storms that year which made away erosion that ate away at the beach and the residents came up with a plan with counsel to REE REE you know I ridgid a Tory room rehma date or whatever it is and and it did work it came right for the next two years and so you know there 's always going to be times of and I appreciate that last you might have been another year that it got damaged and but those are the things that I want to find out from the last six years just you know is the traffic counter is a lot more as it only over those two week periods I mean how many how many vehicles go on there say from now until the next holiday big period is labor weekend Counsell Williams I would like to congratulate captured Johnson on his eloquently presented argument which I totally concur and I 'd also like to ask let 's start with children pet dogs grandmothers and grandfathers swimmers and people aren 't really enjoying the water what a truly a Rick reserve is meant to be a truly cut a place of recreation and leisure how would how could we possibly support having vehicles with all the extension and exhaust and speed and danger amongst those that particular group and also aren 't we meet to be a cycle Finley go straight and we 're develop more cycle way all the way along to write Hanoi and this and it 's getting more and more use in walkway how we possibly rationalize putting people 's months an area of beauty I just does not thank you well then he 'd been here 42 years in a fits well for me but however that 's just me and I 've spent a lot of time Denny was picked make some babies in cars at separate citroen all people in cars in it but that 's just me so um it would appear to me if it would be push comes to shove it 's going to be a the chair and I 'm going to do it because I 've been reminded that I can I am to fear unless agenda item for a more open honest and transparent robust workshop end or public consultation input to the decision-making process I thank you very much for that you just outlined what you want us to do and there we go do you want a workshop or do you want us to I think it I think we need to have a how many houses on this something here hundred is it ok so I think it requires a notification letter yes no simple process to those houses and I think it needs to be openly workshopped and advertised that way for an open workshop in the chamber here counter demo I 'd like to endorse what counselor heckling has said though Mia records there also we get a costing or the management planned are you how much you 're going to chef there what 's what 's your plan to remit remedial make whatever yet to do it and watch your timeframe and stuff like that and give from another reserve that doesn 't need it to this reserve and what 's the time process to get something done there ok ok thank you very much for now break for 10 minutes please team can we reconvene it 's three o 'clock and move on with the agenda thank you _"

    "text": "it 's party time and the Rotary clubs all SAT all okay so we have we 've got people waiting for both these items and we will stay in order so moving now to mr ridd welcome surged into item number 8 which is a giant boat like sculpture same as the one we have a stop of our control gates up and oh did you want to come up and do anybody else was richard i richard in cath so yeah get tested yep also winter where did we go Keith we went to that 's right that was last year was not here and roses not here so okay Richard and cath and mr. red autism Rose black guitar playing to South America oh good cool i 'll hand over these guys in a second unfortunately I wasn 't_''_65.489 this this went through the terranea tongariro community board when I had man flu so I wasn 't actually present for the item but I 've I 'm aware of the decision that was made so I 'm just going to hand over to Richard and calf will probably try and answer any questions after that thanks John um yeah apologies from rose Blakeley she 's asked me to speak on her behalf and I can 't this here to talk about exciting initiative for bikes in school watch out initiating last year in September we launched the first unveiled the first giant bike and better say it was quite a learning experience building it rose and I have been over season seen many giant bikes and now it just really just sort of it 's the middle put together flipped like a bike what we ended up with was a work of art me Marcel the artist and he 's an artist we built it 661 hours into building the bike which means the budget blowout having said that the budget increased battles actually all donated time material and a little bit of money we the big thing about launching that bike last year was that we learned a whole lot of things about bikes and they can be catalyst we were asked to do it on to any we see the bikers being not just a puppet economic development and get more people to stop now you 'll see them well up and control gates whole their number of people who stop with a photograph taken all over facebook businesses around the country using it to promote themselves secondly to get kids more active and there 's three things we were going to link into this project as a pump track some of the ones power park which kids of all ages zoom up and go around sydney some BMX facilities and thirdly is a bikes and source program which my name is Kip Alfred I with the bike topple my real with a the job as well and if it fight things somewhat we had last year it became really obvious that this districts really good being a cycling destination you 're providing mountain bike tracks and events for riders from out of town but we 're missing a real core group of their own people not writing and this is roses cycling strategy for 290 would get some of their real people on bikes so yes the giant bike draws attention to to Donia we 'm more interested in the kids in the district being on bikes I 'm at the moment with three thousand dollars a year from council help fund it thank you very much I take bikes into schools in Topal I 'm in contact with tongariro school I want to go down there and get those kids riding as well I 've been to why to her knowing those kids in love that 's great I 'm largely volunteer if I do get a little bit of funding to pay for it when you take bites into schools unitive straight for them you just end up with a bike and a helmet and the kids just ride and if we gave kids and two daii more facilities to get on bikes and ride we 're going to be putting stuff back for the local people to ride not just visitors from Wellington Oakland Australia coming and spending their money here so what they need the equipment in the space that 'd be really good to see it 's Richard just said a pump Trek BMX track I hear talk the skatepark bikes and schools idea is to get bike tracks into every school in the district some of you will have met Paul McCardle and he 's gotta trust he works towards getting a cycle track inside the school grounds I 've given up trying to get kids to bike to school and we 'll focus on getting them riding in the first place so tongariro school would be wonderful because they 've also got the asset of the tongariro river trail so those high school kids can get the little ones writing as they get bigger they can go out and low on the River Trail and still not be on the road but still riding so the idea with the spikes and schools as you have white trick inside up to 50 bikes depending on the size of the school a helmet for every child a lock up storage and a cycling champion person to help with your writing and we 'll put the hand up for that I 'm sure so getting kids on two bikes is good for everyone it 's better for their health that 's cars and learn to transport without getting in the car and if i can just indulge it for a while i just had a little story about a little boy here in town his parents aren 't available for him he 's fostered by his photo all five of them are fostered out and he was losing its very unhappy six years old and just just not happy I ran into him with his bike from schools and at the after school program with the bikes and I said to his far no hits this little boy because he loves to ride perhaps he 'd like to go a little bit further and some of the members of the BMX club took him under his wing people donated jerseys and gloves and someone bought him a bike and someone who 's just at the track donated some money to buy a license for him that little boys just turned seven he 's been all around the country riding BMX has extended vmx far no which is one all and Eero to the Nationals and he is going to ride at he 's been on a bike for six months now this little boy was really unhappy throwing tantrums didn 't want to go to school didn 't want to do things and now he 's seems not tall now I 'm not saying that every little kid the district 's going to go to the world BMX champs will do a triple backflip like jeered mildan but having access to bikes and two tracks into parks gives children opportunities it gives our children of all ages something to do in a pump track and a BMX track especially those boys not just boys but girls as well gives them somewhere to go something to build something to hang out with it 's just a 11 all around the place so we 're support from the council on the turn on your community board locally we and with some key people when the district down and to dougie and it 'd be really good to see the great bike yep it 'll be great but I see the bigger picture and seeing those little kids n big kids riding at the track and we great to ever be in mixed track as well thank you very much for that um if the John bikes is much more hope to be a catalyst saying that that people cheering to be proud of ok come to the plate I just is this space where you 're going to put the gel bike for all those other facilities I mean we 're about what about where is a site between the driver posle is just a giant by proposal but what we 're hoping away you can 't list all these other things to happen those other things will happen around town someone by the coffee cart me but um just to focus on the agenda item we 're talking about building a giant bike ok yeah come to Cuba you know just want to signal that I 'll move the suggested resolution there 's just two things here though it 's going to move the other but I see the second door says X number of dollars is that ah pizzetta Mountie does that mean that if it 's going to cost more you the opportunity to if you didn 't want to put 20,000 you might want to put 50 or 10 whatever you decide so it gave you an open this overrides a resolution that was made in December right we made it resolution december 2001 to put three counts of quite a bit of blood wouldn 't now we 've been asked for 20,000 and if council didn 't want to do 3,000 or could be team 8760 I don 't know that 's what you say however this has come to counsel as a recommendation from the two ringy tongariro community board there 's been here through the chair I like to draw your attention to the budget that you have approved for the current financial year and on page 81 it is the fact that there 's only 12,000 left within that budget the 55,000 council in the 55 thousands made up of kind yes I refer you at resolution whereas talking based on the recommendation of the Turangi community board 30,000 be contributed yeah but you 're saying our budget council 's budget for this financially Indian yet just trying to clarify that yet comes in I could be wrong about this but i think i 'm correct when we approved the last budget for the 3,000 the project and taupo for the bike was underway but the full cost of that wasn 't necessarily known as it is at the stage is it 's been quite significantly more than what was expected with the giant bike here and i think from memory when we made that decision about the 3,000 we were working on the original estimate for that which was I think the figures here considerably less wasn 't it so obviously you 've got a better understanding now what cost implications are so just a minute of clarity we put 3,500 cash into the bike on top of the hill yet that 's why going back in my memory that we did the same for to ringing at that time what what mr. in Hannah does point here and you now know your facts and figures more clearly with more clarity and accuracy you 're asking for 20,000 but what must have been headed the packet which genes on jun 35th so it isn 't um yeah I acknowledge this 12,000 there in the budget for this year currently so that 's possibly as I think many and it 's alluding to all that we can actually approve currently I understand I just point out though to that over the past 23 years to 2010-11 12 I think we spent 160 six thousand dollars of public money on public art sculptures to the best of my knowledge all that money has been expended in Taupo it was match though wasn 't it was a dollar per dollar you nice comfy your policies a checkpoint your policy has fifty percent vacations in confirming that yet next question is to to make up the twenty thousand dollars to make the scheme fly and I must add that rose likely in Richard and kept it should be really complemented they 've been right out there trying to get this thing up and going for a long time now and we 're just making some ground on it so the 20,000 that is needed we could take the a thousand now the next budget up first the July budget that budget has not yet been approved it is still out for consultation and until that plan is adopted before the 30th of June you cannot commit on council hickling first encounter dinner I was just going to say I would support the twelve thousand dollars because that 's what we 've got in the present year 's budget but just to comment about the money that 's spent previously we 've only become one right a distant rating area over the past 12 months and so prior to that it was all in TK so that 's why it was spent in tarpon you 're not too concerned about their we 've got to focus on what we 're doing here at the moment you come to them at you know I just I 'll agree with councillor heckling not know we can 't spend any more than what we 've got on the budget these other other avenues that we can probably look at the make bears and later on in the new financial year I don a year 12,000 especially I have to run a meeting and meeting rules which chapter abuser there 's a movement there 's a the motion to supply twenty thousand dollars to be too much has already been moved by Councillor Kippur if it doesn 't receive a seconder at fall or I 'll ask for the seconder then it can go then it can be spoken for against and then if that happens it can go back to motion between someone else up twelve thousand or some other but what I need to know from you mr. been here if your governance team here today we 're just checking and where to move to 20,000 how does that work as counsel counsel will have to approve 8,000 unbudgeted expenditure if it has a mind to do that cannot do that do that if it 's got a mind to do it so to run the meeting okay comes innocence yeah um I hear the issues around the budget and what 's there this year and last year but my question is if they 're does the cases have now appears why was a motion put before the tyrrhenian community board which I moved to expend 20,000 which technically we aren 't able to without doing unbudgeted expenditure and if that was the case appears to be when the community board actually made that decision they weren 't made aware of their I can 't answer that it wasn 't there contra keeper perhaps I can speak to firstly I 'm gonna stick with the Eva the 20,000 because that was what the board recommended and I 'm obliged to run with the Board 's decision the second point I want to make that money is incoming forthcoming this project will probably fall over and as I said after all the diligent work that has been done on this project I 'd hate to see it fall over the other point I wish to make as we 're the statues and tended to be cited as right by with a coffee Carter 's just over the tongue town side of the tongariro bridge on state highway 1 this is becoming an area that is really popular for breaks and so on things like jump parks and so on oh that 's we 're going to be part 2 of the next stage of the revitalization and as regards jumps and those sort of things this area is not being identified for that purpose but it is right on the river trail with the revitalization that 's going on at the moment providing the footpath to allow bikes to go under the underpass outside the main road in tutoring the Pyongyang so this area as has increased an activity that will continue to increase in activity I can only about support it that we use the existing 12,000 out of the existing budget and that we go five thousand unbudgeted a thousand in my mind is a small amount of unbudgeted money compared to the amounts of unbudgeted money that have gone through this council since I 've been sitting on the sea yeah well thank you can see kipper but just before I take your questions and it 's also just being pointed out to me boy must do any no and mr. green here and I 'm pointed out to okay there 's no what are the actual dollars that are going into this project I can see here we put their time down on that and I can see that but let 's let 's focus where 's the dollar for dollar input in this one we 're putting 20,000 to build that statue over there whatever it is they put in 20,000 this is the point of mr. me you have a policy in council now you want to go against their policy that 's up to you just two issues when your policy and seek of us how much is in the bucket now nobody 's not denying it 's all good to have jump packs and all that stuff we 're here here yeah I 'm too innocent yeah we 're that 's policy um I just question whether there has been applied strictly to the 166 thousand dollars already expended on scholars dinner ah so that 's been all met Donald it every vessel Remy I this question lass and so it 's all been me at dollar for dollar on the king and this expended until that 's matched dollar-for-dollar and real cash Tim 's from he said the issue cancer as there as the real cash to him so when you look at the chart for what the costs for the total sculptures what I 'm not clear on and Richard you might go to clarified as how much of that was was a real money rather than unkind we only matched real money and then be okay how much was design which we don 't need to be prepared until only because you 've really done the design for the top ones and a half thousand dollars in cash our businesses see we will order had no engine into the engineering a couple dollars the engineering design of a doctor after the same for sure anyone paranoid she kept her partner half a dollar promisee will paint the bike view and one see if you 'll transport for you who use our crane for you I didn 't give the chip contains a cash 7 1 half double dollars risk this is and we were hoping that businesses and cheering you 'd community support you accusin behind the scene actually at the post are going to excel or without funding agency and I 've been counted Williams and council head so that 's seven eleven thousand and coin was it donated boy during a business 's reading part of a fundraising for the for you Richard to clarify was at three and a half thousand council contribution in three and a half thousand that you 've got else that you got from someone who even seven on top of the three and a half days you actually make sure so much fun to do one right I mean we in of course the demon realize it was gonna be this is only a work of our gonna cost a lot more then we started going to local business and saying would you support week here people come into ass see our partner with a policy and a bucket of money and I 've been a robot rude I was over here too much an antenna counselor Kirk here if I do this just through the cheer ass counselor keep it as the and why they was lip stain someone abstain from voting I remember either one of the TT community board even wrote letters to the newspaper wasn 't it ok well the queer other question through the floor a further jet there was an opportunity member that was I can tell you the abstention he 's he has previously feed that local businesses could produce a bike but the bike that I 've seen that he 's dragged around on this trailer is just as Richard described before just an ordinary little push bike now just getting back to the the money side of things again when we went to answer my questions yeah just just a question please cure I Celtic I am they didn 't divulge why they publish is of a public knowledge who abstained yes it 's in your hand they 're both of terrain took 11 is another cancel another board member was quite vocal in my newspapers and everything win this one went up up here and now vote is now voted for it okay that 's on to that question please dinner was counter yeah and I wanna yeah and i would like to stick in bed and I 'll do it on this basis that I understand that impex dozen kind but are we being too pedantic here because an actual fact if I was curved no engineering or one of the others class what has to stop me giving cash and then sending a nun voice on as long as we 're trusting that this is a regional brokerage i would i would not question it hesitation on mum and believing what these figures are from from the bike thomas group the giant fight group you know as long as we believe that those are realistic i think we are being pedantic and and making less own kind donation not seek services for intensity cash and then finish for the Memphis me a little bit gum come back to health care I really am struggling with those 55 days and IRET you in your booty boat one I see the majority of the 55,000 us 33,000 to Marcel and while the question viewers was just including GST or plus we live in into about 65 Graham Marcel 's about us anyone want me saying does it didn 't he gave us a quote to build a bike he know it 's been a 661 hours off so did you know that other business what we 're saying is we we don 't Annette sustainable in a second bike we want him to be the artist ela second one just wanna say fantastic reviews earthy so good we think is only going to be identical is it gonna be different again she and she cutting an all-out come it 's better say when we first came to council will come here for one bike and you this council after 42 by it 's really for three and three and a half green leaf on your wishes yeah we 've done I just have one further thing to say and then supporting the suggest the resolution is that when we did become one rating we had a million-dollar sitting in the forest refund which we had to hand over we would have used that at the time to build this bike well what about 't expect any response to that council heckling Oh Richard do you think there is a good opportunity of the community or getting more funding out to the community in to arrange for for this project is evenly inclined and I think got a huge advantage in terms of the environment the project by saying really helped build it build support in terms of raising money from tyranny I think we 've got a long as we can we give some stuff in closer so do do you will they should we say that 12,000 but we 've got in our present budget a good start if you wouldn 't put it on the back burner because you 've not got enough money we have to have 20 like we really was try and get Marcel from money this time it wasn 't other other artwork we know thatís look he paid counsel a crate think I so to get emotional so we are one district what we did what has happened in this end of the district should be replicated in the other because we did vote on it on the corner of YP road and thing and I 'd like to second Gary 's original I 've already got a thing when you got a second okay so do you counter in while I support this and I might move the original motion to ya suggest that we recommend that we consider 20,000 there 's one question I just want to raise and I 've left this to last as I am surprised but given that we 've been through this exercise already and given that the first time it was gone through and tap o the costume that being significantly more than it was originally talked about that second time around we don 't actually have a detailed breakdown and what it actually might cost was just a just a twenty-thousand-dollar lump sum but there 's no detail about because I mean one of the questions kick me out of my head is what n kind services would you you need you get this done Andy Murray there 's another detailed breakdown of it okay Bri the chair just did oh yeah there was just my point exercise we might have hit some well there is some in kind of trance we did we have even got a wish in prison Demi I mean three truckloads of sorrel 8am dollars with the floor I 'm a little bit concerned halibel construction now Fred which for me about it so try to track preparation has dig in the hole for the footings um I can get some of John Key 's gifts out to help you dig the hole the other one I 'm a little bit did CAD no engineering honestly Chad you guys 5350 backs the engineer and to put just in the glam because I put up big signs yet so I ssangyong dealerships are things I know how much my engineering bills are they really charged if I Jennifer device actually sitting around these and engineering and tombs of wooden loading we 've got a second on the floor it was moved it was seeking it counted em I 'll take your last one before I put this motion if that you were to fall over we could go to a second motion which goes it becomes unbudgeted and you have the right to do that as governor did your hand up comforter oh I just um like to say that I don 't like to go against on the community board when they make a recommendation and you know we that 's what we 've got them down there to give us a steer and advice but and I know councillor Williams said it we 're being pedantic but we have got a policy we went through a horrendous long-term plan in our annual plan and chopping in and you know being harsh on on some of the allocations and money and I feel so I can 't go outside that twelve thousand dollars left in this budget this year I just feel it 's my responsibility as a counselor that we can only spend what 's in a budget and I 'm quite happy to spend that 12,000 and then work towards trying to look at other avenues that we can do that match our policy and our budget and then also try and come up with the 20,000 that 's just your hand please does anybody or hurt a lot of speaking for the motion does anybody else want to speak against the motion is on the floor against place I 'm with Mike Costello the budget is 12 it 's a whole separate issue to go and spend another eight needs to be debated I can 't endorse a recommendation when we outside the parameters of what we have to work with them I 'm comfortable with spending the money in Turangi but motions that stands we 've only got 12 and it 's asking for 20 it doesn 't fit I 'm you asking against the motion at the moment counts in person so if there 's we go there so what 's the two council saying that is just the fall of you would support the 12,000 which is budgeted for and within the policy parameters ok cancel Hector yes I would support both counselor down I and councillor Johnson on the twelve thousand dollars that you 're going to have to vote against the motion it 's on Ellen DeMayo will be voting against motion masses pop-up an absolutely fantastic job and but I too will be voting gives us motion I just don 't the creation of the total giant bite to me it 's not enough information to truly be able to spend money that we don 't have so um no disrespect to you personally it 'll probably break against it as well I 've just come to consumerism is there any chance that the top amor on a rotary club gamma wanna through the bike challenge she 's going to put anything into this could they put up the other eight thousand can you can you should always carefully can you see what the counselors who are wanting to only approve to 12,000 dot can you see where they 're coming from him and do you appreciate that innocent mmm just clarify i move the original motion for twenty thousand dollars on the understanding that we were actually able to give their money the community board at the time they decided we 're not aware that that would part of that would have to be done as on budget expenditure so not knowing was incorrect what I know now given that some of us would have to be done as own budget expenditure and given that if it was we don 't actually have a specific budget presented to us for this project I do think it would be irresponsible to approve the other eight thousand dollars as well so I support putting the 12,000 towards it but I 'm most concerned that when we actually discussed the sub community board level the discussion certainly wasn 't as deep and complex as this one has been here because not all effects were necessarily before us I counted every conscious or email account and mr. green is asked just want to enter follows on from that discussion from the counselor I guess in terms of what happened the TT board and the way that we 've always played with the plate we 've always viewed the sculpture money in the past is that it 's a first-come first-served basis but often the decisions are made to fund something some even years in advance of the cheek being returned so if you think of some two years at least by the time the council made the resolution to to spend the money it was two years later that we actually wrote the check so of course it was out of the budget two years later that we write their Chi so you 'll see in between has every right when you 've got 12,000 left us year but we do have 25,000 next year in the discussion that was at the borders there 's no way this fights gonna be they built in there for the chief required prior to first of July and so therefore understand what must mean he 'll incentives and money 's not not confirmed in the ant or go through that the altitude fever that was the basis done that for every sculpture that we 've had to date it 's been the decision has been made and the money has been put forward but we haven 't written the check until okay well contact them I just like to comment in those first three or four years we had a hundred thousand keep in mind now that we are know in most day you know from prior we was able to probably think we was it still got sufficient money in the budget to be able to do in Spears at the moment now we 've only got the 25,000 tons of humor and you 're just a relation to and comments made by misty anderson have not been aware of the budget and with wasn 't suitable do so we are the policy that you need to come up with when they may get decision yep discussed yeah well I really want go ahead i really think you guys are doing a great job I will be supporting others with our policy and our budget which tells me that the numbers will fail but i will put the original resolution unless you too would like to withdraw it and move in a second that we give the twelve thousand dollars because i think if i put the motion it will probably fail 54 or a number like that mostly me record be happy if you put the motion as it is the 12,000 plus the 8,000 and put 'll have another patient you 're moving not 12 now you 're moving to removing them because that 's what the board recommendation he really recommend EU council a clip I 'm just clarifying what you have moved you are moving the first part of 20,000 be contributed to the creation of a giant bike sculpture entering as per the Turing a tongariro community board recommendation 509 three dated my paper and it was taken it by Chancellor Williams I 've been there in the room and less than the mostest talk I personally won 't support that I 'll be supporting the twelve thousand dollars as their policy and budget but if you wish me to put the motion i will put the motion to put the nation i hereby pulsation and clear show of hands please to support moved by Councillor i kept a second account sir william all those in favor please one two three the motion force would you like to move and i think it would probably pass but what I 'm really here that the last resolution here where it says X put the me clarify ink or plus GST please secondly single don 't know I see GST okay so council I kept a twelve thousand dollars plus GST be contributed to the creation of a giant bike sculpture interior would you like to move that motion gesture your plus well it depends the party who receives the funds avail GST registered then we can claim back the GST they are not GST registered then it 's 12,000 inclusive of GST GST back off you right so it 's 12,000 plus GST now I ask again do you want to be the mover of that motion Celtic ever wish the new detonation in seconded Counsell Williams all those in favor say aye all right Kari thank you very much I do sincerely I know speaking on behalf of everyone here I sincerely hope that we can get this to happen and not fall over somebody because we out here into our budget and policies which we are doing groove is strictly at the moment for obvious reasons that I 'm sure you know about because you live in to have it thank you very much three months _"

as I understand it 's financially on track there has been some issues with some cables that were found to be in the wrong place which are necessitating some design changes so the landscaping in the visual look of it the accounts staff might be able to update counselors a little bit more on that sounds like have it up very very nicely but some all on track both financially and end in terms of time and there is the one minor issue which is not a significant one or something that that happens in produce funders refiner mr. structure you didn 't know existed but yeah it 's all on track in

myself and others being then moved on a second the police move comes with Johnson I 'll second them all those in favor all right any matters arising from tahoe airport authority committee of interest Counsell Williams I 'm too bad to the action point this response from a new zealand relation to the east way to Maine to services and an out-of-focus regards to the costs you heard about the action point at the bottom of to Bertie writing a letter to John but it could end his own yes that letter has been written that a very well-constructed letter mostly done by mr. Mahina and councillor Johnson pointing out that how important the air services to taupo I how we would not wish to have any reductions how we think going forward into the future in New Zealand will be better serviced by things we 're doing at the airport and things that are happening in taupo such as Department of Conservation moving 44 staff members and Sabo they always seem to be in Wellington so that will bolster the service certainly tapo wellington so one of a bit of work and i think at this stage it be fair to say comes with john to you can comment I to be fair to say that we 've got a very good relationship with their new zealand a very good service coming into coming in and going out of tempo and i think it 'd be a long time before anything other than the status quo eventuates but have to agree i think the product doesn 't the Suffolk committee and make maintain that relationship keeps us sort of on the radar that we serious about our Airport into the benefit of brings communities okay there 's nothing further arising from those minutes we 'll move down to councillor Truman 's representative Gupta manga keno poor Connie ripped in a group are the only amendments to those minutes before I ask for Mirotic that being then driver mover please move cancel Truman seconded Council heckling follows in favor any omit any matters arising from those minutes please any comment comfort women movie now too management committee any amendments to those minutes they go through to particular council down add all those in favor I buried any of many matters of rising pleas from those minute any comments from the chairperson come to dinner no I 've just got a letter back from the Honorable Nikki Kaye I 'm 23 a letter that we sent three the generators and talking about the rule for being amalgamated nationally they are concerns on that and also volunteering volunteers funding for our volunteers to get trained so I 've only just got this today so I have a read of it I 'll report back on it thank you very much and one final one councillor kippers committee to any tongariro community board of the ninth of April and amendments to those please you know member to ask for a mover and seconder move with the recommendations and the resolutions they are in the recommendation 50 annoying trees the subject of my temple council yep great and a second the police council Henderson all those in favor I carried any matters arising and I guess that matter is going to arrive shortly so any other matters other than that very much maybe now to agenda item number three the lake taupo protection joint committee agenda item number three any amendments or anything to adopting these minutes please the amendments for them I move up move counselor Henderson or without it there meet him but I 'm happy to second it there 's some good news in his merciful counseling Edison would you like to extrapolate on the very good news that was received at this particular meeting with i 'm sure the joint committee received the news that the government had agreed to grant the extra day of approximately 3 million dollars to complete the work of the trust to remove twenty percent of a night reduction target finding this decision count council here as previously agreed to release the funds that we 've held in reserve and been collecting for the right player and there needs to be some decisions made by counsel around there as to the timing of that there is a workshop coming up with the trustees in the joint committee about that and I 'm not sure about the timing staff might have s that so it was really all it was report out of it but great news that the money has been received and real benefits of a lake and district very much counter Henderson so the twenty percent reduction of nitrogen is now fully funded even though now think it went see the scientists nailed it down for 186 aight sweet done i think alike that one of those is correct and they do have an asic fundings in place and it is hoped by the joint committee that that project will be finished by the elections this year so i think well done thank you very much any other matters arising from that those minutes press ok there being none all the people from the city Phineas citizens club here now don 't want it to be here still waiting for a couple that 's fine and okay we 'll just move on that 's fine so moving our pleas to agenda item number four pretty much a mechanical item it 's also our existing contract death so we 've got mr. Lewis here if you would like to take could you have any you have anything you 'd like to add to it mr. Lewis you worship nope pretty straightforward is not really okay but it has to be okayed by governor so it 's a big contract it 's an existing contract existing contractor who I understand from you sir you can give us as governance some sort of reassurance that it 's a good contractor with a good service from them so we don 't need to we don 't need to dig much further than that do we find any further questions questions go in William joyful as Louis um I mean it looks very good take this teen about decent decent was any problems of fear and fear and reasonableness and tender process when the other tendras or the tenders were kindred on my five year basis but the winning tendra has been sleepless on a seven year between the document provided for alternative tenders that the alternatives were specified that was up to individual tenderers to nominate your alternative providing they supplied ur conforming tender which this tender did anything brother it of clarifications second all those in favor I carried thank you again mr. Lewis true and the hot seat sir agenda item number five Higgins contractors for road maintenance and resealing and you like to take that as read and no comments from you sir Getty straightforward and my new you wish of it and of course just suggested resolution is if I may use my wits your recommendation to us any questions of mr. Lewis don 't regret mr. Lewis can we ask you what 's the situation between the funding amount and what spent on ETA or what spent on y aki drive and state highway 1 how does that fit in with the tender tinder allows for maintenance on why Ricky drive and Napier road when we take control of that no with those know for sure yet but we 'd built provision in to the contrary that we would take control of it at some stage during that contract period and we 've allowed for them then up writing a slower set they have to have it to a certain standard when it does get handed over so the major cost will be associated with maintaining the street furniture signs each market posts in vegetation interim what if there 's no further questions of clarification literature that I don 't have a mover police that the contract for Road mountains free ceiling as submitted by hugging contractors be accepted counselor crack move second account to Johnson all those in favor I carried mr. Bowden sir mr. Bowden for those who don 't know has been the strategic project manager for the operating and the refurbishment works of the AC buffs which this triennium of governance found itself encumbered with so mr. Barron I see you have your agenda item here for this of this stage our note that worked in a huge limited are the contractors of choice that we 've already been using yes that 's correct your worship side you on extrapolate or anything or just open for Queen really the the report is as red as per council resolution 5134 from maybe reef council meeting we agreed we would only go to Watson used based on their experience and good performance on stage one works of highlights quantities of a zestimate it 's 2538 146 excluding GST the tender came in at 25 to 32 44 in other words 16,000 less the quantity surveyors estimate that 's good estimating and good tendering in my opinion shouldn 't be suspicious Tim yes we 're all the book suspicion so that 's basically we have achieved building consent while their design or the stage 2 whoops that 's with me at the moment so it 's just a matter of any questions any more information needed one for me mr. Barron and we as a council appointed counsel to Craig Counsell heck may encounter Williams as a sort of a subcommittee making sure that everything was you know we 've got a lot of history these AC buds and we were trying to prevent becoming another part of it what is there been any any involvement with you your three more mini sub committee in this item not and are you guys comfortable very comfortable with if there 's any questions come to dammit I 'm sorry dammit I just obvious separate mr. Bowden just on stage 's open you had much feedback from the users having I have both internal of the council and external as well we have a positive feedback the place looks a lot idea of course a lot of the cost of the project can 't really see cuz it 's above the ceiling and the new roof but I 've had that the comments to the place looks a lot fresher and a lot more a lot cleaner a lot more inviting so we 're both quite a bit of positive fever what a bit like weakness and the place as a dissipating quite good news yeah I 've noticed I 've been looking at the external windows to the building the new ones where we 've taken the air conditioning and push the air towards it and I 've seen very very little conversation so far we 've yet to hear winter and expect it to be some but I looked the other day when it was a particularly cool morning and the baths were operating and the air conditioning was going and I saw very very little indeed and before so i think the internal environment is a lot more healthy than it was previously and most definitely is not the risk of anything for them from the roof ceiling a drop it up you just as an aside I 'm Troy consecrate just as an aside winners project is finished is just going to have a somebody that 's got a proper working manual of this place that does things daily weekly monthly yearly to make sure that the systems are working and we 're not you know heading towards another cliff again like the previous project by ten years ago we will add operation and maintenance manuals as built documentation warranties and guarantees producer statements from suppliers contractors and the consultants in a in a compendium that will be able to be used from the facilities management perspective I think does that answer your question I just didn 't like there could be able to be used I don 't want to tell it will be a fun week and I will be able to be used at the moment there 's previously those there 's that I realized and I wasn 't going to bring that up because but it 's why I brought it up the other way and I don 't want to see that happening again one count to the quake and suburban come with yourself snapshot to question what the attendance figures being like since we opened our we up have no idea to be honest me no change no change so it was never was never thought that of what they break Council Hickey Andrew if we accept this tender today when is the intended date for the start of the works I 'm a sixth of month yeah that will be preparing the site ready for demolition and also providing a safe access for users of the pool from the bottom of the staircase through past the private Sparkle we need to address situation because around that there will be significant amount of demolition so we are applying I 've applied for sure you have you definitely applied for a cpu for that so that we can continue the public to come down the staircase through a horrid origin for public to still be able to access the indoor 25 min to boo ok canceled on I 'm sorry comes Williams just like that I think that what 's in Hughes have done an outstanding job on stage one I think and in really well with you mr. Bowden just I would recommend to cancel though that the Memphis of the public and stakeholders that we continue the working party arranged or nothing was a good conjure up between on a number of levels between the public end and the project team but also just just there other council has been to earth day if I would suggest that I mean I 'm not necessary science the same group that at least three councillors continue to take an overview and I think also another benefit of what has been that it 's able of your time as well with mmm many people want they briefed and be assured that the projects going unless there 's any resistance from fellow council accounts you why not i 'd like to see the existing committee stay there to the end of the job I don 't like seeing shifts changing cooking stations until a spectacle so I 'd like to see you guys stay there and oversee this to it to the end including as I mentioned before that these produce statement everything that there 's some sort of manual that somebody is responsible for I don 't keep its daily weekly monthly there 's a certain things I have to check because it was sadly lacking in the past we 're not going there that 's for the rear vision mirror going forward we need to make sure that those things are in place to protect that asset ever to be very valuable and it expensive to run asset and I don 't read to remind anybody that that so unless my fellow councillors have anything to say other than that we will leave that as the status quo with you three on that on that subcommittee please so do I have a mover for that than all that excitement move council heckling second encounter Williams just for clarification before we were at the allowance of 150 k was that it was 250 did we go internet we have got into it yes but we haven 't used the whole 250 so you 've got a lower amount because you don 't don 't expect there to be the quantum of variations that there were work down the perfect absolutely and some of the work such as some of the seismic strengthening was added on during the course of the project well as this included in the scope of works within that figure and a figure no would it be fair to ask that if there was any necessary Mississippi to get into that 150 thousand dollar next dig for unforeseen work that we could be notified by email as soon as possible so we 're not kept on back yes I issue updated cost reports at the moment to counselor Williams of am happy to issue that to anyone so there was moved to a second there there was a question of clarification all those in favor I carried thank you very much um I will the senior citizens people here that are interested in this lecture dude item at the number seven I see there 's a lot of people interested in this Senate I 've taken it as read and to me it makes absolute sense that I 'm sure it does to the rest of my counselors however I 'm open the floor up to mrs. Raleigh and he can address us and if anybody asked would like to say anything they 're more than welcome to miss Rory um this is fairly straightforward procedural item the senior suits wish to wind up their operations on the Tom Rio domain and divest themselves of a significant built asset that 's on council led thapa rotary have expressed an interest in taking on the ownership of the building and the ongoing management of it and to do that they require release in the land under the existing lease to a senior citizens doesn 't allow for its assignment directly to rotary so what we 're asking for permission for today is for the senior citizens to surrender their lease to allow them to transfer the assets to rotary and poor Council to give out a new lease to rotary I know there 's a lot of interest here but is there anybody from taobao citizens club would like to speak or are you quite happy with we were and so and you 're speaking for who yep comfort by all means please you need to speak into the mic so it 's not the freshest acoustics in the world in here I know I can see her as my bed mr. Gordon clout I couldn 't see you damper back sorry Gordon that 's all I 'm not doing hey idea okay and we had the shall we say the funeral service of the senior citizens this morning and I have been involved with the right from conception 1972 and that I will I had my practice downtown and one of my clients was jim Himes who knows Jim Hanes browse entirely and jevon won the contract and he was a client of mine in k to be self Gordon he said I just got the job for the senior citizens club I 'm building it this is in fact I 've just few minutes ago just written out that 's where I 've come in and over the years I 've been involved mainly with the auditing side and today as i mentioned to the to the club that not to be glum about it in fact I I asked them if they 'd all put a smile on their face because out of Death Comes life and I see the the Rotary Club taking over as another phase existence in moving on to great things the town I 'm sure they will be a great help in them fording the social work and the every other type of work that service clubs do for the community in say i presided over the death today but i told the members to be positive let 's not be negative so much negative using the papers and so on and I made them all put a smile on their face and I went around the room and all of them had a smile on their face I would commend this takeover by rotary to them to the counselors and near thank you very much mr. Clayton I 'm not true since we met in 1971 a great person for the community you have been and I think I think you 're my point of view and I 'll be a couple of questions I 'm sure and comments from counselors but it is certainly another chapter in the rich life of that building and I think Roachy are and I 'd your people to maintain it look after it and keep it available to all s affected them and places of the community to hold gatherings etc so thank you very much Gordon and yep I don 't see any reason why anybody should be glum about it that 's for sure sounds like ooh I just like 2am peacefully think all the members of the title of senior citizens association for everything you 've done for the community over the last forty one years and I 'd like to move the suggested resolution I have a movie there does when we can stop not asking questions raised my debt Christian or second or both if you wish Cubs learn adjuster endorse what you said I couldn 't think without to take it out and then won 't you are you hadn 't be biased would you kill it can I just have yes sir can I just have clarification on the ownership of the buildings land belongs to us and the building belongs to the building will belong after today to the Rotary Club what 's the official name knocked out by they have to maintain it look after and keep it open for public use this is for we own the land underneath that we need to give them a new lease to pack their voting off yeah legally they because the building is attached to the land the building is owned word for the lease the lease was to expire now the building ownership of the building would revert to council become a council asset for council in to deal with which is why we need to deal with the transfer of ownership of the building con senior citizens collaborative ownership of it I virtual release to rotary because we don 't really want to run very very positive step for this beautiful community so if there counselor credit or give you that on and being a vegetarian get it over second especially a Rotarian with a poor fellow 's honor on your on your lapel DC so all those in favor of a zombie yo I carried thank you very much _"

    "text": "give item number 19 I believe everybody is aware that council of india resigned a couple of weeks ago and this item it gives the options of what are available to us under the local government act not under any thing that may be in our minds it 's simply extrapolated out of the local government act we do not have to have a violation because of her under 12 months out from an election in fact we 're not even allowed to have a bond actually even if we wanted to I wouldn 't think it would be a desire to spin rate payers money doing that for three month period and it points out some issues that we may be able to fill the vacancy if there was a desire to do so etc etc so Miss Jake 's I 'll hand over to you I 'm not your futures won 't take it with and with the counselor asked questions all over absolutely do you want two edges where I 've seen or would you just wide open no I think you come up that very well not okay so i had to end up their first comes Williams in come together is some ants of democracy you wish a five a proposed a third option to resolution be doctor I will be an edit and that is that that the heart the next highest pollen candidate and the elections 2010 be appointed I just comment on the expect that would be contained in part of your process so you decided you want to fill the vacancy one of the things you need to do as disciple two criterias you want to use and you would use their visual criteria for appointing team so that suggestion of the resolution can 't_''_121.57 go to complain in the option to as the proceeds so it comes Williams wanted to a point where point candidate from the last elections that comes under options to each other if the government council will enter into the process to an appointment eligible fish to fill the vacancy credit or encounter expensive resignation from council on the big the map to them d so if council of Williams has that desire that she just she would have to go to option to tell you say come to do so um sex you saying that some x-ray impossible and local government aid or under a local government roles that I cannot add a third option only early what electrum it gives you the two options which are specifically either to a point or two there 's nothing in there which says you have to appoint a the next eyes upon the candidate so through our appointment process that 's how you determine eligibility criteria would be so you determine what to determine that you want to put somebody with a and go public notices that you 're there to come in criteria are using the leading post next highest quality and abilities ancient culture culture room and yes what was due respect I don 't have said that because I I don 't like I don 't favor the autocratic notion of this council like hangouts a board of directors and then a controller that could potentially chose somebody for these specific skills I think that we should be seen to be listened to the a third option so yes myself come to dinner like to move option the more I have a member for option number one that pursuant to section 117 3b of the local electric actors as ones no encouragement be made to fill the extraordinary vacancy on council created following council rep dimensions resignation on council on the theme to match 2013 which means that Walker has one peddler short r2e elections she 's gonna worship I moved it and you can ask for a seat enough I 'm going to respond to you move a resolution center well you can only move one or two if I make the reservation and too interested option wheat vegetable and I see that I store one potential that and i would like to thank you can 't_''_299.32 do that can she do a little hoppers jacks well in terms of the process the presses that you would follow would take into account the harbor highest quality education my mother again read that promote resolution thing Counsell Williams and I will look for a think that because you I 'd rather be right down the next highest pollen Canada and the local government elections 2010 be appointed and we 've always took them that the work that 's the meaning the words can be fine will yield a refiner what you want I 've got so far that the next highest pollen candidate be appointed probably take that on that we go thank you for a thousand and ten elections 2010 electric be a point okay that is well known as well you gotta tell me what 's real world don 't know the guys from the UM it 's from down capital elections hang on i grow more turbo coin during minicamp accounting for memory is it going to college isn 't to seek a war so doing a resolution means moon for Counsell Williams that the next highest pollen candidate be appointed from 2010 elections property k waters over broad and fell out differently it 's a fun sport where does this bento probity k-12 felt yeah Carol it 's from FL by 24 ok so to fill the vacancy created following council Rex bunch of resignation from Council on fast to a sick of the place for one more time for a second to the resolution please it 'd be another resolution falls on our take the resolution moved by Councillor downer which is option one on your page to agree that forward no appointment be made to philly for ordering bacon to your council created following culture expensive resignation on the themes match 2030 does that motion have a second the place sticking with councillor Johnson does anybody want to speak against the motion that 's correct eating protocol ugly so therefore I went well according to expect for the motion what 's right you say you 're speaking against me I yes I am and I 'd also like to run people to the public attention that that 's been discussed that the celery overcomes for its lunch be shared amongst the existing counselor as per their apartment under the end yeah I think that goes without you can I tell but that goes without saying because this council at the start of its tree and even the interest of wanting to work as a cohesive team I decided take the pool and divide it amongst the people of the pool which is all of you so it would stand to reason sense of resignation on much the 13 that money will go back in and pull and be divided amongst the surviving lots of Bones wrong with refer a family sorry are there her manian councillors um nobody should be sorry requirement from the ring information authority it 's in the way so they that 's a that 's gonna dust it right and fine so nobody else wants speaking whatever begins to motion at that what does any information or just going to make fun just hard to survive oh ok you wish my hips bucking against the emotional because I advise I 've made clear that I don 't think Phelps and one was written necessarily in foreign the Democratic protease with people spoke the last election that 's awesome and I got one thing I 'm hope I just really do hope i really like a man when a public arena we both need you in a favorite picture I sincerely hope we are following it to the boat we have a movement taken that all those in favor please say aye I got a little for I will call for a show of hands please peplum German kept up download Johnson and Chancellor Henderson against counselor arm Williams move them to agenda item number 20 g52 the operative report with the wind wait check yo I 've leave the report has tabled just to subside it in this match report in courses draft annual player or the the completion of the draft and implant our transportation to highlight the fact that the Sterling amount of work remember the involvement we managed to reduce the projected ltp increase of seven point three eight percent down to fourth floor center just to make a note that projects are all progressing very well financials positions is very strong the start of the room and mr. Mandela for answering questions with myself okay now two or three council meetings must mean tenant has asked many times if there 's any questions and his financial so he can be prepared to ask them would you please email them through now open up to the floor comprehensive I 'm over the first page refers to delays and summarizing all works will make became sentient let us insert another financial considerations I know discussions are ongoing but is there an even up any update you can get on however it 's progressing because I if I know some classes might give an update on that we have now received permission from the territorial marrow transport the owners of the late bit of good information to do the replenishment work at Korea which will be all go ahead we have a meeting not much money that with monday we have another meeting with the car generator at zero or the products vary in the very near future there 's three on the committee with you myself and come to the curb i 'm meeting a given to power generators to come to an agreement excess of financial input of the three parties work at originally council power zeros and SMS in our me have that consensus course all content or and blessed it 's simply a matter of sitting on the table of meat could I ask you your worship what you are around advocating how company shot players this year I don 't think what you just wrote out in the public arena that some that 's working with its confidential negotiation but provided we don 't sell quick confidential agreement or anything like that i 'm betting as hands where I can for the least amount of culpability to our repair and restaurants for boys I 'm super kid ever let me do I wouldn 't be telling you what same thing under the act of the meeting now I 'm on you Sorry Sorry going oh hell busy right now so you follow in the formula that 's been used previously for other with rather lake and now there is there is no formula and there is no precedent as far as as far as a regional council and ourselves are concerned we are suitably using projects Bishop which is certain 545 and now push it with a 35 but the ratio of the power generators and ask should be 80 20 50 40 I don 't know what generators portion is not and the one here regional council supports at San on us well it probably a little bit I just use evidence core figures let 's say the job cost two hundred thousand dollars just say and just say after negotiations the council sheer was fifty thousand at 50,000 would be 55 us and 45 work out a regional council I really can 't take any further executives companies negotiations with the effect or I will release time when that 's been sitting stone and you came as counsel you guys gave okay CEO and come to Cocoa myself the delegation to negotiate sorry the question was does the power companies share come out of the webhead a regional council 45 or and then the separate terms busy separately so comes before it comes here as a pro just clarifying a comment you mania that we 're seeking at least cost solution to the right player isn 't right okay thanks definitely okay I 'm all would go on record as to say that I would I would truly wish that it would cost to repair nothing what 's happening curacao net we will set up the table and we will stay in the canoe to but I need to a degree so yep I 'm mindful that I don 't want to put unnecessary expenditures capital I for one and I 've been on record many times I 've sad again I personally I lately wilton high winds field operation can 't slacker is that meeting can we yeah you delegated it to coo coo coo okay so it 's not there will be the power generators the earth at some sausage rolls mighty little bit squashed so if there 's nothing more on that I think the answer that question it comes the Henderson raised about the lady Rosalyn forward and I sincerely hope something we 've done called any delays my know it off because we now have a resource consents from both teams to create our air like a region country so anything further on this some cheerleading auditor 's report is riverpoint insult or any other with where that leads off right comfortable if I was

word treatment i see i see it sitting at 26 488 907 at the moment I guess that 's step that top and be nice hopefully won 't be nuts probably out of context or neck wait let 's pay for my exponential year there 's Dennis Williams raised that one I see on their 2019 the tenders are significantly higher budget know the type important things to read about that because I 've always there I tried to push their prey annual plan submission and volition from TK and be probably their commitment yeah I agree he always come here crimes ten dollars today we get the Saints counseling for the he 's gone a lot of history and its own say that we would pursue pursue it through begin ok to write some sort workshop yeah I see it you 're I 've actually got our back from before one mistakes if we could add

    "text": "down to Aegina point number 15 which is departing from our investment policy and I think most of you know okay don 't demean hemet airplane for controlling or addresses please the 20 million dollar bond we have visited with the anz was previously rated a minus which is the minimum we could go to despair attire is your management policy the bank is offered to roll this temple investment that about two percent of the swap rate which is better than we can get in the marketplace at the neither stand on cause a traitor that trouble B+ which puts a slightly outside treasury management policy even though the angel bank itself is double a minus so we are seeking a resolution to approve the breach to say of the treasury management policy and respect to this investment so mr. van if we didn 't prove that what interest rate I see here you 're estimating to do with this weather beautifully 5.5 pretend to us yes so if we had to adhere to our investment policy what rate could you get for us how the problem with God corporate paper to invest entity so we probably have to lock it into adjustable bank to deposit and be pulling something so we 're probably looking at a four point five years opposed to 5pm yeah so when you tell you about I 'm pretty maybe 200,000 a year difference in any and I can we get out I just wanted to be in Cleveland yeah I 'm sorry for myself of them emotionally whether we cancel avison mm you just explain a bit more of the risk around they young the trouble or basically the ANZ is going to default or doesn 't evolve and I don 't think it can we 're the risk of the following over a bond placement of about eight hundred million because its reputation just goes straight out the window so as far as people are concerned it 's the ANZ this is just a funding tool within the anzio Treasury the Australian food so what do employers can wear diamonds here so is it just it 's just come off an indicator and Abby 's time period is enough you see was both had a bond five-year bond placement that has matured benzie has decided not to roll it they cashing it up in the market said she 'd be quite surprised at the ANC has decided for roller because in theory they can find it cheaper by other means so my angel question was or is and so okay just looked on the face of it I 'm surface make sense but how much was it invested poor because we 've come to the end of an investment return this is the was a five year nine point six 6 percentage so on 20 million and at the mic reporters we 've gone from that very cleverly structure my memory deafening earlier my tumors the mirror when you got that nine point six five years I thought there was actually aerobic at the time because the whole thing was going were there but here we are at that and this is the best we can do so comes will you had your henna I will obviously 200,000 as we 're thinking about but I just like a solution the actual risk you know as a robust thing it 's not it 's only of anything happen to the anc that subordinated bonds have been probably the top of the heap when it came to making making a goddamn and our creditors etc it 's correct and as far as the australasian panting steam is concerned you 'll kisses good as mine soap and I rather in the australasian banking scene and the European Becky since I 've sorry can 't answer hmm it 's like to move the resolution who are those people your poster on another question of women and so we do so a lot of people the public is saying reduce debt produce temperatures get me hear that all the time what are we paying for Eddie what I 'm to say it varies we currently up around the sex on average but some of our rollovers were getting a lot lower this is because of the swaps the interest rate swaps we 've got the covering up did because well is with my question is this prudent to reinvest asim names in bank on triple B or interest rate on that 's a quite a serious question for council because this is to your money and the questioners are you going to change the whole investment direction of the teal and and use it for debt reduction rather than investment because once you start using a pretend reduction your mazel psycho bottle it is it because you 're not going to raise 20 million and future by did to invest so once you start using your basement funds and of the te o to reduce bed you are saying we are doing away with the to your fund what would it be fair to say the advisors like in the future owner I 'm just ask you but coincides with the parts you 've been getting and the bank is telling you that over the next year they think interspatial right because that 's where I 've been told so not put into a duty well we 've got a ceiling on your cost of did I can go over a mover we have a mover cancel Henderson so nobody else without comment to my one question it 's a five-year role but depending on way that the market goes if there are some other investment opportunities we might insert on singly market at some stage that what 's saying if you know it was a reduction of rising rates to roll out for five years well we can 't_''_401.07 because the product is seldom is a five-year product of what we can do as I say is sell it on the scene free market and honor the other questions constant for te o fund the top atoms in difficult and raising careful a little bit non-core assets for God 's playing no I mean we 've always had the arbitrage but now we 're losing the magnificent mind when such go to 5.5 the good maybe that 's why most reasons honor well I think that is a annual plan issued because we would have to go up a consultation because changed and significant change in our treasury management policy so that was something that council needs to consider going forward a bear in mind those policies were set back in the days when when I getting mine and Tim 's team to turn now began a 5.5 center turn and we 're looking at borrowing interest rates may be going over but maybe it is prudent to be looking at financial policy at the moment cuz this water starts to balance the budget but doesn 't but yeah we 'll make me an HR Council on place so we don 't necessary get to work being your thing the treasury management policy sets investment strategy for the funds as to what the sentence range can be invested it and different products etc and a expected return and as I said we do have a ceiling on their interest rates on borrowing and we are with our standard of course rating actually raising funds cheaper than what we 're directly budgeted for many other the financials at our finance costs less budget and that 's showing through as a result of our standards rating so it is quite a significant decision to make to use tea or thumbs reduce lead I think mr. I think must be aware it 's just whispered to me make sense their Republicans said a media really interested in what you 've just eaten when you extrapolate this through if you just quite open and honest about it up to the program right words but we take 20 million 9.6 in real visitor at 5.5 you run about 800,000 minus of income Aniyah so you know we need to we need to really carefully look at this as best we can but if we want to move away from where you are here to where some of us are thinking it would cause what I would check it i wanna go tell you it is an important discussion to have no need to continue to have it which is why we have the treasury management report on the council agenda that we were to change the treasury management policy it would be an amendment to the plan so that could be a forward a new zealand involvement in a amendment to the long-term plan so that would be a process that we will need to enter and it 's not something we could do right at the moment it would probably but you know important to examine the treasury management reports each month to see how we going in the interim okay then I 'm sorry anywhere to that we have been expecting this slightly better than we thought would be and that has been has been taken into account in the 13-14 drafty and your plan which is ours from the marketplace it 's a matter for that slippage of interest or even I can cook well they are sound happy to see the cocoa bean counter him some of movement and Williams was taking the resolution that we approved and acceptance of people industry of the investment policy was respect to counterparty risk alliance commute until you told 20 million lines of the aliens in perpetual Horrible 's of workmen bombs mood champion some semi comes around or a favor say aye it 's cari item number 16 and development contributions review this is really just a discussion as to what is coming with William to us into the school vs sri is just bringing down box right here and it 's are available all right everybody good yeah in the fact that as part of the people in local government review the nominees for government one of the areas of the looking at is developing contributions so i 'll see should some of the changes go here that 's quite a significant wester counseled is one of their major funding sources and paper growth through kept on structure so cal fosters a fetus emotionally attached responsibility m.ed_,_693.66 neurotic really just going to reach those options and put some local context from terms of the top i district it 's not quite as bad as what the National governor pushing in terms of development contributions and I guess as a local council of how we deal with our developers we see was being pretty successful to this point so I really the resolution guys just so make you aware of and also get support communities in the Smashing of man like I think you could be very conscious of the fact i think it was our prime minister said he didn 't think cancel the developer contributions charged by councils were unfair too big but I let 's see the right pathway really need to pay attention to this one has it come down the draft boards I kept enzam here to say to their promised also commented a state and nation speech that councils are allowed to charge whatever they like get done with contributions which they 're not so I want just like in a point out that that was going to see yeah exactly and I also to point out to pick up on something here on page 16 power for an option three development contributions should repeat row across development and fostering discounting to shut this cost on the other developers or the community this is long and transparency area but let 's support there and I think it 's also out of alignment with that approach dependence on that paper so I 'm also have a space in this regard yeah I think I think this needs a lot of attention gainful will make the break the development of any count including us and how we paint one destruction so yep okay so it 's just it 's just a city as a resolution on the development contributions review special paper and so I asked for me replace we 've come to Johnson seem living in Council down a little favor I do I I carried again character agenda item number 17 you punch and you 've got this hailey I 've got a couple we broke up at the copper might not have properly it 's a peer review about the three water 's activity if you actually read it basically if you read it I would have to be the first to congratulate mr. with an ar-15 DSC because of peer review is basically a very good review are the street waters are in a very good place in the tablet or so yeah is that we receive the report that put the suggestive is division it but I would take time to comment Williams and her staff particular people have been at the coalface of it that I think that that amount of the problem is certainly received again good porque no just out of the Humane systems that man then the report was commissioned for two purposes really when the our operations as every so often you check on what you 're doing yes an independent assessment that you doing the right sorts of things so from an operational perspective I wanted external advice to just clarify that we were in the right space the second reason is that more globally more nationally local government generally has been a bit challenged from central government particularly infrastructure office with regards to the way performs its infrastructure of services and the three waters has been high government performs very bad in that resulted in a report for Treasury in about two thousand eleven suggested that both governments are quite poor in certain areas of their three water 's activity that report was produced by PricewaterhouseCoopers so I believe that for you fo for us as a group of cat owners as a team working together to employment PricewaterhouseCoopers to to give confirmation to the direction that you 've taken selected members because you took some key decisions during the long term plan process with regards water and I felt that it was prudent to get the rocks of pricewaterhousecoopers who 've been close look at what we do and give us elected members and defendable position for the decisions that you 've taken and the report quite clearly comes back and says the council has made good decisions in regard to its three water 's activity so that 's thumbs another reason office commission okay counter william swain of us does this this report assist you if you want benchmark for instance of the note was the regional initiative the work here at work you know will you be able to use this document for those purposes that you want them what cheer up Mason do three more whether you want to beeps Matt Cain through the challenges so a number of different work streams going on in the water 's area both nationally and locally or regionally and it 's interesting to note that many changes have been promoted in the water area but very little information is actually known about how local government performs in this area when sunken who are involved with one of the National reviews and forgive me I Cameron what the reviewers but I things like would land and water forum they were very keen to get their hands on this foot proof because it 's actually one of one of only a very few pieces of information that they can actually look to to give them robust analysis of the water activities for local governments are they we 've given them an advanced copy and the reason for putting it on the council agenda was so that PricewaterhouseCoopers could actually go back to Treasury with the report as a public document and and point out where type was doing well and give them more robust information about the local government sector tubes it will be used more ostensibly than locally I wonder if they might give us a bit of a consideration and necklace no doubt for small council chemical analysis I wish they wasn 't_''_1076.87 out of line with what I would normally do for auditing by my organization operations at times I would only do something like this every three to five years so it 's not out of line with what one would normally spend in that area so what would that but can 't the awesome I 'd like to move the resolution place and I don 't only do it I would actually like to secant it but in seeking the resolution i also want because it 's a recorded noted that i actually know that allah the governance decisions that were made at least three water 's actually came from the last train IAM and I don 't take giving away from some of those members it 's been a six year process 324 some government side of the street was so congratulations to all and evenly and in particular staff to carry it out so I 'm sick in that water flavor any against it being none Carrie thank you at you know item number 18 council delegations prefer council members the neck they rebounded by impregnating infrastructures was right to jointly and severally exercise of powers of counsel under this seems to me to be a very mechanical item but does anybody want to ask will take it or leave it or immediate this council down others moving it can safely and second of all as a favor I against chariots we now come to _"

merrill Foreman karapiro I was really interested to hear Peter McKinley I speak only the apt and a way forward but I 've government before making the way forward I took on board his comments that the lot of governments cannot ignore the changes indicated by central government and rather need to get on a horse and start riding hard otherwise I 'll be left behind the best be no benefit for this region I don 't think going for the desire benefit for councils to be anything hidden sand unless he his fear was at least a cooperator than following the egg then they would be maybe it may be given some thought was a really interesting address and I one thing I was you know it was pointed to say that but he 's already been formed and because of recent association worth I think he went on any of those committees and I know none of our castles or where else CEO meeting much is so I 'd like to think that we could eat on them Your Honor anytime you like I just want to say that that was a deliberate actions and you will find that the two extremes the district just the pragmatics of getting people together wasn 't that realistic so the bulk of the committee structure related and then at the Marin forum the agreement was that it would be the bulk of those counselors that would run the various projects just because it 's so hard to get people together and that 's why all the briefings are going through a full Meryl forum so that everybody can take part in those meetings but it was acknowledging the fact that because type 0 and x coromandel have that there are very extremes and they let me take you so long it was it was a discussion I have been involved in the working groups the gap governance and planning working group I 've been involved with with Kevin I 'm that was a Gavin 's request unless specifically the impulse I was happy to do that but it did mean four or five trips to know we 're here it 's quite a trip when you said take that out of your week actually can have quite an impact particularly when you going to rotor up and I think that politically the same discussions were have because type wood goes into different directions but those discussions were had and those offers were worth forthcoming imagine thousands aware as the capsule was in a way of the preceding any opportunity for us together tonight I don 't know why I like unless he wasn 't be equally

Simo I would probably like a workshop on this because this has could have a flow-on the freak with other things that we do and just you know where we stand with their germs it 'll all people don 't want to get rid of any of those that this kind of feels you know we need to the line and so I would like a workshop on on L sources that we support okay come to you some yeah great son did what makes those doctors to let emotions before us but I think it should be noted that this is exactly the type of thing regardless of whether one supports a little modern principle that under the changes that are being proposed through the Act will be potentially the Sullivans we cannot participate them I think it 's important that 's noted and the community knows and understands this because this effect is not just less activity but a whole suite of activities which we do can I ask you a no question please what in the wrong business Jackson your position council would this proposal survive this and I think one of our problems is that there 's no definition around what our local services as this a-league local see my show so all is leveled local government act performance being pulled apart last couple bill piece of paper why yes no matter couldn 't you couldn 't give me a yes no whether it would survive on strip your instruction manual is it good for household Jen business okay let 's finish on moon has been no case law and as using tens of other local service I hope you grab the fish council to prove case law because it 'll cost us so what do you want to be alive girl suggesting to defer this day would you support that as a team to what everybody else becoming completely but in there honey gets a month for the staff and parents well what is it the intention of you counselors here that have mistakes were to come back at the April meeting and say yes you 've got your off to funding then we would continue is that out is that we 're at all this was a I 'd like a workshop in between now on the April meeting another month just to go over you know the local government perform on somebody else will do it anyway support capsular downloads wish reasons one will work shopper shouldn 't matter if not only just us something aww lil well your annual plan is some precious in my there closer look that 's y mx don 't toss it yeah that would be sort of sailing living in that way be all that we do for high for then we do comply to that be otherwise when we change the only thing turns that sound or cancer Johnson I 'm sorry miss change culture Johnson f sure the options 4.3 when you have the words ensure that the spray even would satisfy that we 're not using web around to subsidize other people surely that would be the beach bar going forward there 's a potential profit but that 's break even with the Oscar funding which we don 't know but God or not God but they are helping the decision if we 've worked off that option three what the funding would satisfy the requirement that in then I 'm sorry just answer them I could go I think because weather breaks April it 's probably all the cases about it activity the question I was going to ask is as I understand it as the store already in the long term plan really contain numbers and I think from memory the discussion around McGovern report was generally of the opinion the legal versus I 've heard that if it 's already in your plan it 's unlikely to be challenged going forward is it that 's great and it 's one of the points that I made provided you violent and avoid you 've got the funding if the funding pours over it period okay come together in caretaker yeah but I back to us come cancel Johnson that he 's he 's comfortable with funding body if it is if it is seated a commercial rate that he 's come towards Council BAM business was competing with other local businessman sangai which supplied about the bomb forwarding the others fully occupied so you 're saying we should be an anything you know yeah but I don 't throw from accessing activity justifies us speaking the managers your plan and I think that 's where this council wants to be the levels of service were providing on what activities we 're involved rooms regard for the new local government they 'd really just start addressing these issues not rather than just leaving them to be another long term plan I don 't that 's very proactive and i 'll also i would also to find it quite a station full of fun after the council was making decisions just because they didn 't have the commercial maritime leading up to an election I think yeah and I tangled what sort of things you say most gyms and all these sort of things but I think it really seems about that accounts of a downer has asked for a workshop on it and we deferred to April because there 's the issue of repeating myself of the funding it 's a totally different clean field if we haven 't got their funding which we will need to address now over just like that you support that we can 't extrapolate that council dance workshop them to all on some view because that your ltd proteus and this is this acceptable together if we could allow an hour or something for decision then we will be fully armed and better to serve the district money until you make approaches at the apt my cousin and I just done may call me back to councillor wouldn 't all quite offended that you make a comment like that at no time any issue that comes in front of me but I think of election or anything I do it June process and with infamy make a decision so I 'm quite offended by that comment what I would just like to respond to that town castle and Donna was regards to the proposal for that Porter finance naught of committee we have our counselor could see the talent the sled that this only six months to go and let 's leave it to the next rhenium and I think there 's only a three a three-year training and six months doesn 't just keep this counter so it 's nice it 's quite a large chunk out of three years ago we come to keep my here to defend itself judge enough on that 'm the oddball because I 'd like to support this at least for 12 months or for another term probably with the effect of saying it perhaps doesn 't or does fit in with the new local government like so at least we give notice particularly to and to the families that use this facility one of the letters do this refer to the favorite she 'll find it very difficult to to find alternatives it is a service it 's been raining for a few years now and I also support a workshop to try and find whether we should be continuous but I mean providing we get the Oscar funding shrine in running late for another period with the effective of proper notification to the Croaker 's I I think the council is signaling these council members here are signaling and tell me if I 've got it wrong that provided we have a workshop and provided we get the Oscars funding we will be looking very favorably favourably added at the April meeting is that word that we 've got a general consensus on that real well south side right we have a workshop I 'll defer this to April and we will have an Oscar funding in place every workshop to get our own heads a bit more around because quite honestly these letters here this morning will it be chairing the meeting I haven 't had a chance to remodel and because they were handed out Tim that 's fine so that 's what we 're doing to our he won 't defend the item and please protect organize the workshop the commons i was one of our other workshop so can we move _"

of think you want to it 's just basically switch cleaned that it spends two areas of resume and kinds of on site provides for nexus on to cram road to what 's known as tapos district councils depot site and it 's primarily mechanical to notice in the paper to see what kind of think that we can in relation to create met and through to the relevant parties can reserve your boat and essentially switched off well I see you in the room I 'm gonna users with the devil 's advocate now this basically been on a market for some time frames ok now we 're more prospective purchasers look at it didn 't have access on to power I did it this proposed that this go three expect this gives it access on the ground at a dozen three so pleasing another creature on the web apps because it 's on the the counselor if we get shipped at us item two computers utakata coach hand in glove as OJ 's substance it but stop the answers going on us man and yes and no and we believe from previous potential purchasers that this would assist in Salem it to anybody at least one of the other potential purchases that was a major sticking point then was the lack of so they never came forward with an officer with in second in further exactly because it didn 't have access but if we do this today it gives it access so my point is if we do this and we give this piece of an active are we going to re retake it back to the matter what what I think it should be shut up yeah this one 's actually give you the access he puts enough for public consultation to start the process luckily I 'm so we start 22 and Republic don 't say anything it then gives it access yes there you want to take we internal mouth along till tomorrow to properties and some people are through around access onto pram road which is a major arterial route another your anything wrong yet and I think it I check it in prisons attorney only one that 's very common as I can i seduce know that this is the decision or the concern that you might have is related to the item that is contradiction rather than specifically to this particular part of it so as you 're talking about in terms of value and it might be something so you 'll be clear gonna say if we pass this now and i 'm in favor of it that my fellow colleagues will take this into account when we discuss another item in confidence okay cool i think is going to give this piece of the big block of n that means freeing up it needs access on firmer it didn 't have it won 't ever until we 're finished as proceeds but with no anxiety about psychotic just the actual width of the entrance they 're so tiny high speed measurements oh no visitor is it just one lane access or is it now it is only 20 meters yeah yeah sorry that it made it an even split in some flexibility in a recent rather than specifically defining an access point of designing tomatoes employment stability local requirement the flexibility was given for that the patrols under the district plan we manage what would be the type of access both of the vehicle access the prospect but what what comes our technical question counsel explains question is this is very very small as all good what is that let 's figure in really has a destination such 20 meters thank you 20 meters and effect was freed up that allows egress and intrigue to that point where everybody each other so the resolution that states the animal committing it will be used to say in April committee or do you want to miss em together a computation probably the year sensational be around same time so it seems to be the same busy the both of them that 's what I 'm asking before I calves are you happy to use it 's a miracle committee or to somebody else won 't be on to live with the reserve situation again or your problem that 's right off this one just don 't know amorphouse wonderful person I think that 's fine yep I think that 's ok as capital in fact we 'll be looking at the content obviously so just to confirm this comes with william johnson okay and they have to leave a shrink that dynamic or any situation if it was on the wagon or paranormal sec ago it would do what we do as cases serves to according the seniors it going out who i want person can be civil are you sure you don 't have a reserve move move comes without a second place comes the filter or the paper I do you know why the number 11 offer to purchase 15 10 warmer place spectacular thank you and yeah everything is taking forever detail we 've received an offer and subject to the object as far the auction process for 575 and basically wouldn 't need to counseling for young on a budget does the protector pregame the cadre council majority of initiative justice PSD commentating it 's a residential property so the pictures whom the critical for immediate evac if they use it for a commercial usage I think tonight they 're using it for residential for their own residence it 's my understanding because I over will release goes to say you know he 's only you bring pictures including the exclusive or as little people ask the pigeon by flashes are right if somebody is buying it for a commercial purpose being made entitled to claim GST back if not not do we have to pay me though even question so the 575 we send up the GST content away is the price of you vile invisible qualities what 's your nasty numbers a low resolution and since I said closer logistics so do we physically when we receive the money send away whatever fifteen percent of GST back doing you cancer history so the neighbors up to counselors in the fourth something it 's like we claim the GST when we cleanse us delete this if it was a suggestive resolution on page 11 mar 3 it does no further questions if to Johnson or as a favor hi right ok moving on the side of you is so probably actually motifs motion about it seems very clips or your dash for me when I got couch a true and I have to till I get cancer Johnson I chose no fear the community public letter yes y 'all back up once again so in relation to this property purchases second part of Galvan Rosa counselor had serious concerns we 've got bad statement so I wish to abstain converting on this and I wish to outline were reasons why this one was only discussed this now last time the confidence what is counsel it was not Magena by to discuss the problems same thing is has been clearly a breach of confidence and regards to the sale of this property and I believe that potentially produces the purchaser and also purchases council potentially in terms of its future negotiations with regards to this property and potentially other properties prices so basically my issues around transparency and natural justice and I 'll be abstaining quidditch it and i think i forgot to them say on I hope that 's mounted in detail place and I wish to stand for those reasons your switches should be in our position they 've got to warms what 's wrong okay Calvin comes with him I 'm total contrary I totally endorse the sum I 'm very very heavy to vote for this resolution and I think God above for allowing us to if I was the 16th I would have seen or muscle seed make sure those I would have seen get lost tough I district council mr. Stan 's following an option are put on offer and good faith to the council now this council agreed to sell the land X evaluation provided by a beach Morrison a ever value up to ten percent less than that valuation that was that was discussed as an item of conference at the fabric the february meetin and subsequent to that we 've had a total breach of confidence with had a total betrayal of trust because I 'm a sustained has been his head has offer put out there in the public domain which was which in other words of he had have walked away we 'd be lived with some opposition his birth nor are we compromised in evaluations known to the market what we did here was an agreement between this council to go out to seek another valuation because there was some criticism of the valuation that we should get an out of town valuation and we did that in the meantime there was a public criticism of this professional local valuation to be of each morrison and the Dominion Post there was a total breach of confidence by somebody who leaked those two crosses to the Dominion Post this is this is absolutely I needs the code of conduct and what we 've done as a councillors we have laid ourselves open toe claim both by the potential future so that we 've also undermine the integrity of council because we have violated of what was a range minh trade of good faith so I 'd like to ask our CEO to to read a letter that was sent home today by the pooch sir because I think was a very serious regards to chase it so and I think that we need to take it very seriously and actually instructor CEO to have a review done of violation of the breach of the code no and I 'm just like Rob to advisors on that place Oh I 've seen the letter that counselor William this is referring to some computers my advice to the council is that that letter requests will requires the chief executive office of the start a process and my advice to the council does that litter were now table before this council in public that process will be severely compromised what we 've got do is let the CEO take another crisis don 't swim and I 'm I 'm sort of at odds or that mr. Gold 's free because the person who wrote that letter wanted to present the ecclesia here and analyst come to this council so I don 't see how how that parties starts would be compromised the problem the problem is that the letter requires an investigation by the chief executive and it 's obviously not only the person who justice purposes but any other person and that would be publishing Oh mr. Godsey you suggesting that we as a council shall be protecting a person who has breached the confident has a hazard header grade betrayal of trust by this council and breached a confidential item and leaked it to the media all I 'm saying is that the letter request the chief executive to start process and if that letter was tabled today in that process group is at risk of compromise not only respect of the person who 's asked for it to be processed but also especially in person it oppresses I 'm sorry I 'm not with you because the person who asked for it to be posted once that happen that habit domain an assassin because I can I take them to a slightly different context then as I say all I can do is give advice and the consequence able to do in a situation where a complaint is made for instance somebody was complaining about me if that complaint was dealt with in the public and I could challenged that process for that 's the rest such as much about a person who is containing is about a person who might be looking about here okay comes Anderson I will switch my bike on this time my apologies to those people out there in rieber couldn 't hear me or others in relation to this just to clarify position I intend upstate not because I necessarily disagree with the motion for us but by describing the process that 's been fired I mean the second thing I wish to also be about a rebel that the counselors the best of my knowledge and Sydney myself have yet to view a copy of the Sidley adept and confidence location is a beauteous when Celtic ever heard quite a bit about breaches of confidence and so on in the past thing today especially I just have a question about this breach does this an accusation of the breach by a governance member by councilmember or boy I start me forever perhaps I can I 'm being deliberately obtuse because anything and the counselors will see the leader in confidence obviously but if there 's the investigation to be successfully carried out by the chief executive officer the details of the complaint and who what might be complaining about currently me to be made public pool he 's having a chance to do the investigation I think that 's fecal it so I think this is being labeled on enough so that it swims a good grip so that 's my bus to you well we doing for you to give advice so I guess like all consultants we should take him so nothing for them walk so I just like to finish off by saying that I 'm unashamed actually two sets up on a console where this is a breach but there 's been a contender continuous breaches of of this type and I feel that you know it 's just simply not good enough enough it was council needs to actually take some immediate action to Mexican converts the public that actually does his credibility and ninety percent well I think the investigation should have them because us from the public option where they attended raised their hands and central cetera did they 're pretty run comes with a blend I 've got nothing to hide with it I accept my attainable getting another valuation which the decision we made so I would welcome at be investigated properly because I think I think we just should do the job properly so come to use them to some apply to counsel keeper nobody in particular is being accused of anything but clearly there has been a bridge and because that information is out there what my concerns more the factors but no response the country this is happened and we 've waited for something to happen from the public rather than taking responsibility for this ourselves Cleveland there 's counsel and furthermore we have not been briefed at all on this panel okay that 's not a matter of moving out agenda number hyper aight another fitting joint management agreement will also tell you later okay accountability documents received from councils or CTO culture control organizations there 's no significant decision required it 's a matter of receiving them you 've got all the attachments from tampa airport authority laughs but you 've local authority shared services we 've gone 42 f you know local government funding agency six-month 04 you have those and a secret so does anybody want to comment or ask any questions pertaining to them ok so the suggested resolution is at page of a top of page of 1201 comes receive the six monthly reports etc the council receive the draft statement of a team of the Youth Authority local shared services a and B bishop services and local government funding agency so if there is no friction Bureau or last

make JMA with te arawa because I want consistency and i also want to be involved broke our and I 've so from our point of view as a council because you can 't consistency because basically those jae mazor seek to achieve the same of kept us they just was took the parties one thing I don 't want to say the wrong thing but variant minders election coming up and some people have to clearly not standing does that should that affect the appointments going to pull that honey bear six month well I are you my case so I think what their wives of one of those people who has just gone on rock out what would like to to stand in for me for Tierra where some consistencies so usually what is it one of the you you go off to recover and to have any era one and we 're at all what is going to be sorry mr. chairman it 's going to be too fancy because that 's lemon today though you know another controller I take my tanker my take on good and I 'm going to come to you captain food how did I get it one do you want someone to replace you yeah and there is consistency and going forward into the next rain here Matt what they put my question Thomas traitors can actually be done here today so does not get your pocket I could take it on board but I have to address it in a different way and on top of that i 'm also i 'm also suggesting that and the appointment for rock hourly you know we have consistency i would recommend that the same people I can come over if you take an old war but we come to you about today is that I 've got a quintal mom can 't do anything about the taro taro our committee and miss you know but bear in mind that was when castor beans has boarded up can it be at the next agenda I 'm going to agenda that soo Jin 's oh yeah yeah sesa recommendation Norwegian me I believed didn 't_''_1544.63 we need to reform it all at some point potentially depends on the negotiations with Chico a car in Tarot in terms of boundaries it might be no that 's not that movie 's not required okay just secondly must to endorse podcasts or what it was a saying about you know getting my mother 's right in that regard it 's going to be a later who 's on each committee and also a skill set eh in 10 days and that goes for not just this committee goes for all council appointments to keep okay all we can do is doubt that so here 's one resolution number one device and important valve resolutions that it would come to Truman Johnson heckling viana to the joint committee appointed counsel heckling at the coach in business and Chancellor Truman as a deputy coaching business so

    "text": "please us improvements to the cafe equal terms now we workshop us as you might remember with what your Regional Council I saw what the labor on the table where I would love that adverse resolution that the CEO or delegated start on an attempt to bring the control and the reign of the trust to protect each other rather than white head of regional council I simply cannot I lose the battle that 's fine or I 'll put it on the table i cannot i just cannot it 's not powerful for me to have a bus services paid two hundred thousand dollars by the right path approximately and two hundred thousand dollars by NZTA be controlled by work at a regional council i just think we should be masters of our own destiny and money remember service but i just put there on the tables I did once before I don 't think it meant that much flavor what do it e councilman well I 'm hundred sent an agreement here if you worship I think that we should be masters of our own destiny and it Hilton 's connect connect a huge feast in two thousand I believe us four thousand dollars a month we pay to work the original council to run our bus service for me just interrupting a little bit I 've asked mr. Williams how does this happen on how does it happen way kind of reasonable country has the power to delegate the running of the bus back to us if they so wish but they don 't seem to wish to delegate us the power to run our own must ever but I say that we should add something just resolution on put some heat on it that way good just to continue I think that the marketing of it 's been really poor and I also that they haven 't that the customer survey has been 20 yelling and I think that there really are not always providing are the routes that are the most needed and so therefore that there 's a disconnect between what committee needs and what 's been provided and therefore i think and i think really they look at the local and I 'm the description below il-1 I made it quite clear in the workshop that I disagreed with the added options I don 't think that el bus service she 'll be picking up school kids and interest to make up numbers to eventually bring the ratio that the NZTA want off the outsides my feeling is is that it was always our elderly and people that don 't have transport in our community so yeah to justify to bring up the numbers and these extended ribs on on games now the news reporter we had been worded number three here that ticket gotta be instructed to attempt to bring the whatever the weather food management of the NZTA local government funded bus service back in half an hour something which like that do I support letters or going on what sorry lungs timenado I 've come cancel because obviously he 's on our transport because he lands on that series TMO comes legends budget no I 'm just like my client regarding probably it is a requirement that the patronage is got be uplifted there 's no question about that and some of the school children and some of the tourists in time we the bus service is not viable but you know that 's full stop so you know we 've got to be mindful that the the patronage has some way has got to increase I think again I 'd like to see an investigation into the trucks bringing it back into turbo for the management definitely but it 's it 's but this not begin to think kids given that all the tourists view of us for that Medicare say I think the toothache is the fact that government used to supply buses to get kids to school and all that sort of thing and they 're like oh so we 're reaching another steak and i 'm happy about them or what I 'm not happy about is for people driving from MSM us paying four thousand dollars a month full year old grand a year to have our first tip is bonkers when I believe people like that very able a in the back right here could be doing it I go to run through and 18 or 20 seasons or at the foil off the ground wheelchairs can get them bikes go on the front and then I sit up work and Myra street on a sunday catch up so where do I see a 40 seen a bath lumbering part but nobody or another water we do you want to go my Sunday so I do think that came to run around us who you worship you know that is up to us we did a review off of the bus routes it was it 's our responsibility to develop you the first rooms we did that at the workshop like a role all of us I would we have a majority support for a member state of resolution here to stop the CEO to tend to get positives Beckham you said you are talking I just wondered with a clear with mud comment on any of these points that have been raised as to Shh thank you I I have to tend to agree was with worship some some of the decisions made by Hamilton Waikato Regional Council have been a bit disconnected the contract so really we 're just to go between in it why power bus companies bus operator so some of the decisions that have been made I have to question I haven 't_''_385.75 been totally listen to and unfortunately some of the route changes are not really where our clients want to trim like nuclear hell came out tops but it hasn 't even been included up the hole so it would be good to actually have a little bit more control and say so decision making in the natural process well I had Somerset village build up my office October councils as nine months ago and thought thought that we were just idiots they thought that we were running the buses because the bus used to go into summer set out from tell this story across incoming traffic going in pick them up take them to way to New it and bring her back in town they couldn 't understand where they couldn 't be picked up on the way back from what to do with Ben terber and I it took me six months of Aegon 's I think that 's diabolical that could be just changed by bringing you down in your office oh thank you for supporting that third part of the resolution kind of a move therefore doin you for those inputs of wintermint yes I 've got the co-instructor to investigate bringing the management potato commuter services council become a member for evidence on this culture Johnson cigarettes captain morgan favor i carry on join cali worship I just like to also that space total satisfaction was that presentation we were nearly enough information was regards to their the passenger surveys and when when the consultant was questioned he doesn 't he didn 't have have the information to you know to convey didn 't see any of the right information from doing so what I 'm saying is that I was difficult to make those two decisions and cut on the city 's resolutions because well the the decision about the change rate if I still don 't feel that we had enough about the dynamics of Israeli profile of passengers for age they were what numbers were involved was a whole a minister SI x our world of all translates onto the roof of myself for the money they 're in this new environment of creating efficiencies are meeting together in the greater weight energy to which we made all that doing it today or we had to conclude the fool people driving down from hamilton to run our bus service apologies for the one could add that to us be vicious _"

    "text": "modem uh then send a painting of the roof and other remedial work to our beautiful ac large complex and event center mr modern welcome sir thank you fabric the report is as read in a nutshell the proposal is to bring the roofing of the event center to a similar standard as we are currently doing for the external structural steel wood to bring it so that the whole building looks like new on the outside we 're proposing to use funds that have already been approved by council as a contingency item there 's a contingency for the structural steel work painting and we have gone out for prices for two reputable contractors one being the existing tbs farmsworth and holmac as well who knows well and we know them and hallmark is coming as the better tender and we 've allowed for a small contingency because some in case we needed to see them work the building was built as you probably all know in 1998 so it 's approximately 50 years old the warranty that was on the route sheeting has now expired we 've had cheating there and that 's brittle and over the next few years is likely to break down even further than it has now so um it 's time for an upgrade and that 's what i 'm proposing so are you going to paint over the translucent sheets no we 're going to replace them we 're going to patch them up yes probably not what we organized originally i know we made the sub committee of council cracking williams and heckling um for the ac bars conflict have they been involved in this process before no no but uh i think one of the outside meetings the worship if i might just talk to that uh we did comment to andrew that whilst we was getting the steel frameworks done the rest of the building should be painted and i think that was sort of the outcome of this today because i mean why do one and not the other just it is what it is so if it 's a budgeted journal i 'd just like to congratulate andrew and whatever contract is coming under and this we um well done and i 'd like to move it well and council just for you did you have your hand up before comfortable limbs name i thought no i was um not in my head but where 's the castle i have a question just on um uh occupational health and safety issues when these tenders are received is there any auditing or anything like that done on these things that are having regard to the new standards and the changes that are occurring in the building industry for example do they have to fully scaffold around the around the roofing area to undergo a painting project like this parts of it will be councillor but most of the work on the roof will not and we are familiar with the new department of labor working at heights requirements we 've been council staff have been in small workshops with the representatives of the ministry of building to discuss those they 're very hot on those and all the projects that we start we demand that the contractors advise the department of labor of when the work starts and site to inspect and check on whether safe working practice is being carried out well that 's good because this could otherwise turn into your thirty one thousand dollars um unforeseen work allowance being eaten up if you didn 't look at that no we do we are cognizant surely our contractors must meet the lost regulations and standards in the industry yes and they are uh the contractors we use are approved contractors yeah i think that 's in the story put a full stop in there that they 're regulated that 's the regulations that is what it is yes oh you worship if if any one of us has been by the ac baths and seen the work to do with the columns that were painted they were all scaffolded they were strapped struck and dropped and yeah okay enough please come to himself yeah just to add to what council down i was saying i think it 's just sorry i can turn that off um just to what council down i was saying i think it 's worth noting that this project has been managed and budget and that 's both you know credit to the councils have been monitoring the project and people who have been working on it um um did stand up with you and some other counselors and and look and the roofing is is very shabby um as you pointed out here the translated fireplace is breaking down and brittle but i think um it has to be noted by councillors that because there hasn 't been a regular maintenance program on this roof that that moss and fung and mold has built up and undermined undermine the surface so i understand from mr bowden that that this will come from henceforth there will be a rigorous maintenance program to ensure that this building stays in pristine condition for as long as possible there has been some maintenance on the roof the roof has been washed probably about five years ago but the liking builds up over time especially in the environment that we 're in within temple we found some liking on the roof of the ac rats so there has been some maintenance but once we have the for the painting there will be a regime of maintenance that 's required to make sure that we don 't have to paint it every year to be honest with you so details of that will be issued by the contractor and we 'll need to stick to those to maintain those warranties okay we 'll make sure your doctor 's trained to have it entered in our maintenance matrix as simple as that as simple as mining the lawns on reserves we have a matrix we 're going to do it so that 's cool anything further there being nothing i won 't read the whole resolution out you 've obviously read it on page seven by four i will ask will i move the please can 't tell them sorry mike 's already moved this uh this item here i 'm sure is very very dear to councillor kate 's heart i 'm sure that he was here with us today he 'd be jumping up there and go along and move it widening for hippy road uh you 've been given a map here we only have areas that this will hand out are showing you is what is proposed in the whitening process love to widen the whole street as we 've said for reasons you obviously know why so um really it 's uh we 've got anybody to talk to it or i think we 're just going to i 'll throw it up in here and see your hands there 's there well tiger 's red it 's not going to solve all the cycling issues and what he wrote but it 's also addressing drainage improvements pavement repairs guard railing and some other smaller to work so it 's not solely about wiping it for cycling purposes so even though it 's 89 dollars more than 9000 councillor crate is doing a stirling job of trying to change driver attitude towards cyclists and number two the widening of the roads but i think you know he 's been in the press recently advocating for a high status with nzta with regards to this road here that um it 's actually linking two state highways and my question is that you know can his drive to achieve this i mean i know this is where we 're going to do this here which is a a small step but is there anything cut where 's council can do to advocate well i think williams wants to speak but um i know the process has already started it is a process bureaucratic process uh but that process i believe has started mr williams yeah well i 've got a member of staff karen balasoglo who 's helping councillor craig put together a document to look at the incidents of advocating for a state highway one of the one of the cautions i would throw into the room at the moment is be careful what you wish for because sometimes with state highways like that if they become a state highway they actually rank lower on the state highway network and therefore attract less funding so it might actually be a perverse outcome that we don 't want as a community but that 's what i 've got karen working with dennis and claire and the team uh with to put a doc a comprehensive develop a strategy on what would be good what would be the best outcome for having around for our community but having said that much of them don 't stay the high wage where accidents are recorded in that move up very high up on the list that accident areas normally go to the top of this that 's the theory but when you throw them in with all new zealand state highway network um it can actually have an outcome that you weren 't expecting so that 's why i 'm urging caution in terms of that final outcome but we 're putting together a comprehensive report um to advise you uh as to what the the best course of action for the community would be well i think all of us on earth are pretty pleased to be accepting this tendencies to as we often talk about eating an elephant to at least start somewhere so uh let 's get this part started so do i i 'm sorry do i ask for a movement of

take items rather just this we 're trapped then approached by buy toprol around providing some information for cyclists in the kindle domain that 's the main starting point of the w2k track from the kid market and amount of usage on is huge the guts of this report is really the size and nature of this build is such that both by tap on herself on some form of security on tenure particularly from council perspective in terms of not having any liability I guess for what is quite a substantial structure and from by toe boards perspective to have some security for News News outside and other sins are laid out all the reserve planning aspect of it is quite a straight up first quite straightforward item but I 'm taking questions of their own I can 't think of it a rib there any questions but not the river we were cleared hoc committee okay completely yeah John is just the area that is proposed aside I thought majority of that was first boat trailer park I know it 's the boat trailer park and goes tends to get would be China pushing further into the domain so we 've where the Gobi blocks on the moments which is where the main boat parking now people do partner boats that yeah i rightly or wrongly part of the boats further and further within the domain okay it fits with the management under fers we try to make sure that the bogles didn 't encourage too far on that way at the time when we did that management does it fit well Allison thorough report is not raising the issue so I bow to a person 's knowledge on us but it was fit really tie these up that site primarily as well the management 's doing no for dinner I spoke to the design join us anyway that we see I you know got six here that X years it isn 't God the know quite a nice design der Linden point they you 've seen the year here I don 't quite a fight the bucket on a lot of psychology now quantity of a 3d turn shields mr. the night so you decide what the signs on the site you know you need some quite nice designs that have believed in the Mormon a man theme of cycling as well you know the mountain boy it 's just hard to see the other it 's a steel framing temper clothing obvious i mean it 's fairly sort of run-of-the-mill stuff but i presume the boards and the like the put it inside will try and will provide a theme with us more often well I Stephen Nathan Ford 's and you know tumor and stuff like that into the theme of the book shows so no we could make it quite a feature or you know I don 't know whether what toples all about their as though you know rather than a structure neck it 's got information you know that we could go down so what your boy off to so this is the look and feel of it you want you know the joint in I mean it 's the actual mountain biking going through and see now seem rather than just a ship yeah you know just an actual theme Connor rights you know made with native wood or something like that well what i can do is when i 'll feed their butts up what if we can get some office impressions on flipping through volume up yes exhibition and perhaps there are concerns medication approaches may be using some native tongue or something but should you not have a more clear as sort of a picture of what the finished results of the people that have like reading concerns about especially anyone clips opposed to it or something like that can actually see it finished article maybe they 'll take the 1003 how you know I kind of natural that the other than just a pretty sent us a picture year and I think comes down as I Drive to the public reserve and I 'm a especially a place like a locket should without being too that I caught costs ridiculous the other thing some medical bills and things like that being on BTS should be full of petabytes the grid here okay so another council voting to say there 's a door committee that has to be appointed to hear submission if they 're already so do I have any nomination suggestions or volunteers for a lot of a better word which we get on that comes down well it 's a selena counselor trait only our zombies the operation that you know I quite proved oh come on there we will have that we change the reservation to eighty three or four and we 'll put four names down here which one will become two crates and then when it is time if I don 't mind being drawn so we had comfortable into account down over we had cancer or run Johnson or any others and come to the crate so three of those four to be to form the ad hoc committee because if counsel approach their desires at the time to do it do for have to sort out who your three out okay I was thinking to make them super to do to move it a reserve so the three councils and reserve divided at money received via the gasifier or material bondage we predict i 'll just leave at the horn enjoy that time because when is it likely to be with what time frame you looking at we 're probably looking within six weeks at say pinterest i 'll probably nothing has a really nice mobility formalism info johnson as a reserve okay so if your medical that move comes in second become for Truman all over over I you know item number 63 said over for me surrounding why it 's here we have the least old hand back over to mr. real again I think basically really we could take it as read most of us around the table know why this agenda item on the agenda as the seat so do we have any questions or any counsel before I ask because a mover or similar to the resolution free I would like to note also though that sadly I do think this should come to us by to any community board in the interest of time I am the offer that the administrators of the estate have got they did sir conveyed that and on and on their behalf and I apologize the 2-inch making water for that I 'm torturing community forward support just basically so apology to the board and Gary usual commendable yes Africa I 'd like just to simply say that is part of the article that says board members board members have come to me and said that they did not receive the information and on that basis perhaps I can suggest that we use the in the house email system so that I do become informed and in this occasion the board 's decision would have been painful of the reservations they have a problem mr. responsibility sudden what happened i emailed all north of all members tried so done I would name the thing they didn 't get email some of them are hopeful we need to check out you know maybe we should be figured out that receive requirements of it in the future so if we don 't get a receipt from the recipient we can find it maybe we take their chances from the top Aquino Adams vertically apologize to the terrain community board it 's happened this way but to Expedia think I think Tom it is what it is I asking about anybody else has any questions on the suggested resolution and poverty 20 release of the microwave remote again typical the North recent seat at the guy again I thought you on the basis that this would be a good outcome in terms of that this securing the future of the cabin area so i move the resolution on 630 thank you have a movement for the resolution and my of a second ago I think when cancer down so all those in favor I 'm mainly so move thank you very much for us to it and now calling on the _"

    "text": "too much presentation from egl female an infra-red leg cover unless you we have four top and food delivery should be a very lady before general sorry about that thanks very much Chevron and good afternoon my name is supiera and i 'm chairman fat Trel 804 so my pleasure to pick them off this afternoon for enterprise great lake toefl with thanks it 's thanks to everybody in this room who have been accessible action-oriented and dedicated to the region France and I talk a lot 12 economic development colleagues around the country and with my hand on my heart I can tell you one of the most supportive councils in New Zealand and it really does make a huge difference so thank you very much everybody I also wanted to talk very briefly about some of the challenges that we do face in this region before handing over to fret because the work we do in economic development is actually quite hard when it can everybody fans across the entire country so sometimes it 's actually I think it relevant to talk about some the challenges we face just very briefly and I think one of the things I 've just thanked you for is strength of the governance relationship between the boredom enterprise-grade late oh poor and council and I know I can pick up the phone and speak with any of you and have on many occasions called Rick and Cedric and I have five minutes of your time always available always accessible and that made a huge difference to the to the effectiveness of what we do with in enterprise great lake tow port I think there are areas though where we can we can improve our governance relationships and specifically when I look at how incredibly well the harvest working at an operational level walk in there and it 's all gone and it 's fantastic to see that but all those boards that support all that operational activity I think we need to get together more we need to be talking more I think potentially there 's some work to be done around how we sit as a smaller region within the larger region so how do we relate for example to Waikato an organization and possibly as a region need to work a little bit harder in that area and I guess the other key governance relationship which we we work hard at and I think we gain some traction but the study speak more work done is with eat we in the region they do and sixty percent of the land and they have a lot of capital at their disposal at the moment and have a lot of appetite for economic development so for us i 'm potentially also for you I think we need to work hard in that area the next challenge and there 's really this is just a point this out provincial New Zealand is at best in a static situation and at worst in decline there is an increasing level of urbanization globally and New Zealand is no different from anywhere else so just to even maintain our economy here you know that takes an enormous amount of work because we are going against the tide currently and I think to to reverse that requires really innovative thinking and real dedication to the task and because I know you get that but we are against the tyrant moment and the last challenge is this is definitely a challenge opportunity and you know thank goodness for the cows is all i can say because cows are keeping this economy afloat regionally and nationally but we see in a drought however we are so you know I don 't know what the latest figures are but we will have lost hundreds of millions in this region and certainly possibly billions across New Zealand because of the drought so we must diversify there just is no other answer and again we need to be thinking innovatively and we need to be thinking creatively and we need to be working hard we need to support our primary producers there what we build our economy on but we also need to be thinking what else can we be doing this region and with that I 'll hand over to Fritz who 's going to tell you what else we 're going to do thank you sooo steam councillors you worship the mayor this presentation today is going to be quite seen before for me like in the past we 've concentrated I guess a lot on on strategy and where we 're in a goal and and all the things we promised we would do so this time I 'm pretty much going to talk about things we actually have directional items and things that we are going to do so kicking things off we had a reshuffle or not a reshuffle but we 've also increased our team slightly we 've now a welcome frame Jenkins to our team and what that means friends going to take on all these some support team thinks I 'll the past between and myself we actually ran the accounting side we ran the website we still bill the minutes and did all the trustee things so all these sort of mention with support things were all got a frame now so it 's she 's a real dynamite she loves ticking the boxes and she 's got us a little bit frightened actually getting it all in order she 's a highly efficient and very very scary and and it 's going business support she 's Excel than that she I 'm going to talk to about that in a minute of it more especially in relation to monarchy know and to running but she 's going to be a lot 12 fri we freed up a lot of the Edmund time from here and she 's going to have a lot more time there which then frees me up to take a lot more time into the into the bigger projects which which we really really want to get involved in just a bigger level and we 've got a report on that as well so what have we done and what I near the connection points sorry myself y 'all missed myself but you not me so I don 't need to talk about myself oh sorry next one so where we were this is this is a Michael the mushroom this used to be our building and I kid you not this is a picture from our building where we were and it was an embarrassment to host people there and and showcase the region and told him yes Michael the mushroom so what has happened this we 've moved to this and it 's taken us a year and a half to get the right place to write friend level and to just some things up the landlord 's pay for all the capex so we 've paid none of the fit-out in the end it 's all been paid for we 've now shared all our services so we no longer own a printer we have to service a printer we no longer have our own phone lines to give you some idea between the 15 people there we pay 15 phone lines 16 computer hookups we pay 320 dots unlimited fiber excess a month when we paid in the vicinity of about 150 ourselves just to have a telecom phone line just for eg LT to give you some idea so we no longer have a lot of these things and it 's a real show case we actually hosted the first Chinese delegation the enders boardroom you 'll see there the front of the rooms is three meeting rooms and we 're all in the a pleasure and they were really good to see to what they 're investing in rather than a welcoming Michael the mushroom and we 'll have the grand opening on the eighth of april so we 'd love to see you there we 've had a lot of people come through but we 're officially opening on the 530 fun five-thirty p.m. on the act of april so please come along and have a look at what the place looks like so I get straight into the next part what we talked about so we 've been talking about a long time time monarchy no entering you a little bit more to us we 've been given some extra money as well to make that happen and sorry Rob and Kirstie it 's taking us a a bit longer but kicking off among Aquino this ad is just appear in the paper and also in the damn news and we 've also talked to Tina Jake 's and alt Yvonne Westerman who is very passionate about manga Pinot and also great Headley and applications closing this week we have got have got this interview panel there that will interview those people put that person place about the end of April we will have a dedicated monkey no support business development support person there who will then also tie in to us and their main first functions will be to implement the business mentors and manga kino and give general support of the business community there terani we have taken a slightly different approach and again sorry Roberts taken us a little bit longer and all you wanted have done faster we didn 't want to do it on our own so what we 've done there and we have to thank Carly Walker green for all the work she 's done there I mean she has been absolutely astounding so tomorrow 11am here during this very room of space i understand we are hoping to kick off the toggle tongariro society looking to form an executive board and in the society we will fund and support and day will appoint a coordinator to make things happen here so ideally we 'd like to have like a fifth of Vanessa a and a fifth of Julie and a fifth over who have forgotten here Julie Ness so we have like a piece of the helmet in there coordinator here looking everything from the town centre renewal to events to tourism marketing to economic development and again the first thing we want to roll out here is the business mentors right now we only have one business mentor in tourney and we 'd like to drive it a bit harder and it 's done from 3 to 18 or Carly 19 and cope alone so we think we can get between five and eight business meeting us here Tori and deliver services to the smaller businesses which are predominantly entering so what this about is really assist connecting the entire district so what that 's also going to mean those people are going to come and be part of our monthly and have meetings at the hub that be part of our team they can come into our environment share the concerns and the headaches or what we call what keeps you awake at night with us and finding solutions for them on to the next one this is a bit of a contentious issue but we did want to report on this one because we spent a large time about nine months last year on the Clean Energy Center and we wanted to talk to you about just about the process that we went through and its decisions that have been made and how we got to those decisions so there 's just a clean slate E and you 're all well aware of where this week this was not part of our brief we understand that but it was an important icon futaba so we felt compelled to UM to assist for this so the way we we had an MOU signed with the user experience in terms of the trustees of the negative development trust to manage the clean instigator for the time being at the same time my trustees were very very clear to me that they wanted to thoroughly understand the business case and the Clean Energy Center strategy before we would make any decision so we had an MoU it was limited for like six months July we had industry briefing and sculpting frustrated at the center and to give you some idea we had Mighty River Power contact Price Waterhouse Cooper ends at tne all the heavy hitters industries were enter at the briefing and we 're collaborating with us and kick drugs and strategies for that building and where we 're to goal with us we then put these thoughts to to attend if I strategy in a business case workup which went on to tender link because we had to make sure we get the best of money here of Basilica our money and September 2012 we awarded to tend up to crane Lee and to give you some idea crane Lee 's an investment bank some based in Singapore but they were to do an investment strategy hours of Auckland one of the partners is Mike Ellen who sits on the board of MRP so they were well versed they 're well understood what was going on here and they were very clear and what we wanted from them and what we wanted was a business case and strategy that would stack that strategy and business case was received by aboard in november two thousand twelve and we 're happy to share that with you and if the six of the scene bar our board voted not to proceed and we subsequently handed the trust of all the management back to the lake toba developing trust now the main reason i Donna going to do these things but the main reason for us is that that we saw that the strategy that we were what we are meant to deliver here and tell Bob did fundamentally not fit with owning a building and that was pretty much what I 'll trust easily imported to just hand out back however we are giving ongoing assistance L DDT we 're still running their website helping them out and looking at filling that building forward-thinking in this is the pipeline project is the work we want to do more off and here 's two things that we want to report on which will fill you with some good news the first one is the land-based aquaculture strategy which we did in conjunction with about seven involved in this which lists the 10 most profitable species of a freshwater that could be found using geothermal enhanced infrastructure and we are handing and this is gone in public so it was embargoed for about a year in which time the investors had like the first dibs at this strategy but we 've just released it in early January and we 're now handing it to accredited investors are interested parties that we that we working through and the other one I want to talk about just briefly most of the sillim Barbara but there 's some good news that will come in the media today is the word strategy for the mill the Intel poll i 'm happy to report that we have found a commercial partner in this town that is 10 on they have invested some serious six figures into driving this project forward we have identified a chinese investor who 's already been through the oii prospects is already pre-approved to be a partner in this project and they 're going on the trade mission live by john key where they 're going to going to be announcing the media later today that 'll be embargo till this afternoon where they 'll be signing an MOU to drive this project the next stage that 's all I can reveal at this stage most of the cylinder a nondisclosure agreement but that is good news I 've got for these projects the other projects we 're still working at the moment is a data center and even though we haven 't started that a lot of work with it but we are doing some work around six at the moment as well and a heat pack now the other one I want to just to talk about briefly and I guess it brings us back to we do we don 't create any jobs at all but some some of the things we work with we 're happy to report on this and Edison the land site that got about up at like five that was one of the first jobs and it was two and a half years ago that we got involved for that and does it you can see that the site that 's almost completed they might attend mega up at the top there but then even smaller like the 10 on wants is put an extra molding shift they 've got that first out of that other project that we doing actually got the first orders going to China and vice versa they 're selling things into the u.s. out of China as well using new zealand as an intermediary and then also some of the smaller ones just to show you that we 're not just dealing on a bigger projects like event rent there 's a really really cool little company run by Donna and as part of the business mentoring she 's taken on a one full-time staff member you might think this is not a lot but tricep a little bit helps skin matters the same that 's a beauty therapy in town they 've taken on one staff member after some business mentoring her interaction with us the next one we want to talk about is the first great laptop of business attraction magazine we 've appointed a project manager we have got sign off eight writers we go forth over some place and we will launched us in on the made of 30th for the magazine don 't get too hung on the color yet please that was just a pitch that the the winning designer made to us of what it would look like and we 're hoping to not hoping we will launch this labor weekend this year and we want you to make this an annual publication it will mostly be about business attraction but we 'll also have a community feel and also showcasing what Tyler Scott just to show people it 's not all about the business a lot of people have come here or to have a lifestyle we interested met with Richard from mere aaka today and he was very strong on that some of their high pay people come here because they love this first so we 're kicking this off and we 're hoping to do not hoping we will do this on an annual basis it will mostly be advertiser based so the first year we are well looking so at the costing of anyway I mean we started off between six and eight thousand publications but we 're aiming the stretch limit we want as 20,000 of those publications being stolen from hotel rooms and to being distributed far and wide the main thing that we 're going to concentrate on us bring out our print numbers and we 're going to come up with some packages where people can buy hundreds or five hundreds of hours for a dollar dollar twenty we 're not quite not more sure the numbers yet but the more the better obviously to an apprentice man you can come into the last one we 've got a kind request to make and it 's not just for me but I thought up this last night and I thought I put it in we have a kind request I know what new counselors come in then this year that we have all these briefings in lava government 's we would love to have the chance of briefing new counselors and also all existing ones with a hump briefing that it 's not just easier to eat as having 23 hour overview of what all the people in a hub do so they off with a flying start and they know the basics of what everybody does and it would be great if we could make that happen and make that part of the induction process when the new counselors come on of course all councillors or any cancer stuff for that metal be very welcome and finally closing up this is mike linville day and so i don 't know if you know if you read the book good to great but it 's a really really good book and i urge you to get it out and what this book talks about it 's not so much about the strategy all the things yes you need all those things but the most important thing is this book talks about is getting the right people and the right seats on your bus and I really like to congratulate Rob for the vision there and putting some of those people in this bus and on those seats because I can cool pretty much any of these people on this any other time and they will answer their phone and there be more than obliging to help us out and I don 't know if you if you acknowledge that within your team or if you do anything about it but sometimes this is a very lonely place and and it is really good to have some of its importance all these people that hold you up when you 're down and I 'd like to thank Rob particular for giving me so much of this personal time to help firstly grow but also to grow donors Ashland the other thing the closing argument there to me is that Tina well its got there around his business um team funny enough I 've just got a profile this morning it 's gonna be another five staff it 's not big but it 's a business that doesn 't exist on top all right now I 'm going to hand out to Gemma and will in a minute and I 'm know that they 're going to have the least amount of red tape pretty much in any district in New a reality and for that we 're really grateful thank you okk many creatures okay well thank you for a great presentation 50 usually and still have that monocle in business should be absolutely brilliant work that you 're doing and it 's great for the district of in what more can I say creating jobs of what terrible that we need growth what for the district 's ogun a very pleased you see the the statue of remaking and achievements if you achieved so far and I think we wish you all the best coming forth because it 's music trailers thank you we will conquer Annette just before you go there is a resolution there are lots available I will it before that the information be received and that the representative representative identified back later after I trust be thanked for the oppressive nation so movie please their caps Williams Sigma can keep women all those in favor say aye aye aye thank you very much suppose hands Temper difference of riverhead thank you _"

    "text": "for summer we ran a campaign called baccarat tune so again instead of just trying to get people down once the whole sentiment behind what we 'll be doing was come once and come again so repeatedly come back to the region and across summer and across season as well so that ran a lot of it was focused on line in social media and throw out front I guess it was around a time to when we were we were reviewing the strategy and books about fiscal responsibility and I certainly went in and reviewed the budget and we had with the two minutes and things so I had a lot of pushed down on the team to really get the best thing but so another example of packing up and responding to what was going on and the region was we had the eruptions in your bodies aware of it at the mountain and an act on your own and so what we did was instead of selling benefiting the media managers we joint ventured with the permit conservation and visit work IV and we formed a professor days of falling joint venture partnership and this is basically a landing area where people could go and get all official information that what was happening on the mountain around the mountain and then activities as well that you could actually take on so it was a really good with one stop shop for all of us to see Amelia for about 16 visitors to say communicating with the market so with a positive spin somebody saw me obviously our with the track ending in Midnight 's and how do you feed back with a long drive hot Sun over the numbers been real real good story I think we 're really fortunate that we 've got a number of operators that are really proactive so what they 've done is instead of kind of sitting back and we 've been engaging a lot with the Memphis at work early as it a different product and so we 've got a lot of product up on the mountain now that is not doing the crossing but doing an imitation and also focusing very much on the new features as well at knowing the different and the other different colors are different beads that are more active so for people that are interested in the activeness obviously the products I think it so to answer your question do we produce around numbers and the numbers are still going up there just doing different things you so um I sites I certainly form part of like the review that we 're doing first and foremost the new ward end I and the industry are looking at reseeding is ready we 've got a dress he saw I on the table with a different direction but i just wanted to raise that you know our view of what we 're doing with the I sites is underway we haven 't actually got to any solution or conclusion around everything we have implemented some things that are are going to help the reason you and however the relocation of the travel center has been pretty much their key and core focus really for and thus boost to the three or four months that opening envoys but yeah we 're really looking at inside our sale house and to go into finance and all of those things as well so looking at the kind of health and wealth of the gong sites assume they 're simply I 'm a priority Steve yeah fishy I 'm sorry and just so i guess the I sites if you I went to the 291 today and I was really impressed to go in there and it 's you know really interesting and lots of thing but I was just hitting a look at only doesn 't save my neck human what you do here to search for a long time and then one lick the bottom under excellence is too damn heavy and my pamphlet but I just kind of lightly scientist a 290 ensign Sato pool is the rapier butts which obviously they have a lot more often you know you know Commission anyone making of does that no means that it 's a man you know and is only one people and if I was a tourist I think I 'll that must be entered and what is that pick it up so yeah just making it 's not just men put on max Tiffany gasps and it also gives a really great people at the teen babe rides yeah and now you can always thinking the other white house is going to feature huge economic development so n down within that pamphlet that doesn 't you know the workers web child doesn 't even people with money nor about energy so i bought that before and they sit on the next slot of pamphlets don 't include those foods but yeah just is part of the district we 've always building down the eyesight used to be a in one of our shops we enter the eyesight site near base camp efforts for our area versus no i start typing available as money people to get information is a taurus should give you it 's a really interesting point person I 've but what we really trying to do is it should come out to the communities and see what they want as long as I yield Epson our OC survivor so I thing at my the key not just last Friday in the board focus group or discussion around you know what were the key priorities or from other people in for and yes there 's been a lot of work done kind of and just to relate to the process and turn only around sitting as an entity so that community has a voice back into like our and our team and so the community was comes into the planning process as well and we spoke and to the group thing to look at meineke know about that whole process as well because I think and rather than I guess listen what is this thats is to hear it from the community we really valid point and through the SOI one of the things that we 've identified us as negative approach so it 's up to business it 's also and they few nights and possibly use a leverage effect effect works to glt so it 's a two-way engagement as they historically don 't feel like I don 't care about us then I want to avoid us notice that I just get up I think that 's so good great just some theaters time yeah I 'm somewhere just gotta hand it I just wondered just intervene me a little bit if you 're going to do networking groups would it be would be helpful perhaps particularly with you I 'll be shot pistol is invited to booking approachable so we 've seen an annotation out to how it goes into deep baby happy no no it 's really i mean this is always welcome to come to our status from a hand yeah i guess its move i 'ma do basel ii good point we 're on it Andrew over so yeah it 'll really engaged so other that 's mean whatever community of course so it comes this way better than my Apple look like finish this Jocelyn yeah you know your strategic overview that you 've done on your phone or operations last time we hear from you that it sounded as if there was some question over whether in fact the I sites where your corbis cousin but now from one getting the impression from your presentation today that indeed your openness and strong focus there still hand chosen destination great lake tahoe or do you do you see another direction for the South sites I think that 's a little differently a matter of process methylating oh and we want to go on the egg review and make sure that you know how the I sites without positions and community the services they give and you know what I be sort of like whole series round do they actually remain a week significant part do we integrate them into a sort of like more for new place because the tourism and travel industry definitely moves quickly and as dynamic so I guess we 're at a process of going do this or belong they are a significant part and how can we doing things better and make sure that everything is performing it at best sort of practice and you know going forward we also have done they are still the shop face for our industry I think that it 's important that we we don 't yeah i guess the knicks it 's really i 'll just quickly go over them because I these 've been on board with Burt with with the changeover would own so we did with your own strategic plan and we 're looking to with donethis cut of the draft and here going out to a number of stakeholder groups and there 's a real focus around keeping it real and actually and both of the things that that this region is certainly not here taken away so mental landscape what all of those things are very much like we are we won for their focus strategically three really key areas and listening and our people and capability within the region collaborating and joint venture with the third regions but also and thorough financial partners that IE being in operators as well as potentially commercially commercial operators anything also taking a special interest approach to maybe then this is just pure regional and what I mean by there as salid in some areas like mountain biking like skiing snow and like youth so that we can we drove down and with experts and those fields to be really effective and it should work most effectively with regional partners like last slide we went out and interviewed a number of operators just to get policies to like we are right now so this is a week to skip the report but what Technic right now this summer we have certainly had some blue be positive feedback from the accommodation sector motels and hotels that have experienced you know best months and january de pieri and really tripping out with forward bookings already been registered in march correct over the operators many of them are feeling at attributes you chose me though we know that that a lot of the outdoor activity operators again are here no any person to the last couple of some seasons are healing a week or per summer so it 's actually feeling and quite positive gasps and the tourism industry and I think we 've recently doing at least to keep it trekking into the one season so 50 questions I 'm sure kicking it up to here Peter that 's right complete listen here just come along i 'm looking at the forecast project going forwards couple of issues with a spot here to of these you yes I just came to get what you 're looking to make can make any other transitions go and the other one is dispersion digitally I since 145k down here for a new web site of my first question was are we building a new website and just some general comments without just register ok so the digital strategies probably one of my key areas of like focus and apart from the other things I 'm certainly in the area weird I hit that quite a lot of experience so part of the review was to actually look at our suppliers and the supplier that delivers our website currently and defect will be going forward and so the whole digital space is not just the website but it will be content production it will be working alongside people actually produced context I 'm not sure if you 're a nice that content on on the wheel and as Ken so that 's working with filmmakers and photographers and not just building a website so my view is that you cannot throw the baby out with the bathwater to like and just come out and clean floor so we 're working alongside the current supply an hour to like work them out we work in a closed source environment and it 's just not meeting our needs so my viewers we review it we rebuild both of you to decline or reduce this reduce the speed around the digital space versus increase so so just follow up if I 'm hearing what you say I 'm essentially got there is intense it 's not yet it 's not delivering on you believe all the way that we should be actually a living in and manually gets to do with the management of the Conte so we need fluid management of the content I thought just because I 'm problems is having to be personalized ones I think it 's good things issue today we 'll get lucky in that but I pointed out previous means of subject gasps website the scheme which is somewhere that silly importantly dollars and there 's been significant and so will be changing direction which it sounds like we got made of that peppers see I think this lingering police bugs up to this point just thought Vince attention to them a bracelet before and that I am glad but something was not that it would be more around an evolution as technology changes and demands to Peter Tom on what kind of content with video needed into a website or watch that was determined speed so the one for me is just one quick question on the increases of this future think transaction which I guess if you take a step back bits kind of what I was referring to and talking denied her around like know the interface on end and while i suck white russians jumping too fast but we need to review is phone to make sure that we have future proof from Oakland since the number of you know and platforms of technology there certainly could but I they are available today and how we were we need to look at you know like what our core businesses does that as it is that going forward and possibly yes but possibly know oh so and what we don I saw that cancer thankfully we have you know has been gone to the attention of the digital we has been a major cross I I i find it disappointing that that new website was a new website was bulb just at least in two years ago and I would just I mean I see that you 've you 're viewing it but i would just um strongly suggest that you prove are you choose providers that are moving with the times because you know this is a huge losses on things they about unnecessary with regards to that but I take on your other points on there Oh God getting down to the TDC overheads this does seem to be taking about taking out of course that does include payroll just regarding league but the store must be a reasonable amount there and I see if you put in a provision that says reduction of overhead costs is the importance on its general IT infrastructure bill the final calculation are still feliz declined by the 12 extra council- tomorrow Jung quiz that cancels be given a copy of that 's you know there is a concern you love that that is one universe took lecture and renew the lease only hits do quite high this is what it is because the seesaw eyes and draft it was where we were be here to reporters will put something and I 'm here to come back so boom sign there may I think coming from it calculate them I just see district silence you 've done some rationalization of the district times and you just perhaps I like what those changes done sure so it 's a significant project and in my first or my motor days of course review the budget so it was quite a high-speed project so i bought rather than delaying it we realized that so i think we hit 15 sites around the region regression line stamp sets making sure that the two sub-regions still kept like a significant design and being actually just reduce like what we were doing it in town what the view to relook at it again everywhere you were working on site and juma in the planning team in one of so we 're scheduled to continue on it and once we 've got it I sigh Trevor seem to be hey and yet the painting hey my choir but they at this point but we certainly rationalized it that way but still scheduled bit to be and I 'm fine thank you do you think for the team just actually mmm would you meet a barbecue last week after that 's what you 've got my commercially development yes they are they potentially fund exercise yes yes yes ok we 'll swim have the variance of some dozen there 's a major increase in and reach along if you like a commute Magenta 's winter little olive oil yeah i think that that was the budget was 5,000 factor of 85 101 can I come back to you on that yellow yeah yeah boy does it like much at times oh i think it 's going to be a reallocation some of yo man so short requests that you come back to the details just changing allocation I guess it 's not natural my index presented as a percent increase one that you put up and the sir sighs at Harbor your location complete and saving margining and we also say sheer students across other leading efficiencies I suppose them at home because you 've got almost it 's cheaper yeah nothing is it an allocation of the other pairs like my weed evolution okay you feel the numbing biblically please refer you to page one by one the street suggested resolutions that this place is great i cover it 's going to be thinking of different tension I 'm sure you 'll do that well healthy and the council received is no greater kappa tech stocks report to the denver 20 12 and the county will see destination graduate our first draft statement 14 15 14 13 year we are

welcome and days you know we as you can see we 're doing our council meeting this month this time and to ready because we 're very conscious that there are two beautiful other three so we try to share the love so here we are down in two easy so if you 'd like to come forward lovely ladies and maybe one more to see someone oh you 're not ok ok so for this one will just hear back Kathy and Vanessa so Rock 'em and I 'll hand over to you thank you very much and for those I haven 't_''_89.09 met you I 'm Cathy guy from The Da Vinci rat 302 unconscious that we only have 15 minutes in which to proceed to you so are you from I report for you breathe and allow Vanessa to access your own show some of the results that DG LT has been able to achieve in the round six months the last six months have seen an exciting time for change within the board and we can go see this needs to go the appointment of three you local board members in Sevilla 2012 have added a different dimension to the board and introduce new skills focused on industry knowledge on finance governments and proceeds as a board we 're very drives are 60 and therefore a strong emphasis was placed by the new board on DJ or TV moreover business with fiscal accountability the paramount and focus on business process and best practice we were fortunate during our recruitment in subsequent and appointment process to have Vanessa Freeman there 's a successful candidate and in late October should hook up the role as beginning of destination great lake taupo as a result the new board placed a number of deliverables on the new GE which required these to be completed with them for a 90-day trial period we as a board recognized that those deliverables were how to ask for someone to pick up and achieve within such a tight timeframe however it was important that these deliverables were action within this timeframe to effect change these deliverables have had a sustainable content and will continue to be used within our strategic plan to ensure that the focus and change and engagement is ongoing in December the board met for a two-day strategic we 've shot to review the existing SOI and to establish a strategic focus and write the during this process we had the opportunity on the first morning to listen to and engage with tourism Brazilians who were doing the presentation on the national strategic focus it was invaluable as we were able to ensure that our current and our draft SOI also fitted into the ethos and focus of tourism you zealand was advocating both from a national and also a domestic sorry Lynette mr. sweet we 've been particularly conscious of the difficulty in continuities the two at DG or table team particularly in the hiatus period awaiting the appointment of the new GM and we as the board also are very appreciative of the work done by the interim GM risotto and the knowledge and guidance that he bought the team during this time the team and continued to be productive and is now working well together with a new project tourism tough concept implementing new strategies under the guidance of vanessa is a new gene and in line with our SOI they are strategic business plan as a board we are particularly aware that was industry is a fickle one and requires the it 's imperative that there is an awareness and appealing to some form of risk management and a process to ensure the RT over Tampa district remain sustainable as a desired tourism destination for our future to have a destination that remains relevant for visitors and reflexive a of its people and its environment for years to come under Panthers ambition the objectives have set out in the draft sry will enable detailed T to build on what has already been achieved to deliver the outcomes communicated instruct drugs to teacher clean and we are confident at the board that the combination of both the SOI and strategic plan will ensure that the RTO delivers on the objectives of government building and thriving visitor industry in the left upper region and therefore deliver an ongoing economic benefit to our district and what they hope a sign on Vanessa to discuss in detail some of the objectives internal change obviously I 'd like to say that I was absolutely delighted to take up position of doing major destination quite liked opal and it 's no secret that travel and tourism industry the last couple of years and we we shared it both from a regional and national perspective I think yeah international visitors coming and to the country only our region and it has certainly been challenged so what I thought I 'd do is I just take it taken that my six monthly report in seaweed and but I thought I would go straight to kpi 's and just talk a little bit around that so that I had the tough ideas task some skits to be reporting which respectively so I 'm reporting for the July to December hour period and so I wasn 't_''_426.47 at the only do med position for three of those months so what I will be doing is just going through we were it with the current kpi 's and against are currently so I because we and here it a bit in then and looking at some of the phones that have been done in the three months that I 've been in the lead position as well so if we look at our KPIs and apparently so I is the first objective commercial accommodation in me costo currently are we sitting on roughly about 435,000 East nights and there is for that delight receiver period what I wanted to highlight the air is that to multiply that number by 2 is not presentation of the four year since I 've Brittany was at least to be before anything yet just to give you an indication of how the Commission accommodation scepters tripping over the january-march period and we 've had some feedback we 've interviewed about nine operators and two or three of hotels in particular and a number of the motels here trapped excellent results and genuine people some of them are reporting with this figurative ever Hill general protector they said that look at bskyb river any forward bookings and March are looking positive as well so i think we are six to achieve that paper you are quite comfortably and again our website traffic we 're trekking via as well in a new draft and strategic plan we 're looking to tweet all that ke ha ok POS SI to annual visitors surveys and a visitor what 's a 't actually report almost keeping cozy until the year so if we drop into a quick impress and stakeholder engagement and participation we are achieving on focus group commitments I stage the youth and backpack focus group we were so gone into our corporate area so our convention bureau and he focus groups are gained with some good results with steering Brooks coming out of them and again Mike he is identified with we certainly new strategic approach going forward we might have been driving down some of those key areas where we can when we can perform we 've also gone out to turn lane en manque aquino and engage with the industry so i guess again quite confident that we are achieving and their participation in state population maria is it december 2012 like sailing and report we 're checking it a seven thousand dollars in our joint beach fun as well and they are sites more effective eyesight what this is the currently so I and again we 're going back to get these words are new draft is summarized I 'm sure some of you and up to a fiscal responsibility kpi or an ejector boosters just something in the eyesight area year-to-date our results are trekking to achieve however we 've done or I 'm coming to the number of initiatives or we inside their eyesight area and to improve early business performance so we 've reduced staffing expenses and intermediate booking fee and to do some processing and face as well so again checking to achieve and those areas even immediate can 't know just I think it 's important to note that when the isight budgets were formulated last year they didn 't take into account that 2008 here which is a spectacle pretty much just pushed it over to 2012 so it 's a bit hard to have a possible year-on-year given the fact that they were such an unprecedented number of international visitors region jujin google there 's a number of sort of deliverables come out of like that i play area was goal which the content rating lines not just that we knew that we are getting in from commissions to so and so what I thought I 'd do 's already been to love it and they just came into July period this most perceptive early and I wasn 't part of and the team at DG LT and it up and so what if what I 'll do again is just quickly refer to and the results they came from this so get away was a joint venture with Channel nine in Australia because Australia was nominated as the key international market we need to work with that 's the biggest international map coming into the region so get away it 's probably one of the longest and triple shows in Australia at which is over five hundred and twenty thousand people each episode and we were over three episodes and we engaged with a team partners to deliver this so we had the announcers throughout the region and conti Regional Climate engine three so identical video to show you but I 'm consciously on borrowed time so we 'll just like key role and grab it was our one to campaign for last year again a joint venture partner I with any Zealand the website brand so of that I guess the biggest ones were you know the participation really and I guess the results themselves from a reasonable one of you tuned about dollars in the product order online however the other things that came out of that from a joint venture perspective and drawing not only our tourism operators together but our retail sector and the wire kind of like town to deliver quite a quite significant campaign we 're probably as these results it 's mental Empress funny so where did you get the most responsible man both some those other destinations to talk about during the river and i don 't know that i need to find it out there because it was a campaign it was run and why it what I wasn 't there but I can definitely find out that and massively yeah I think that you find that the majority were part of england george it would come out a little crunch that was nearly out on that for now from the hotel sister please hey wanna go and just I 'll just while it 's playing on Survivor bike magazine this video or DVD was popular with a large amount of total content and it was distributed to the 75 the others are more subscribers of the magazine so this change and came into the region that all mountain bikers change the first time you type of approach to marketing we are really starting to take so instead of actually doing the whole continent region with we put inside and rather so I a more special interest imposing Manning watch meaning basically focusing on how thick your table and also browsing regions so we had a large or we 've got a lot of mountain biking content and how we worked with our regional partners are raw raw hey who and the total region and expose pervert as well so it was really talking to Australian mountain mountain bikers to come into that sexual violence region to mountain by another initiative that we partook and last year was talkin on North Island and till the North was a joint venture with tourism New Zealand so we had other nor funding partners alongside us I guess the best results selling against other both partners like all kinds all come through 250,000 chosen New Zealand was in the region of I think we have 400 and the other smaller regions that set around we in this set of 50,000 center so they combined funds really talk their whole investment up in our imagery the mine Bay imagery and some of the imagery around ruapehu was used and like some very large outdoor and marketing and Melbourne was born in Sydney and the results from that were significant the Australian and hips on the tour of the museum website and then what drilled down and to the lake toprol area we really were fairly large and the flight center especially you see flight see depict our inventory up and just at all and store marketing futur the North using their image so let 's sort of advertising and our key markets in Australia they suddenly Melbourne and Brisbane we just couldn 't pay exit of life coverage so it was really significant I 've done is actually up and will come today which I was in New Zealand in their group should really get up and look and look at director and speech special interest way as well meaning really focus it on mountain biking possibly this year or something that that all the regions share so it 's just resolved _"

    "text": "hummus called approaches 0 also asked what you 've completed the secretion of metal you know we good or whether you I would reveal that on that point where I complete the block is another question on the school is very great enthusiasm towards the wonderful article about new on the stream I just wonder if he realizes then our and our draft inner planets and their twice if you mean XP yes um if I might just if you know can I just go to this and I just want to walk you through all of the changes that we 've made just to make sure we don 't forget one I 'm not very good oh ok I 'm rubbish at multitasking I can only be one day at a time and not feel it i 'm a bit Lydia please thing to note is just that we 've given your copy of the statement of compliance and which has to go into the drug angle plan this will go on the page immediately after the chief executive pieces so it opens with mr. premier of counselors maybe have a statement of compliance which just says that with what overalls and what it would mean that is too and then we turn over we come true what is labeled page 10 of 85 so it 's new information going on trip a team of your every strictly it starts on page 8 of the big 50 documents we put a new scene and sign under that financial strategy this is a point that Neil 's already address just around the balanced budget issue effectively using proper sales to bridge the difference between operating and um costs and expenditures and then we come to guess the tap waters story and somebody and I don 't know who simply cancel the Johnson I think asked me to make it explicit for people at acacia beta mark but they 're actually not affected by the tap o tempo or the skins we make that change um just you know it counselor Williams point the stories in there twice yes it is we just figure that when you 're in a documents probably be about 150 pages long this sets right at you lie and then it 's it 's also specifically in the word story so we 're looking for any lines we looking people to board us that story is there and it will be an identical stories like closes I just a minor in regards to your community about the national drinking water standards the CEOs new digits the new zealand drinking water standards but throughout the rest of the document and summary national written those letters i just wanted that they would be well be clarifying something i think this is here we 're using different language he 's talking about a very particular set and i 'm just talking about it in a generic way it 's kinda like difference between tim tams hex capital t + biscuits is just a lowercase p it 's not we could I just hate alerts get the leaders but we will do we will NCDs wwe 's think you will make it come yes thank the damn thing can I probably should or that I 'm the earlier session but what caps orders here going back to pay to see probably a new board or community that would have raised the expectation and I wonder if you it is actually what we want the community to expect and you 've or whether it might be more previously to investigate the need for a new ball means you have immunity thank you if we need come down to these tables there 's all sorts of changes there the visitor residential impacts and terms of these and new funding requirements and having gone round with droughts going one and sex get back into thirds get that one and I to get back everybody came everything can we just get the percentages please so these tables have now been changed to reflect the edge with the scene urges affected within each of the major categories so just kind of you know to show you this you know half of residential properties pay a hundred dollars up to one hundred dollars more rivalry which is less than two dollars a week or you know in two tiny teens in a Brazilian property rates between sick we just had that in actual percentages and so those matrix photos we use the workshops and then we turn on one more page you see we 've even got some pretty graphs now this is not the final version of this document this is the word version and obviously designed to make it look even better but there 's just to give you an idea of what these grants look like so that 's more of the changes if you like that are proposed and to the actual drug being a plan and they 'll see is a bunch of different is showing some of the major residual groupings and also some of the other rain pattering so rural pockets or industrial commercial coffees and then everything else in the draft came right through peeps over seven stays is it is that we pick up those changes that have been suggested in terms of the Waikato regional collaboration and we will get at seven thousand dollar reference into that and will also pick that language up and put it into the summary as well because split the list of you know put two years and put that eras was page 62 in this of 85 measure sector steps in your funding impact statements i 'm going to ask never talked about okay so this is just wanted to point again it 's just something dumb brought up and talking to some reason always just ten core point of regarding we just added a sentence your rights payment to the allocated deals in because it 's just a technical point around basically paint off the old theaters before the new did and this just tightens up that um that s speaks especially around the charge of the pumpkin for outstanding oaks they will see the other actors um you can then delayed there was delayed has been delayed sentiment on Delaney pack spelling not sure yet but we actually got another version that 's got formalin we 've had a proofread and all those typos but rather than put a whole bunch of typos track changes in front of you thanks selling me but if you want to give us anything that you 've identified it would be useful and any other thing that cup of tea citizen scenes coming to that I 've given you a new version of the summary that it 's doing here ah excellent they do to bring most mighty ginardi grateful um see if I think we really hope it 's it 's not anything substantial it 's just playing with you doing language and I just I just want communications interview clear everyone out there a lot of people read that but they might read that as they would both here see the structure different ways in different things no no I I do take the point in my movie breakfast because I 've winners and just I you had one visiting of the summary and then i cabled another version for you and just way to know which one you 're looking at the new one in the bottom table has language in bloom on the right hand column and users percentages and that table again matches up with the tables are just people about in the actual drug dealer plan so as I say people save this one in six hundred five two and three I don 't know how we put it back to that and because we have some fun with we 're not quite a major kind of you know cost-saving exercise with the summary we have quite a lot of space limitations with that it 's likely that it most little bit full breasts and with that so what we 've done is back support and kind of biggest at the residential settlements or four times in our district to just kind of throw one of those impacts of those and again is this the language issue on top of water and if you just go to keep turning over to we get to the new projects this year we will now add in a new heading for democracy and planning and we will put the wake an original story that we 've just been discussing will go in there as long so that people can feel confident that it will attract submissions so that kind of takes us through the changes to the draft engel plan since the last vision we gave you changes to the summer instance for life fusion we gave you which come back to the actual councillor vendor item and I 've given you a track changes version of that as well so you see these that paint on the resolution there but mr. Ward 's advised us is required under section 100 of the local government act we can turn out in the page 3 bar 1 we 've also put an additional paragraph and they 're just explaining what that 's about and that paragraph is also actually interrupting your plan it 's identical language and it kind of brings me being with the things that I need to talk you 're teaching basically week this has been a blow one exercise has agreed to a job in teaching projected low very much for a very long time got a lot of loss telephone without reducing services and I think the attention moving forward to even better in the future like throughout today to see this document ever affect what happens 12 months mot a second in the time I go out for of the consultation i presently will be very very surprised if you having a matter of got cheese it 's the result accessories my infant and go so unless there 's more to say I would like to ask that if the I 'd love to do it myself but I don 't think it 's right what I would like to ask that it was mover and seconder for the resolution but before I do with a their movement or movie wall decor I just have a creative that 's very good you don 't think I can 't making a move it happily in the particular vibe is right before i do i clarify your theory just a little is serene and absolutely when you crave this hey Wes water it 's jose maria and reach optimizer tyranny plan as a nitrogen removal job for a hogfish and 1 million dollars hoppers anything Britta 's ania mr. Louis that will increase the at the moment looking at the optimization or the plan and about three or four different areas have been looking at who 's the upon the looking in at the moment Evans also deplaning offering spr focus you 're telling me even great now they 'd nitrogen removal take the pic you might put on the top like a quickness that will make exaggerated yet so simply inquire plans will be your platinum card removes consider much you 're going to give your favors million to remove more nitrogen it 's to optimal management see off the fat so in college students and things like that give you attention and they cover detective Chuck the rear of this sort of to the protest and I 'm on a committee of removing and amenities and nitrogen games late and if I 'm sitting here listening correctly in my layman 's language you 're telling me that have a district council things are more money and remove some more nitrogen from a pressure right thank you but that 's the bonus out of doing those skins are working officially so they would often than having these impacts upon the second year I just want to go to my favorite picture first but that 's what they 're mandated to do and I see those dots between drink together but that if for your hood on council hickory ln sigma and William all over in favor Biden against Eric then mostly thank you very very much on our toes leading a troop _"

    "text": "if I might just address a couple of the points you 've raised just just be a clarification the reason why it wasn 't and it is now actually proposed in the drug angle plan but the reason we didn 't put it in initially is because the bullet point stories we were highlighting with things that when you were different so what a treatment plan sucks being built in exercise looking it 's a new story the toilets form under keno in fact battery that 's new so we were focusing on what 's different from the LGP in fact we always have funding under the democracy and planning and fruitive activities for a whole range of regional collaboration activities and so we didn 't necessarily think to pull that out as a specific item however in the section of paper you 've got with the rent paid on the front of the statement of components if you tuned to the second page limit back you see democracy and planning which is the group activities so the rig set like would statement of compliance on the front and I proposed and you 'll see it in red there an additional product when surround activities continue to explore options for stronger regional collaboration particularly in light of amendments to the local government act so that 's specifically refers to that seventy thousand dollars proposal I mean let 's face it we also do a bunch of collaboration with plenty so this is not to make so that it doesn 't like I send in any particular future direction but it ladies council to keep learning about what 's the implications of all of its collaboration options to clean up a little yes your worship um at least I 'm an under left side under legislation we are too I 've take this collaboration but I would say that this would be prefer God 's the joint management agreements and I 'm on the waking the river just from the meetings we 've had today I can see that they are going to take a lot of time and probably a lot of capsular cuts officer time and also teach the consultant time not only with with all the various be each Tamizh along a river so I would suggest that there would be an ideal opportunity for this castle stop pushing back through and ron chill and I Local Government Association who say this is an emotional if Cyrus fingers on it very nice if the mess okay well what I 'm going to do is about my DVD also wrong this issue have an example a cutter River Authority agreements or deal with whatsoever will it be separate with a mayoral forum which has no mandate it 's only at forum where they meet and talk to each other as a little bank account doesn 't have a mandate whatsoever to amaze can get a room to locally freely volatility teller at what they 've come up with my mom and I would regress the same as a knee-jerk reaction to local government perform however how all this is ammar go to after the 21st play be very careful with what I 'm saying I 'll hand it over to Jesus Williams to try and except like a vegetable yep it 's all the reason of the mayoral forum and educate itself as a forum so that it can take information back to very regulated councils about the issues that have been discussed by central government in the wider community and the headline obviously being amalgamation and what these the four work streams of the mayoral forum set up and they were in democracy and planning the three water 's Rogan which is being driven by using Transport Agency regulatory throat in waters lovely too many guys economic development and and so in most four areas that the mayoral forum that wanted to educate themselves in terms of what what potentially can be achieved by combining forces across the Waikato so there 's been a lot of talk centrally in central government about spatial planning because of the Auckland plan and should every other region have a station plan that is similar to look like a problem with that being a district plan type of document it comes with a huge cost to like them into place New Zealand if we start getting into rewriting all of our district plans in one document typically to get a district plan if i 'm wrong though if it can do about five million dollars by the time you 've gone from eight instead of getting one of those dr. Lutz operation so try and attempt that on a regional basis yes it might achieve certain things and it might achieve certain outcomes that central government want in terms of simplicity across the region but the the male form wants to be educated incentive one what is the benefit for the books that we spend heads the creation of the forward extremes now there was a media release that was put out from the marrow for and following the meeting that they had attendees on the eighteenth of februari and basically what that it might never read that media center because I think it gives some clarity as to what 's happening so the media release is entitled further steps towards major savings for regional ratepayers a work program designed to generate multi-million dollar savings from regional ratepayers is being forwarded by the way cutter marrow forum to the region 's local and regional councils for consideration before are made of obsidian the receive reports on work screams designed to improve cooperation on planning in government 's economic development roading water and waste services the detailed briefing all of the other regionals regions councilors is due to be held on the twenty-fifth emerged to spell out the details of what 's proposed the opportunities and the suggested funding arrangements for progressing the work swings also be included further information will be provided to stakeholders and the media immediately following the briefing what that 's basically saying is that a lot of the detail is actually embargoed at the moment it will be released to the regional regions council laws on Monday because what the mayoral forum was concerned about was every council were going through their annual plan at different times I didn 't want one capsule to get ahead of the other councils in terms of that information tried to pull everything together into one date so in the meantime individual councils are being advised of the provisional contribution sought from them by way of sap time or funding in advance of the work streams a quote from give oak and councils come up with an integrated package of work this is designed to help councils collectively come up with the options for saving rate payers money and for creating other efficiencies in the way that councils work on behalf of their communities and there 's nothing more in the press release that adds to that but basically that gives you a flavour as to why the 1.3 million is being put forward to the meeting on Monday mayoral forum has been very clear that it 's an important issue for consultation with the community because the community we will decide where it wants to go but I 'm only those work streams are about informing ourselves what the issues are and what the potential is not actually trying to suggest a particular out well for me I 'll be quite a hunt at the end I young for that long and had a big day for a whole lot of hooey cottage on google at work on time and on record website I 'd rather go it 's been a hundred and thirty thousand dollars on past you and for it please release if I had no idea that we as a council until you disappoint us that we as a council with some obligations it wasn 't and I wasn 't Paul I wasn 't played trust and and I find a class i mean when i read i would suggest that actually there 's some words around us that go on to that angle pen because when i read here stronger regional collaboration I 'm as far as I was consumed that was go and which are taking a lot of fun resistors but i had no idea what the other fun time aside artists suspecting me is fine wonder why we that 's one of us today because everything it 's been trying to buy the tail we the step away from us what we doin it I believe if you do exercising for it only my opinion but that 's what I was on the table to get to that you did for them if you want to leave them one of my big things I want to tell them it knows it off it 's but i wonder if of neon lights just like if you ever leave them be yeah I 'm sorry yeah I mean that 's what my face looks time this year so I had to go through the papers we actually go to me like just on this and it 's confidential which is quite in our CEO is actually settle on data plan that has actually got all the costumes of cost us in you 've got this in Hebron and I 've kind of highlighted a few things and you know like in the air about unitary and stuff like that I think especially after attending the RMA workshops up and load Rua and administer via saying that they underneath the army may they not making that man back back to be more inclusive with regional Queens and district plans and what the elections coming up I think it would be a good thing to go along with us I think there is this and this memo does say that it 's not a it 's not a formal decision making body advocating any particular ring reaping not that they are doing is you know as we said the planning governance even on Phillips water and wastewater services and because you don 't know who 's getting a little and all the different councils in the regions and those years I believe that will get a lot out of habit us by being in that I think in my first em it 's 25 in assuming 70mm 21 trees probably should be at this time of the way teacher it 's not a formal agreement it 's an agreement benefit for new years and councils in the future so it 's the fun of two pieces that this 100k our share of the 1.3 million esli size moments without adverse factors oh yeah oh right yeah so just going to go to perform and everybody the paper won 't have the same on the back making sure that the marrow form have tried to express the simpler the chief executives that they want to minimize any money those consultants so lost their budget severe they are I 've instructed the cheap as it is to do as much of the organizations that the local authorities are structural ladies it is so you may experience mr. William considerably better than 1.3 million dollar what money is not ever going to consult of spirited yes that 's a finger in there sort of thing but I would come from what I 'm gauging from from around the places possibly higher might be saved by using internal resource I 'm under the food absolutely yeah I think I feel a little bit more confident probably after them but just reading this these red lines to me if the company idea to the general public where is one of these the toilets we list the fact it was 24 centares office of life and deep his Mary dollars put towards the sentence so we could probably even come on understand I 'm for the purpose a latecomer again sorry I just need to cook qualified at the moment those figures are actually embargoed by the mail for them to move closer so we are mere SE se so there will be a link to make information papers released on the twenty-fifth a fine it works for our annual plan because we have the informations under consultation certain other local authorities that timing didn 't work in that created example you happy embargo something Bioware people that had my name are we going to approve this fraud we proposal of an amendment after the 25th if I over here what we 'll do is we 'll build in the information and release the consultation stuff with all of the right information because we do to go out on the same day so it doesn 't affect so we can have all the information we 're having a group people that have no mandate no formalization we just agreed to meet them with custom van table and by vehicle and through the chair two or three points I 'd like to make one this is a draft and plan that is going out for consultation will be submission on any number of items those are just seventy thousand dollars out of millions and millions of dollars it 's a plan that we will make these s weeks apparent as I say it with the also consider any other changes that occur EG folks the twenty fourth of july but basically this council continues to be either a team player or not a team player and respected the reason for which it is part of well have two responses of that fisher this council had a mandate that we would be team players at the base building and secondly to that if on all these millions of all the secretary 2000 doesn 't mean so much wave we agonize so much happening through it and for the neon Watson or anything we have shown it separately because it is different to what the original long-term plan mods as Helen committed earlier we have a budget within the long-term pain as far as regional collaboration and as such that budget has not changed if it is just being reallocated in a different direction under the school regional collaboration as far as the toilets are consumed they were not on the originals long-term clean we in producing a draft any plan which is year two of the long-term plan actually identify where things are different between what thinking of a handful on neural more my cancer they 're here to govern if they worship at the end so the edge if they wish yep Soviet for that cover for the wakeup solicitor counter downer with magazine the order says that the investment suggested and the witch drinks proposal is made of saving millions of dollars to resort beaches I mean that that can be achieved it 's a well with indecent as far as the red light Vanina in Gaza I suppose we explore the options beyond there at the stage one community supporting for example is this the forerunner to a regional military those questions are wider just a sec local body the third thing is explode all of the council 's fieles subscribe as received to be Parvati regionally three does that face the civilization within the medal for the husbands of discussion around that they literally think it for certain because they he turns up on Monday makanda to be an interesting exercise that 's good I suggest and everywhere well at the draft and you peg down after submission they 're going to 'll be able to talk to him about during the consultation process when it comes out kimo songs and this one messaging around the waco and those might work extreme projects going for as long as that something yeah I do actually support beam to this just for but I really do think they should be automotive see I will be able to it might see those dollars that 's the point i stick to talk but if you don 't point out we can simply turn bottle to toilet it 's layman 's language in my or why can 't we sometimes between 70,000 on being part of a team and leading the district into this cost-saving DJ they day that my executors much like to see how insane is trying to be in the wall know what it would serve it on one way or another whether then you can make a decision me as counsel do oh he 's also said what I was going to and I get 50 states you know I guess the literally in any event so the records will actually had my of of this forum because it 's a small district we really need to the voice and agreed if we don 't be part of a squirrel may we deprive our region realize corpsman ability of what to be some community is our regional council level audience and you see a pattern for education and also another time I thought has do not ever that 's very foolish just confirming we can put the words in now because they we don 't start consultation two different some bareback document somebody goes into the transcript and then the words of fun that 's what I want to hear words in there that you have reallocated as I understand on the office budget well as an outside to collaborative the teamwork of weight good that we 've clarified that and will be those changes made for you they 've obviously all part of what is been published I just after that I guess red wine from Nikolas counsel from phone calls I 've had people which usually after this guy that comedian at Monday _"
