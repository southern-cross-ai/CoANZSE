    "text": "thank you everyone who is here much appreciated um we or I 'm Bo and many things above me or beside me depending computer thanks so much to the city of Melbourne 's team for hosting us it 's a really great idea and we really start to have been asked these webinars are commissioned by the city of Melbourne arts team so thank you so much Ivana and Hannah and everyone there we 're going to be exploring three topics over the next three weeks so this is the first ones so next Thursday same time and the Thursday after that we 've posted our social media handles into the chat room so just sort of and please post yours so that we can see them as well and we can get a transcript of the chat so that we can follow everyone for social media the hashtag for this session if you 're posting anything which would be great if you did is hashtag creative Melville and hashtag sole traders podcast and make sure it 's all traders because there is a sole trader podcast but we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that where there 's more than one of us and that is why we are sole traders so today 's topic is creating your online presence practical tools tips and tricks sure we just dig in and you know have maybe just maybe unpick what an online presence might mean for you and me infinitely and we 'll we start you can contribute questions as we talk got a lovely Yvonne here in the background who he 's gonna kind of collate them and and you know about halfway through the session we 're going to start answering those questions and addressing um you know any of your concerns that anything that comes up for you while we 're talking so just go ahead and put them into the chat you know I love looking at this chat window it 's so good and her vans in the back like Adriana anxieties like just so beau you know what we normally do in our podcast is we share our own experiences first so I 'd like to know what your online presence has looked like over over the last little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other Barents yes so over the I think everyone would have had this experience when you 've been you 've sort of got personal things like Facebook and then you might sort of start a business or you know something else and then that 's got one name so I think I 've had pretty desperate a very desperate online presence in the past I have had a blog that was under a different name it was called design satellite I 've had and that had a twitter handle and a its own Instagram account and all these other things and I found that it 's actually really it 's been really hard to manage and also to have changed names and stuff like that so why is that well when you chant so trying to so say something like design satellite was about regional creatives and I was writing and photographing them and then it was quite hard with that framework to then bring I couldn 't either had to change the name of that Instagram account or to Bo Wong or then I sort of so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can 't really it 's really hard for me to bring those followers over so there 's one so one thing that I guess one of the biggest mistakes I 've made with my online presence is that I 've I 've sort of had to more than I can manage I I don 't really use Twitter I can 't get into it and Linkedin I use a little bit but not really with Facebook I had I left Facebook when I was 30 early 30s and then restarted a new account because I think I just felt like yeah sort of moving into a more professional sort of section of my life and I just needed to have all those other photos of me looked in yeah also always had websites being a photographer an e-portfolio website so I 've had various websites which have updated probably every three to four years and yeah so that 's kind of pretty much just the clarity when you say updated do you mean like how often would you update the content or are you talking about the whole framework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole thing so that 's like where I employ a web designer graphic designer and just do a full re redo of the web site usually that 's because things change technology changes there 's you know points with now people mostly accessing things on their phone so you need to make sure that it can really flow on a phone and stuff like that so that kind of stuff to do with web design I think it does need I 'm pretty clear yeah and when I I 've recently updated my website with all the larkin and I know that it 's not going to be forever I know that it 's going to have a three or four year lifespan and I can update the contents of it and you know update my workshop details and stuff like that but I 'm not going to yeah but I 'm not yeah you just have to they just don 't go forever and ever website so yeah what about you what about your online presence yeah and so I guess I 've got two sides to it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally I had I 've had a couple of iterations of a personal blog in this sort of life style interviewing artists and and sharing like craft projects and stuff like that which I wrapped up about four years ago because I found that I just wasn 't keeping it up and I feel like something that on the that 's out there on the online and or in social media that 's not it 's not up to date I think it doesn 't serve you basically and I would always question if something you haven 't updated something in in say a year and when I say update I mean fresh content um I think it 's it 's a good idea to have a really hard think about whether that 's serving you still and whether you need to maintain that and then professionally I 've worked with like in a lot of capacity with businesses and an InDesign sort of agencies with websites blogs email newsletters social media so probably I think if I had to choose one to give an example I would choose stack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think probably most people tuning in would know stuck words a big warehouse it 's got a concept store it 's a creative venue to venue for hire it 's got out of Studios so when that business Sarah started that business and brought me on board I guess in terms of online presence for sack wood there were some important questions to ask and I think they relate across the board for everybody who 's tuning in what do we need this website or this or this social media platform to tell people about stack wood or another way to put it is what story do we want to tell through this website or this Instagram account and I think that that 's a really important question to ask and I think a lot of people forget that very fundamental step is just like what are we trying to say here what is the story we 're trying to tell so actually the first story about stock wood was basically what is it which is like a warehouse which houses all these creative things and is trying to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills and plants and also like what it is and also where it is because when it 's first started it was in an area of Fremantle bordering like gum Valley where you know except for people who were very much local to that area people didn 't know what it was and that 's really shifted in the last few years but at the time it was basically the wasteland boondocks sort of area of Fremantle so that was the challenge and that was a story we tried to tell and in fact we built the website around key images that you took oh if you 're in about that space and that was all about trying to tell this story of what not even what we 've done but what we were trying to do and trying to bring people in along for the ride so that was the story we were trying to tell and I guess for my business at the moment I 'm actually on maternity leave and my online presence is very lean it 's very pared back it is basically my Instagram account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very active on and that 's where I do most of my storytelling and an email address which is my which has my domain name in it it 's Amy at Amy 's nook stroke on and that is how I run my business and at the moment because I 'm not very really working very much and not taking on many new clients that 's all I need like that 's enough because I work on prefer ORS basically and that 's all I can handle and what I 'm aiming to do is have a website in the next few months that is just basically a contact page at the landing page with a way to contact me and then I 'll move into the next six months having a full website that you know that tells story that has a blog that you know all kinds of other things I mean people even like with the way that Instagram is going even need websites so I think it 's a really important question to ask yourself do I need a website so for me at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more work for me more outlay for me to hire a designer or to do it myself and I don 't have that time and I don 't need the work I actually you know the best way for me to get new work is by referrals because I 'm leveraging that creative community I already have and people are bringing me in and I want to work with those people already and you know that that is a beautiful thing and that 's how I prefer to work anyway so I think it 's an important question to ask whether words that will serve you your business comment in the chat just saying you know yeah it 's a it 's a fair question around this store you know what is the story and also around I think this person means is about websites like are they necessary and I think that 's I guess the first question that we would sort of put there for the idea of online presence that people think that they have to have Twitter LinkedIn Facebook website Instagram all these stuff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to ask what 's gonna serve your business and what 's going to tell your story the best yeah but also where where are your community and where are your potential clients or the people that you want to interact with or who might buy your art or where are those people and where can you best connect with them and tell your story so I think you 're not going to um yeah if you 're not going to be present on Twitter don 't have a Twitter account just don 't you know here 's your permission slip don 't do it yes I hate Twitter and in that bow we 've got a few examples which I might just put in a comment examples of people who have built their businesses on an Instagram account one in particular without a website at all and that was Katie marks flowers that whole website her whole business was built on an Instagram account which is amazing and then we 've got new design studio Marianne Moody and of course added cement the Dennison an artist she does have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect I think so it 's really worth just having a look at her that she you know has a bit of the behind the scenes and the process and you know people are really interested in that stuff I think when it comes to creative practices there we 've talked about this a lot people are really interested in what 's happening behind the scenes as well as what it is that you 're selling or offering yes thinking and I think that do you think Samantha uses that he uses that platform Instagram as like a blog like how some people may have used the blog in the past or currently use their blog yeah so the website is much more she 's having an exhibition and here are the paintings that are in that particular exhibition and here 's the person here 's the gallerist you can contact and that 's just very you know dry I guess it 's you know but I guess you know services actually the Instagram account is what brings new people in same with my webs my website doesn 't bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where people just need to check and know that I 'm a professional and know that I can nail the job so it hasn 't had to you know have to find new people or and I also don 't so you know I don 't have an online store so I don 't have any of those capabilities people just need to land there find out what they need to know and then they 're out so go if you need to say like one function or like the main message that you want people to get from your website like what would that be or has it just changed when you redid your website like what would the main kind of story or message be all yo part is mainly to tell people that I have you know high production values and can shoot high stakes projects now is it also about like the variety of of like of the work that you do and what you bring to a shoot beyond just your skills as a videographer I also show things that I like that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's also the thing because I I 'm not going to show stuff that I 've done that I didn 't that I don 't want to do more of that type of project I 'm only going to keep it to things that I 'm wanting to do more obso that 's that 's the only things I 'll put in my portfolio yeah yeah and can I also just attention to this one that we put in the chat window it 's a local graphic design web design studio called new design studio and I 've put that one in because they very successfully use Instagram purely as a portfolio page it just reads like the grid just reads as a block that shows their current project so I think that 's quite an innovative way to use Instagram and I think that feeds into their website too so you get the same view um and that 's how they 've decided to set things up which I think it 's really innovative that consistency across online platforms I think is you know it 's something that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do notice other people do it a lot better than me but it 's interesting some of the work that you 've done with coaching clients and including me this work around you know what your online presence is offering the other question about where where is your community so where are your people are they all on Instagram are they all on Facebook are they on Twitter so you know you that 's where you want to spend your time right yeah exactly so there 's a few things that you talked about like the questions that you ask yourself about what you like to share in your online presence and I think that 's there they 're sort of slightly deeper they 're not like I need one photo of myself one photo of my work one foot you know like those sorts of things more to do we like tasks and stress you know then that sort of deeper you know what the core values of your business are and then sort of move yeah strategies and then moving up to tasks from there so yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on our podcast and in the work that I do with clients trying to develop strategies and make these decisions for their business so usually I work with with very lean businesses so there one person who 's an artist or there are a very small team and you know and they 've got very limited resources and very limited time and I think that 's probably most people here so I think it 's really important before you put your valuable time and resources into a project like maintaining a social media platform like investing in a website you need to ask really important questions so basically you know what does your online presence need to do for you what story does it need to tell those are the fundamental ones so this might be like does your website need do you need a website to detail the services that you offer do you need to show that you 're an expert in your field and is a website the best vehicle for those four to tell that story and then there 's a practical layer which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to fulfill online like do you need to sell something you need ecommerce do you need that ability do you offer a product you need to show that product and and you know reveal details about it do you offer a service do you offer packages do you like basically what makes you money and what supports your practice your creative practice so maybe you make most do money at like market stalls and how can you tell a story of what that experience is like and how can you best connect to people who might visit that I mean it 's a bit that example a bit irrelevant at the moment maybe yeah and then there 's questions about what what your story is or your why so why do you create what drives your creative practice what has your journey be like what what kind of process have you gone through to get to the point now where you 're offering this product or service or creating this type of work and so I think they 're all important questions yeah that 's something that we talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are constantly asking you about what is it that people you know what are you an expert in and what is it that you can share and a lot of the online present stuff I think does come back to that sense of values and what your what you can present with integrity I 'm I 'm seeing these questions come through and I feel like you know not in quite a lot because I like mckaela and noggin totally hearing what both of you are saying we 'll get to the questions in a minute because I 've got plenty to say on those and we 'll just quickly just a quick run through some you know because we did say that we 're going to talk about a few tips and tricks yeah there 's just a few questions that people often ask and that I personally have also in the past struggled with with on my online presence and things like do you have to post every day every week three times a day how you know do is there like a magic number and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you recycle anything okay so easy to answer these basically you need to pick your mat your own magic number for what you can maintain because the key with with telling a story and building a community on so let 's say for example Instagram is it 's basically consistency there 's no point in posting every day if someone you can 't keep that up so you 'll go for a week and then you 'll go for a long stretching you won 't post at all I mean that just that 's just not the best way to approach it and number two if if that content is not really going to be valuable to your audience so if you 're posting every day but it 's like a one-word caption and it 's not really engaging with people um then I would suggest you know post every three days or or twice a week or something like that but really put some time into thinking about how best to connect with people with those people that you want to start a conversation with it makes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas so basically no I honestly I think you want to it comes back to consistency a little bit in this area like you want to create you want to invite people into your world so you want to create you want to tell this story and sort of an in a consistent way so I would say choose a kind of like choose a kind of color theme and what a certain way that you present your world and try to keep that consistent but using the same sorts of images images of the same subject like for example you know the story that that I want to tell what I talk about a lot on my social media is basically the fact that I work from my kitchen table you know and I 've got lots of pictures of me working at my kitchen table and people really connect with that and that 's that is how I promise you I 'm at my kitchen table right now that 's how I run my business people connect with that because they see that that 's a that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about mindset I talk about challenges that I face about balancing family and work you know those are all conversations that people in my community want to have and people respond to and so I guess my short answer there would be variations on a theme so if you find something that people are really connecting with keep kind of like keep kind of trying to interrogate you know that that conversation or that issue or that that image that people are connecting with and and from various angles what do you what do you when you 're talking about that so that 's sort of similar with the greens pool thing for me because it 's something that season or but it also like I can take a photo of that same place and it 's totally fine that I took a photo of it prior and then reuse or not necessarily using images but using that same place but then I can look at the talk about other much more you know I 'm not just talking about the weather I 'm saying ah it 's sunny today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of a jumping-off point to talk about you know something that is of real interest to me and feels like a bit more of a conversation and stuff like that so I think that yeah the other thing is that you can recycle like we 're 100% environmentally friendly at sole traders podcast so it 's like recycle your content there 's no people you you know as if I would say I would say rather than recycle just come up yeah come up here it says you know really social media Facebook Instagram do you duplicate use the same content so I would say repurpose it 's always good to show up in that space so say if you 've got kind of a conversation that you want to have and you put something out on Instagram instead of just you know choosing the options just kind of like pollinate that across Facebook and Twitter I would go into Facebook and put similar content but slightly you know slightly more matched and cater to that that space and I would spend that time in that space posting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works where the algorithm works is that they favor engagement and activity within that app because they want you to stay in that act like that 's how it works and you 'll find you get more engagement if you spend that time posting within that space basically and and linking and using the correct hashtags and stuff like that but in terms of content it can be the same thing but it 's just slightly repurposed for that platform so just Bridget 's got a question that we can answer pretty quickly which is do you think it 's important to have images of yourself and your face as well as images of your work I already know yeah he 's answered what is the question Amy yeah boy we get asked this a lot don 't we and it 's a really tricky one I think for creatives for artists who are used to learning their work speak for them and then not necessarily I mean performers might be an exception to these or dances but most creative people aren 't used to putting their face and themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in creative disciplines as well we 're not great self-promoters a lot of us it 's true you know but but face out there they said do you know what I so I did this exercise with my sister she 's an author so she writes books novels and she 's very much a kind of reserved in the background kind of person and she just refused to accept what I was saying which is that you need people interested in seeing you they want to connect with you you are writing these books there 's a lot of kind of themes that come from your own life in your work people want to see your face like literally your face and if you don 't believe me go into your Instagram insights and look at the content that people that gets the highest engagement and the top nine ones I guarantee you if you 've ever put images of yourself those images will be in that top line and my sister went in June is who 's right and you know it 's painful but and maybe like buh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to being behind the camera rather than in front of it can you give any tips about how to get around that discomfort of showing up in your things look I think you just gotta I would say suck it up that 's what I say to people that I 'm also photographing I 'm not like you 're really sort of like oh yeah I 'm like it 's not about you in a sense like it feels like the photos are about you because they 're of you but actually it 's not a about you at all it 's about people being able to put a face to a name being able to have a bit more of a personable connection with youth because when you 're in social media it 's you 're already distanced in the digital sort of sense yeah you know and it doesn 't mean I mean I 've got to say I don 't love Instagram feeds where it 's just the person 's face constantly and they 're just you know and then a quote and then their face again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think if it 's got but it 's all about the story you 're trying to tell right so you know what is that person doing are they just doing this kind of selfies or whatever cuz that 's really boring you know like if you 're a photographer are you these images are you working of you setting up a scene of you behind the camera of you talking to a client you know if you 're making ceramics I like is this you and your studio what 's on your wall how do you work what are you wear what do you listen to you know like what your hands look like at the end of a session well you know really people want to see that okay I 'm interested in that do you guys want to see my daily fingernails no um hey Amy can we just scroll back because there 's a cup there was a couple of good juicy questions earlier oh you know numb and Vaughn do you have any suggestions for questions that came up yeah I 'll I 'll just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back dating thing and like so the scrolling back in the archive stuff is it better to own the journey that you 've been on which is that it was all really disparate in who knows or do you think that it 's good to get rid of the outdated and anything that 's off-brand what do you reckon Amy I would say don 't edit everybody 's come from somewhere just decide on a very clear story strategy for building a community and move forward and you know everyone 's like scroll back on any like really nice really beautiful account on Facebook Instagram and you will see you know you will see like that it had a messy kind of unclear beginning I think just move forward because you 're spending time in the past and these platforms move so quickly that you just need to be focused on the story you need to tell in the moment what 's happening now what 's happening next week it 's it 's its current and future that 's what I think what do you think though yeah look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something there that you think might be that you particular image that you feel like is Exim for some reason if it 's an ex-partner or it 's a something one of your kids or you know something personal that you just don 't really want to still have on your social media otherwise I would just keep moving on if nobody really Scrolls that far back most people land on your landing page they might look at you know in that grid of however many you know if there 's maybe 15 or something they might look at two or three maybe that jump out at them in that first 15 points other than that no one 's going to really look so I would just not worry about it because it and it does I mean any when you say off-brand I mean the main other thing is that you know having consistency across the platforms if you 're using multiple platforms but also you know in terms of the past no one is really scrolling that far back and I 'll give you grace as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I would say on that topic is that social media is a great place to experiment so if you try something for a while you know and and it goes really well right you can continue in that way if it doesn 't like for a while I was thinking ah you know generally I don 't think text belongs on Instagram but given that I am one of the things I do is is content riding maybe I should put some quotes on there I tried that for a while I was like oh I just don 't like the way it looks and I don 't think people are really connecting with it so I stopped and I mean those are still there and I still you know that 's fine like I think I think it 's a great place a great forum to and and to test things out and I think there 's a lot of people will give you grace to try things out I think that 's fine I agree it 's a very people are very friendly overall in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickier party thing so I want to go to noggin this question earlier which was I feel like a website 's important for personal control and ownership of my content we put an enormous amount of effort into producing the images and then Facebook Instagram let 's see these platforms own that content they can shut it down at their own win so look i yeah i 'm really also aware of that and i think all of the images that I have on you know you have to accept that when you especially as a photographer you want to market yourself you need to put your images out there so you can do things to minimize the way that they can be reused that 's usually to do with sizing I don 't use watermarks I find them that they look clunky but other people do this is also a little bit of a I think an inroad into the idea of things like email lists like having your own email list as opposed Oh if Instagram were to in fact which now Facebook and Instagram are one entity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people if they fall over tomorrow where are how are you going to contact and reconnect with your community and when I say community that includes your clients it includes your customers it includes your colleagues that 's a lot of C 's yeah it 's that 's your community so something like an email list and building an email this is really central and it 's it 's very independently so for you noggin it might be that that is a way of having independent connection with those with all of those people and the reality you know I agree with you saying you despise Facebook I 'm not a huge Facebook user either but I do a lot of people who I 'm not on Instagram with are on Facebook so I still keep my Facebook page open but I 'm not you know not there all the time enjoying it in the same way that I enjoy and happily interact it is not a chore to interact on Instagram ami social media duplication of the same content or I think we 've answered that one yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh yeah okay ah do you need your all your products sort of all sorted if you 're selling something before you start selling that 's a good question actually what are you okay this is a great question I might read it out and if you 're selling something do you think it 's important to have all your selling ducks lined up before introducing yourself to the market on Instagram like having your Etsy shop setup pricing sorted etc this is really easy to answer no there 's no there 's no time like now on social media things are moving so fast there 's no better time to start telling your story then right now who are you what drives you to make what are you selling what are the story behind that where do you source your materials from and bring people along for the journey you know like are you having difficulty deciding which products to put up online first or which postal service to use or which like compostable packaging to use then you can ask people what they want I 'm not joking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no better time to start building your community and connecting with people then right now and that 's not encouraging words by 140 Amy 's going you 're going to be in trouble yeah I think that 's the other thing like I think that becomes a question of you know treating it a bit more like an experiment so everything doesn 't have to be all sorted on the back end before you can put it out there on social media it 's very different to this idea of opening a shop or having products ready it 's it 's even if you only have one product and you 've you know so this is from Kathy so maybe this was about the pottery thing you only have one thing to sell take lots of photos of it turn it into an experiment like how deep can you go with that one product and how many things can you garner out of it the making what 's you know the your Soria yeah so a good friend of mine sim Simone from winter wears is a great account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Bowl and you know that Bowl had a name and the whole story behind that Bowl that she took told very successfully on her Instagram account was you know that she that she couldn 't find a bowl like this out there you know this organic shape this sort of like the dimensions of it and she went it she 's decided she was gonna create this bowl because it frustrated her that she couldn 't find it and she documented this whole kind of experimenting making molds you know trying to trying and failing to to make this bowl and it was fascinating and you know that people connect with that so I bring people along with a journey it really humanizes your products in the end just the same as showing your face does I would also say because I know that we 're just about to wrap up it 's very much about having a go with social media you can make a mistake and it 's totally fine if it 's a real disaster you can delete it and if it 's not a disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it and so I think that 's I think if you if you step into it more like an experiment then a sort of sense of you know that there 's so much riding on it you know keep it light for yourself because it 's hard also there can be a lot of comparison itis especially when you 're working in a space where you know people who have been doing it for many years or you know and you 're showing up there is something you might nervous about yeah you 've got a very different starting line so you know don 't be hard on yourself and give everything a go and give everything a try that 's what I would say I 'm also I 'm a recovering perfectionist though I don 't know if you know that but I think it 's a great oh well at it it 's a great way to kind of it 's a great mindset to be in that experimenting like you know I 'm not putting this out because it 's finished and it 's perfect it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to see what happens what kind of feedback am I gonna get are people going to respond to it how are they gonna respond and then I 'll learn something and then that will inform you know the conversations that I have in the future I reckon that 's a great way to end this zone because also it was an experiment for us too and we had no idea how well it was gonna go or whatever so you know so much of vine I just want to say let everyone know that if you have questions for us you can for next week which is going the topic is going to be marketing and community building for creatives and that is very juicy that 'll be really fun yeah very excited about that one so if you have some questions you can email ovando at Melwood she 'll it 'll tire she 'll type it into the little type e thing with questions or you can ask questions through the Facebook page yeah we love questions because that helps us to make this really useful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where are you so yeah do the questions through also if you haven 't you might also like if you enjoyed this type of stuff when you haven 't listened to the podcast yet you might want to listen to the Instagram and originality yes episode sharing I guess some of the stuff that we talked about today and yeah thank you so much for joining in it 's been really good it 's hopefully going off without a hitch and hopefully everyone has been able to have their questions answered and thanks so much for participating much appreciated so thanks a lot and

departments within the city for action so all our work is done on our iPads now there are a number of myths when it comes to security officers and their duties we may be you know filling out our KPIs we may be reporting graffiti we may be reporting other incidents or even a job we may have attended st. just recently we would go to a more private area perhaps and complete the report in detail this

property value the speed humps and speed cushions and platters they 're actually only installed when the drivers are actually traveling too fast and there 's too many of them so there 's a hierarchy of roads where we try to encourage main roads try to encourage the majority of vehicles on say Canyon Highway leach Highway South Street there there higher level roads we don 't want a lot of traffic to be right running down and past people 's houses this is where people live speed humps are actually used to slow vehicles down and it also encourages them onto the roads that they should be traveling on rather than front of people 's homes why doesn 't the city get rid of the CSS and use that money to install CCTV instead all right CSS CCTV CSS as a service and does a variety of tasks not only observe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than generating voluntary compliance it gathers the information it deals with maintenance issues it assists people 's it deals with lock ups alarms and locks and they go everywhere we can go whatever you request CCTV as itself it 's a tool it 's it 's it 's it 's one of the tools you can have in your toolbox of trying to reduce crime but also you got a test are considering okay there 's a cost associated with installing CCTV where we 're going to put that CCTV it 's a CCTV gonna be effective it has to be certain quality is the lighting efficient and who 's gonna be reviewing that footage are we gonna wearing honest or that footage who 's gonna be actually responding to the footage as a CC do this number of studies down that CCTV is a tool to help you

@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the details where they are how many of them are they the good thing about our service is that when we arrive we usually arrive within 10 minutes so we can actually ascertain the

there in a short period of time and we act appropriately why did bike riders ride on the road when there is a perfectly good path to Jason to the road so we 've got bike riders who travel 20 or 30 kilometers each way to work each day we 've got other bike riders who are four years old and they 're actually just learning method starting the process of like right and then there 's everybody in between so when we actually have a look at the facilities we provide for bike riders everybody means different facilities so if you find a like reclined bike ride around in 20 kilometers I need to travel on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's people pushing prams there 's people walking dogs going across that the path we 've got people learning how to ride skateboarders and roller bladers and things like that so for me to travel 20 kilometers in any reasonable amount of time I actually need to to be on the road and I need to behave as a vehicle on the road and they 're legally allowed to ride on the road see a lot of people don 't realize that they can write two abreast on the road with one and a half metres between them taking the lane one of the reasons they do that is because if they don 't take the lane drivers try to squeeze past pass median islands and it 's incredibly dangerous for them why do you ask on my details when I call I want to be anonymous okay so a we need to establish the

strategically located around our existing commercial centers and generally around our major transport routes that so that we make the best efficiency of existing infrastructure and resources and also from an economic point of view it creates local customers for local businesses so that 's generally our focus for putting most of our high-density in those areas I think there 's a been a growing recognition in recent years of the role of local government in supporting their business community as well as their residential community so for me that involves supporting existing businesses to attract more customers to attract more investment into the area Resort and to just prepare urban Phillips or AcuRite urban environments are very conducive to successful businesses so that 's not

challenging for all communities however it 's a necessity given the planning planning framework that the city and the state has undertaken particular over the last 10 to 15 years and we 've got prime

not just serving the needs of developers profit and speculators home councils run by people with business interests they want to promote they focus on individuals in terms of councillors is one that individuals have to take responsibility for when they nominate to be a counsellor and they 're required to obviously make declarations about their own personal interest somewhere they 've got a conflict they obviously declare that in a council form so it 's not a case of actually saying it 's just in the councillors are out to feather their own nest certainly the way that it operates is to for the greater good of the community if anything the business community is a bit underrepresented with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council 's represented evolved their local communities and residents so I think it could be a healthier balance to have more representation from the business community upon council I think it would help make more informed decisions around the economics of cities and I guess

that have business interests and local local business retailers wanting the best out of their their area so they have that local expertise that Tom 's speaking about and that 's really really valuable for the council to have that on board the local governments have a part to play in supporting growth and prosperity absolutely local government is basically the grassroots of society in the sense that we deliver all the base services to the community and very much their case of having an important role in relation to that it obviously extends to relationships with the state government and possibly even the federal government at a political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the community and delivering is definitely very important I think it is that more localised role it 's that opportunity to to know your local business owner in your local resident that voice that we have from the community they can be our best asset to know what 's happening out there and how we can respond and serve them in the best way possible don 't governments have to give business incentives to get them to buy I don 't think so I mean there are some of the government 's who offer grants and some sort of incentives programs such as it 's a waiver and alfresco fees for a certain period of time but they 're generally things you do I would recommend in kind of circumstances where you want to accelerate a particular change but I think the role of local government is not around trying to subsidize local businesses or businesses to set up in a space but to create the right and dry climate and the right sustainable environment for businesses to be successful we 're often that bear the brunt of frustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaining about fences however we readily deal with these issues but one of the key aspects is to focus on that council 's really do aim to try and facilitate the outcomes we don 't try to create red tape yes if I 'm working on recently is promoting the opportunities for food vans to operate in the city some of our local reserves and places where they really complement the recreational users that are on and again that 's all about making it easier for local businesses to operate in these areas provides amenity to the community users and opportunities for those local businesses yeah that 's just one of the things that we 're doing at the moment"

    "text": "good morning everyone and it won 't hear me all right excellent I like to welcome you and thank you very much we can introduce you to Fogo versus food organics and garden organics we live in a Western Australia in particular has a very sandy inlining soil base compost is the best thing for it to keep your plants if Gardens empty going growing where it 's really well that 's part of the idea here we want to try producing high quality compost get it out of the waste stream and not buried in the ground that 's that 's basically the field and all right a lot of welcome we have Esther here from the city of Melville she 's our West education officer we have coming here for the SMR see she is what we referred to as a jack-of-all-trades she is our waste Education Officer she has our Communications Officer she 's our marketing officer and an all-around really good help for us and we have myself I 'm the manager of waste resource recovery wastes and a lot to introduce you the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human me look to your left please look to your right that is arrest the Fogo team welcome thank you okay three beers you 've only got two we 're gonna move to three we 're going to give you two brand new touch on how we 're gonna do it boy and that is the basics of food organics and garden organics a little little beam like this one down the bottom using our kitchen caddy you 'll get one of those as well and you tell your boy as we all know 50 years or so ago our waste is extremely different that the materials that we 're getting through now a lot of it was organic most of the meals were cooked and eaten at home as much as we 're taking newspaper back as often we use nothing came in for acting and the packaging and the e-waste that we have today so in those days use together steal a bit and we figured that it was okay to go to a large hole in the ground landfill even clearly this is not the way for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're creating of real issues with future generations something that has to be addressed that it really has to be addressing that so the purpose of this is to get flat on food scraps out of the landfill and into a processing system where it can be returned to the air from an environmental perspective my underpinning is I want to put back but I 've taken out it 's that simple I want to future-proof our place for future generations by simply putting back what we 've taken out P P I don 't want to grow food on chemicals I want to use organic matter I want to see the insect life that we 've killed off the sprays and stuff coming back up these are our pollinators these are what are going to help us keep alive at the future hippie so that is live or grow it isn 't okay the way I put it in little group in Spokane food organics and garden organics and it 's Paul said before out my name is Connor and I 'm with a southern metropolitan Regional Council so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do where a local government authority the process is waste for a number of councils in the southern metro area and for about the last 15 years we 've been collecting your general waste bins and putting them through our processing system to create a low-grade compost so we 're talking about getting all the organic materials that you 've been putting into your general waste bins and turning them into a compost that 's been used in agriculture so you know an organic materials have been screened out what we 're looking for with the Fogo system is having that third beam just for your organic waste so we can create a really good clean high quality compost and that gives us so many more opportunities to reuse it back in the community so I 'm just going to go through with different mini systems that you might be familiar with around Perth and how they 're different to the photo system the we 're looking up so the first one you 're obviously very familiar with so that 's your tubing system your dark great general waste bin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science and so what we 're talking about you and we have the numbers on the side in terms of diversion from landfill we 're talking about the amount of things in that entire waste stream that we can reuse so we can recover and reuse them in some way and they 're not sent to landfill so we 're looking at a standard kind of tube in the system we are looking at it you don 't waste in your recycling and also your breath ' waste and your bulk there twice and from all of that on average around Perth we can recover around 33% from where you I 'm hearing no but we can recover a bit more because we do compost organic some other councils in Perth have gone to a different kind of three-bin system which we call the geo or a garden organic system and that 's providing another bin just for your garden waste so that 's taking all your garden waste out of that general waste streams and reusing that as mulch or compost so in terms of how much we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the standard tubing system so we 're looking about 40 to 50 percent of everything from that one but what we 're looking at with the Coco system is not only having that great waste but also taking place down at the general waste stream and using entering a really good high quality compost and by doing that we 're looking at about 66 to 67 percent aversion from landfill and that 's already above the state government target for 2020 so we need just look at the stats in terms of how other people have done it and how the systems work we also didn 't a trial in the city available to see how it 's going to work for you so they in October 2017 we were in the trial across five different areas in Mobile and this was a joint project not only with normal and the SAARC but also with the City of Fremantle Undertown Bistro mantle so the areas that were chosen were representative of those three councils so we look for a range of different socio-economic areas of different dwelling types different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good idea of how this system works for a whole variety of people and it actually went really well so we had a few key performance indicators we were looking at and that was how clean was the logo that went into this so the contamination rate we 're talking about how much of that was like long photo materials so in terms of other photo systems that have rolled out they get something like eight to ten thirty termination in the past year in the first six months we only had three percent contamination so that just shows what a great day look at everyone put in to keep up in early clean to put the right stuff in and by doing that we created a really good high quality compost the met the Australian standard for an unrestricted use so we can use that back in parks and gardens around town we also have the really good diversion rate that that 's and we didn 't just look at the kind of performance of the overall system we asked the people what they thought as well so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how everything was working and asked people are they happy to continue on then we had about 90 percent response to say guess where things people which is great we also had the same time when after our wider s MRC region and said this is what 's happening the trial is this something that you would also like and we had about 75 percent of people say yes we came to try that too so after all those results there was a commitment not only noble but also freeing out to what Andes from mantle to roll the system out on the lights go right there with a little movie that shows you gets a no foe go we are moving to a three bin food organics garden organics photosystem households will now be able to compost recycle and reduce waste to landfill the yellow bin stays but it 's out with the old dark green bin and in with the new lime green and red beans you 'll also get a kitchen caddy and year supply of compostable liners the new bins read for general waste and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular collection day and you 'll keep your existing dela recycling bin your old dark green bin will be removed the day after your new vintage dropped off and taken away to be recycled or reused so put it out and leave it out so just to recap during the rollout period from July to September continue to put your bins out on your regular collection day your new red and lime green bins will be dropped off along with your kitchen caddy and compostable liners when you get your new bins be sure to leave out your old dark green bin on the verge it will be collected the next day you 'll end up with three color bins a lime green bin for food and garden organics a red bin for general waste and the yellow bin for recycling for more information please visit www.potterybarn.com [Music] the voiceover that was our wastewater did the voice over so we didn 't have to employ some fancy-pants doctor as well so did units are the trigger for when the system changes is when the system changes it 's when your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from July 8th to mid-september when those new bins arrive that 's when you leave your old read little bin out nothing will be collected the following day it 's going to be a hundred percent recycled each of these bins is at least 30% recycle bin so it 's a valuable commodity something we really need to get back so that we can reuse or make more bins with those that are still decent well get chopped up into bits and made into movies they will be related and reused up with our residents ok so it 's a hundred percent recycling the trigger as I say for when that system changes is when your new bin to ride and that 's when you leave your old bin out of protection the following day what would you get with that you 'll get your 243 minutes per going food or mates gone up in its base you 'll get your 140 liter little red LED general waste piece and you 've still got your recycling bin so these are two newbies tips like on the back of this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about more later inside your kitchen money will be your waste calendar three magnets each of which represents what goes on the front here what 's on the front here have you been shows you what goes in stick on your fridge stick your waist pan join your boot and you can be pretty sorted there 's also the instruction booklet on how to use the systems ok oh and I needed forgot the liners we 're going to talk more about these later but you will get two rolls of liners should be enough to last a year if you 're changing them every couple of days we 'll talk a bit more about this later but the important thing with these is to keep them dry because otherwise they will compost themselves it 's one of those things okay so to go over it again you 'll reach cycling will now be collected port nything this is going to go on to a two weekly collection process we 'll talk about that more as we go through the bread lydic will also go port 90 all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that needs to be collected weekly so your lime green will go out with alternate weeks it would be either your credited general waste bin or your yellow needed recycling bin now first you 're going to think I don 't know what my bin days we will talk about that more later and also neighbors are very useful have a look down the street see one okay I don 't like it so does everyone understand what you have to do good excellent teller what is this is our roller this is how I roll out 67,000 feelings okay big job does slightly kick me up somewhat some night every night especially Monday but that we 've done before Connor was here for the original trial so was I and as we stated before the average contamination rate for a Fargo rollout Plus and I 'm going to go service and reached was around 8% I was about 10% of the very start of the rather and lo and behold the lovely residents of Melville we managed to maintain fate some three percent which was not only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was fantastic I 'm not gonna lie I did have a wager on with my friends and I lost a considerable amount of beer over that one side will not lose faith in the city of mobile residence ever again it was all up to them they did a fantastic job sorry how you do it to recap one week you 're gonna put these two out okay you ready agree next week please do Halle Berry since October 2017 so how we 've done it for Monday one for example Monday the 8 D Day is when we start rolling that bins out this area and if you notice it flows all nicely through each area so for Wednesday for example it flows this way again so the people in areas 1 2 could look out the window and see the existing foger berries and go do this one this one okay try to make it as simple as possible that 's going to take us ten weeks inside your caddy we 've got a calendar if you do get stuck the refer to that and inside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out what bit okay whether it be yellow one or what weeks you red one as well or you can get on a technical savvy I 'm I 'm learning the top up here is find you 've been this is a widget that 's on the city of Melbourne webpage you can jump on there you type in your address it 'll show you again what week to put your yellow one out what week to put your red one out it will tell you when your green waste collections are coming up all three of them it 'll tell you when your birds waste that 's coming up as well and give you all the all the awesome information you need about waste and recycling for the city okay it will also tell you when your bins will be delivered okay please don 't hold me to task if we do have a little slight delay don 't wring efforts if I promise you it 'll come on Monday 19 I 'm putting on several get at you on Monday okay we might have some issues we haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I don 't need this we 're going to have any problems but if you do get stuck jump online and all the info will be there for you so we should finish around the 14th of September so no offense to anyone living in applecross I didn 't put you up there last or anything like that it 's just how we did the rollout through here and we 'll touch on some more questions about this one little bit later not everyone 's going to Fargo okay these are gonna this is going to be our standard collection service for then choose okay that 's it we 're here to help so you do get stuck pick up the phone and give us a call but the ones that aren 't going to the businesses at the moment we 're going to concentrate on my priority which is the resonance here we 're going to get the system right out to you getting a set it in once everyone gets gets a head around it it keeps rolling forward we 'll look at the businesses they generate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it in the hole in the ground we want that back okay the next ones will be the ones in multi-use dwellings okay if you 're in a 8 10 20 unit complex and you have your own beans you 'll get further if you live in our 8 10 20 unit complex and you share your beans I you don 't have a bin for each unit you 're not going to go to photo just yet okay we 'll get you it requires a bit more specific education will be doing door-knocking you 'll get to make a drink unfortunately you 'll probably get me or if you 're lucky you 'll get ester I 'll come on and we 'll come round and we 'll educate we 'll teach you how to use a service without because it needs a bit hard cuz you 're sharing fees but you 're going to a fortnightly collection again those in the multi uses that are sharing bins if you do get stuck walk outside have a look left and right and you 'll notice there but you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well kitchen getting this is cool on the back of your photo bin will be one of these this one here is dishwasher safe you can chuck it in a few dishes you can clean it up you can put it your dishwasher inside of this will have two drawers of 75 compostable liners compostable liners only in these ones please these are free all right if you do run out our bags our libraries and community centers will have these on stock you just have to run out there show you some proof of residency and pick these bags up we say proof of residency because we are rolling out with free mail on these free mail and I want to make sure the bags go to our residents all right so this one 's really easy to peel the liner off stick it in here in here is everything in your kitchen that that 's grown it 's grown food scraps you meat fish anything for it pinches the whole lot this is a little bit different compost system then if you have a worm farm or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your make your bones and you see food never eaten those ones this one you can we 'll get rid of that for you would turn into high quality compost basically what we found coming out of our our trucks the end of the day after we pick up the beans is is accredited compost so good job right what I do I 've got wife two kids 42 kilo dog I still generate try and egg healthy and I don 't look at but I try and eat healthy I go through every two to three days I need to change my liner in this one so all I do is just undo it 's got lovely handles here tie it off drop it straight if I go be or I get started I 'll put my newspaper down the bottom or if I cook tops for example I put the chops on our ABS or paper I put that into and everything on top of it look hot water and hot liquids like if you don 't squeeze your teabag out that will chew through these fairly quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tea which I do as well I just make sure there 's some actual paper some newspaper down the bottom for I throw it in there all right that 's about it one hand your cross two of the economy yes I guess because I was covered most of what can go in your penny so just to recap so all your leftovers so either raw or cooked the food preps top bones Sheldon the seafood if you do find that you have things that are a odorous like your seafood shelves or bones and you 've still got a couple of days before collection and you put those in your compostable liner or in the newspaper and just keep them in the freezer until bin date and then just take them out on rocket 14 gets collected just so they 're not sitting there on the curb breathing dairy so that 's a good new for people who like composter home so anything kind of not too much liquid but things like our yogurt or solid dairy can go in there as well shredded paper is something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recycling because we can 't really capture that in recycling but paper is a really good component of the composting process as well so any kind of shredded paper can go either you can go straight to the photo be our tissue use a paper towel so any of your kitchen towel that you 're using while you 're cooking we can go and you can either help soak up the liquid or you just put that your finger in as well okay so why are we asking you to use the compostable liners so the difference between these and a normal plastic bag is that these lately made from corn starch so they 're collecting natural product they will act exactly the same as other organic matter in the composting system so they will break down completely if you 're looking at plastic bags even if they claim that they 're biodegradable also biodegradable they will break down but they 'll break down into very small pieces of plastic and that will remain in the compost and that is still gonna mean contaminant in our compost so don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags at shops which say they are no biodegradable or compostable what we 're looking for is that certified compostable logo that we 've had up before which is on all on the bags so that 's why we encourage you just to use the bags and the supply through the council and as Paul said if you do run out of those quicker than you expect we can 't come with you come on okay so what else goes in your food it in so all your food organics have kind of gone through all your garden organics so pretty much anything from your garden your clippings your pruning your weeds some people have been a bit concerned about putting words in but through the composting process all the seeds are killed off so it doesn 't no problem with putting words in there also your dog poo and kitty litter can go in here as well so what we asked with that is just to either be wrapped in newspaper for kitty litter or a compostable bag the same as dog food it can all go in loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts around them switch to the compostable dog bags and I think in the future we will be rolling out more of those as well so if you 're looking at the bags in the park just have a look for the impossible like I want them as well so really this one is anything as we said before anything that lived or grew you can go in here you can also put some of your excess paper and cardboard in this one as well if you 've got anything shredded anything that 's too small for recycling as long as it 's going to break down in the compost existed and count so put it in the folk open okay I 'm gonna have a quick review of the recycling process you probably all know this but the simplest way to look at your recycling bin when it comes to plastics is will it pass the squeeze test if I squeeze it and it comes back to its shape without shattering into a thousand pieces like while staring would just pops back even those biscuit liners you know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sorting to be able to capture them they have to have a 3d shape they have to be what we call a Gris cheap plastic if it goes flat like plastic bag and behaves like paper when it 's not paper then it 's going to go into the red bin okay so like glad wrap and cling film yes it pops back and people say to me but it is coming back but it 's not it 's coming back flat it 's coming back so if there 's any fracture on it at all it will not hold a shape okay and it will just get caught up he 'll pack I hate white paper when it 's not paper it 'll get caught up in the paper stream and contaminate around this cannot go in your recycling bin there are some people who still think they 're doing the right thing by putting their recyclables into a plastic bag or beautiful and clean and it goes straight to landfill it 's it has it we can 't open it you can 't have it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to open it and it 's also very dangerous could it might be general rubbish you could have something awful and they like sharps or whatever so plastic bottles and containers yes not tetra Paks hand up if you know what a tetra pack is okay attach the back is one of those it 's got cardboard on the outside so it looks like it should be recyclable but inside it will have a liner now that liner Megan foil liner or foil a white liner and is plastic the system cannot separate it will just go in and again the paper stream so we cannot have those texts back so you 're looking at things like soy milk almond milk long life milk the stuff that tends to be not so much in the rich department of the supermarket but out on a shelf because they 're trying to make that dairy type material last as long as possible so they line it with that to keep it as fresh as possible that 's not going your yellow bit however if it 's just what they called liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in then that 's fine too going with all these things they need to be clean and dry but it 's not a huge amount of cleanliness you 're not going to eat off the thing again it just needs to be clean enough so it doesn 't contaminate the system or sitting out there in the middle and some of the two weeks get pretty smelly and nasty the other thing that the plastic pots and things these niche need to come up and that 's basically for the same reason even if I wash it out put it on the side if I put the lead back on and leave that for two weeks in the summer heat what 's going to happen to any materials down the block and when it goes into the trap guess what it gets compacted lid pops off materials come out don 't wall open contaminate the paper so it 's got to be reasonably clean and dry you don 't have to go over the top having said that of course I got my recycles the dishwasher but then I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to be reasonably clean okay even if like tuna cans and things like that so it would spend ages trying to rinse the thing out they just give it away with a piece of kitchen towel get your towel from going in BOGO be perfect to degrade that good to be composting tin can go through yeoman okay so it doesn 't have to be immaculate but it does need complete and as dry as possible same with oil bottles turn them upside down let them drain out as much as and then it 's going to the recycle bin what else we 've got here we 've got anything that I wanted to get to talk about aluminium is recyclable so long as it 's clean and dry it 's that same thing it 's clean and dry if you can wrap it into a pitch size ball then it 'll get caught by what they call an eddy stream which is an electronic stream that goes across the runway it hits that it jumps into exactly the right place hands up if you have you ever clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've done brilliant tools it 's great thing you can actually see how the process works and why it is that we do what we do so that might be something that kind of construction or about beta why am I not going to see many of these and it 's not because of the time that three hard sorry them sorry brother why we 're not going to see many of these going my recycling bin next is really fun we got the refund finally it 's coming in and it 's going to be not like New South Wales one which is highly restricted it 's going to be a whole huge range of recyclables that can go into the ten cent deposit so hopefully our charities and our sporting clubs and all these will be able to actually start to take these back in yeah fund themselves with it so yeah those have probably be coming out but if they can 't come out clean drying in the recycling bin [Music] another question we have coming up the other day metal it 's absolutely fine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as for the plastic needs I said take them off but I couldn 't tell you what to do with them they go into the general rubbing hurts me because they are a recyclable product we 'll talk about that a bit more in a moment but they 're too small for the system that just called ghrelin up landfill anyway outside of the curbside system there are many other collections many other types of collections there 's a fellow here that takes these back and mounts them down and uses a 3d printer to produce artificial limbs so there 's collections going on that 's outside of the curbside system that up fantastic I think it was rotary wasn 't it yeah rotary was connecting me so that 's a brilliant out for that one what else we got in there I feel that the old flat classical 's glass here gets ground down used as Road basics all glass can go in there even if it 's broken even if it 's a drinking glass or window glass absolutely put it in your yellow bin"

eventually took with regard to the extension rural highway under the power freight link on the tunnel option and so why did the say support row wait and why does it support a tunnel option my presentation today a walk touch on the meta point regional scheme and also the metabolic ring road system the growth of the port road safety traffic congestion the limitations of the common route and impacts on residents and businesses body us to the increased rate on rail the EPA approvals 408 and certainly some points regarding the over-harbour mar 2 32 how do you apologize in advance that some of the that I will be according to have already be mentioned by both ministers this morning and we 've had that certainly as far as the Metropolitan ring road system it was frost gazetted back in 1963 but its origins can be traced back to nineteen fifty-five with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the note preferred alignment for the perf threat link for Shauna 's major regional highways back in nineteen fifty-five and a simplest thing to note the leech highway at that time was shown as an important regional road but certainly not a highway and as we 've held that since the deletion of the female eastern bypass part in 2004 from the mrs what we have seen no as leech highway become the default path freight link to the port when we consider Fremantle port and the growth and as we 've held currently processing around seven hundred and forty thousand teus and has the potential and to projected processing of about 1.4 million teus by 2027 and again as we 've had eighty-five percent of those teus are currently transported by Road and 15 or 14 point two percent by rail and as we 've heard from the minister there is an aspirational target to get thirty percent of those unreal at present there was approximately two thousand six hundred trucks accessing Fremont report when I early business and all that 2300 of those are using the existing route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor increases capacity we will see a doubling of vehicles as we 've heard already we do know that the city of free model itself wishes to retain the inner harbor and operating port and Fremantle port will continue to operate if and when another hard work is constructed when we look at broad safety this is a significant issue certainly for the city and I 'm the stake heavy vehicles on urban roots on the averaging seven percent on Auburn routes across the metropolitan area on leech highway is 11.5 percent the crash rates on Auburn roots involving trucks is five point four percent on leech highway it 's double up 11.1 percent of accidents involving trucks what is absolutely staggering is that target jumps the thirty one percent when we consider the intersection of canara freeway andrew highway and all of those crushes seventy two percent of them re rained crushes and that 's caused by the stop-start nature of trucks traffic lights and intersections and the weaving and merging so this is a significant issue as far as the city is concerned that something that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be a 75 percent increase of trucks using leach highway to access the port and by 2031 110 percent increase so more than double the amount of trucks that we see on that route today and as far as the city is concerned a dedicated free-flowing route to the port is essential this chart shows the ongoing demand for the inner harbor I believe it has been updated recently but what this is showing and we can see here that when and if the outer harbour does come on line we can see there 's still a growth the inner harbor so as I said a doubling of trucks in the next 20 years and when we look at traffic congestion another serious consideration that we 've held this morning there is real and we know that anyone who travels along with Nana freeware in am or PM peak period or experience level F of our level of service that set main roads which means demand exceeds the capacity of that network what we 're about the same as we 've had the population growth 3 million in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeen percent increase in vehicle registrations from 2009 to 2014 and that 's set to increase in our fifty percent by 2020 and we 'll see 3.1 million vehicles on the road network the power freight link and certainly the tunnel option that the city is proposing will take approximately two thousand trucks a day off of each highway and as we found by 2021 that will be 5,000 heavy vehicles off of the southern metropolitan road network this is also has a positive benefit and affluent effect for the vehicles per day on beach highway and south street where we 'll see a potential reduction of over 20,000 vehicles they on those roads and there are similar future reductions on beeler dr russell road rowley road and angkatell road to the south in the city at corbin and there will be significant and substantial reductions on filing and broad phoenix road north lake road and build a drive so this is a real positive for the entire southwest region not just the CML limitations of the country leach highway was never designed to function as a free trip there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from private properties that are main sets of traffic lights in the distance of each calamos and six of those are between conan fe we 're northlake Lord and that distance is only 3.5 kilometers they 're more than 20 of road junctions on the current route without traffic lights and there 's 28 bus stops on the current route and only two of those boss saath-7 Beeman 's there are low bosses to pull off the main road and that and again causes problems at the start and the stop-start nature and weaving and during those periods based on that traffic mix and the volumes we see is quite clear that leach highway and heisley would not comply with the current road design standards and operating best practice it 's simply not sustainable as a freight room and the pair freight link effectively provides as far as the city is concerned a southern bypass for the city of Melville and northern by for the city of Corbin on an eastern bypass for the city of Fremantle the potential impact on the businesses owned the residents here in the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of free model is real the proposed route has 72 properties affected of that 46 residential properties I 'm 26 commercial properties and that impact is varies from fool acquisition to simple access problems for accessing any of those facility any of those businesses on stock fraud there are significant implications for the businesses on stock road there 's a potential that 500 jobs could be lost and certainly when we talk to the businesses in that area they believe that the compensation claim for this could be as much as four hundred million dollars that our body has the increased freight on rail as we 've helped that aspirational target of thirty percent is a challenge the and as we held 14.2 percent currently on rail at the moment and that is eight trains a day accessing Fremantle port solve simple maths Filippo st. 16 trains need to access the port however there are somebody else and so much that currently the freight line also shares the passenger rail line and their passenger rail line has priority at peak times so from six a.m. to nine a.m. in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would possibly need to be a duplication of the the freight bridge over the Swan River to allow increased oil and only part of the metropolitan area is serviced by real so we know that road will continue to be a dominant factor in this movement of freight the other issue is real is not cost competitive on short-haul but also terminal course and a whole bunch of things that need to be considered and it 's simply not that 's cost-effective I would there is a subsidy in place for TEUs on rail a 15.5 million over five years and I believe that that subsidy will be reviewed in 2017 and obviously that is seen as a key factor and continuing to see more Freight on rail rude is highly competitive unadoptable we 've just held obviously from Singapore experience it 's more efficient and it will remain dominant and as we said seventy percent if we do chief thirty percent will slowly by rail by board and community acceptances and I think the photograph their shows that how close residential properties are to the current rail line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling through that area would need to consider the impact on the local community grow highway and stock road or ro8 as we 're aware there has been extensive consultation and award-winning consultation by main roads over the last few years and as a result of that there was an alternative alignment identified which as we 've held will follow the power line alignment and reduce the impact on the wetland areas this project has its state EPA approvals and as a wheat and ministerial approval from the federal government and were hopefully that will be imminent during that EPA approvals process main roads were commended for their approach and to protect environmental values of this area and they had set a new standard for projects in this sense of type of environment the other thing that certainly the city is concerned about is that access to the mod lock activity center and fremantle sorry I 'm the Fiana Stanley Hospital precinct we 've have that 35,000 people will ultimately be moving in and out of that precinct today and the southern connection to that precinct is absolutely essential for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this precinct when we talk about the other harbor on latitude 32 it 's seen as the panacea the question I would ask but is it really estimated across the five billion dollars when we consider the extensions of tonkin highway anka tell road latitude 32 intermodal complex and all the line based infrastructure that will be needed to support that port and as we have from the minister this morning potentially ten years in the making during that time Fremont report will continue to operate a capacity or up those of 1.4 million teus heavy vehicles will still be accessing the port on the root raw eat the stock rod is needed for access for both the NR and our hardware 's ultimately and certainly as far as the city as can see on the panacea is that both the path freight link with a tunnel option on yacht harbor ultimately needed so in rubbing up main conclusion there is a need for the dedicated free-flowing favorite to Fremantle port Rui on the power freight link with a tunnel will reduce congestion and improve access across the southern meadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbor harbor and certainly to the mixed-use precinct and Fiona Stanley Hospital precinct two thousand trucks they will be taken off of leech highway resulting in significant safety improvements along that route we believe that the current route is suboptimal and it was never designed to operate as a dedicated freight heavy vehicles will remain the dominant mode of transport and freight in the metropolitan area and it 's for these reasons that the city supports the extension of raw highway to stop Road under the tunnel option to Fremantle port as we believe this will achieve better outcomes for everyone involved thank you"

wanted to reiterate that i met with the prime minister 12 days ago who confirmed that the city deal the perth city deal is now worth 1.7 billion dollars for our city that 's in infrastructure and investment projects in our city which include ecu the rose street refresh which is well and truly underway the wacker overhaul which includes a 25 million one-off capital contribution to the aquatic facility from the city of perth perth concert hall refresh and the swan river pedestrian bridge you 've heard the words game changer and a very very significant landmark investment in our city 1.7 billion dollars and that investment is already underway in our city um i wanted to acknowledge also all of our staff who continue to lead by example and are coming to work on a regular basis nobody should be shocked by that statement i know but in our community it 's absolutely fabulous and i want to thank ceo michelle reynolds and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this building that those who are external and obviously not operating indoors slightly different arrangements in place but i want to thank all of our staff for leading by example and i note that in some sections of our local government community here in perth some some local governments are actually closed you can 't enter their buildings there is no one in there and clearly the example that we 're looking for is the one that 's being set here and i want to thank everybody for coming to work notwithstanding of course as we wait for more people to come back into our city with a passing if you like of the covered peaks and then hopefully restrictions and mass mandates etc we have had a terrific response to our bounce back program that 's to assist those in our community our ratepayers small business uh all sides of business uh with the recovery process and managing the covert pandemic at the moment uh as i mentioned the five thousand dollar uh quick grants that are available i met with two recipients today for example 80 from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me that she 's going to use her grant to improve her website and develop a marketing strategy for her already very successful walking tour businesses and add fantastic vibrancy to the city i note also that he said to me today we are getting bookings from people who are traveling to perth so the wheels are in motion and she 's noticed that there is certainly uh increase in appetite for people to take the tours that 's excellent also i met today from james from the heritage wine bar on st george 's terrace i think also very well known to everybody in the room are they going to use their uh grant for social media and marketing services to be able to spread the word that they 're open and they 're available and open for drinks after work or for lunch etc etc both businesses have said it 's tougher but they 're being very resourceful and they 're also showing a great deal of resilience and so i commend them so far 30 000 has been improved to 12 approved to 12 businesses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but i 'll remind everybody listening or here in the room today the grants are available you can apply for them and the period for application has been extended and it 's perth.wa.gov.a u forward slash bounce back i 'm also excited to share that soon together with the administration we 'll have details of the next phase or round of bounce back but the first round round one has been very well very well accessed and that 's terrific also as you know part of that has been a great reaction to the free nighttime parking weekend parking three three hours free in three of our best car parks and so on weekends for example three hours at pier street at his majesties and the cultural center and then free parking at night time it 's effectively free parking on the weekends in the city if you 're using one of those car parks or moving your car to an on-street bay or any of the other bays at some point so it is there to be taken advantage of can i thank our ceo and councillor bevan along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the administration who on saturday and alan where 's helen allen thank you very much alan mason uh also with us sorry ellen that i missed you um who together with members of west perth local the east perth community group activate perth and the city of perth western residents uh took a tour for our neighborhood groups uh of some of the elements of our city some of them not necessarily top of mind some of them a bit behind the scenes but to point out some of the things that are happening in our city that aren 't always immediately obvious to the public i know that there was a terrific response and it was very well received i thank those members some of whom are here tonight from our community groups for being on the trip and available and i know that from social media posts and other uh commentary around it they got a great deal out of it and that 's another sign and a further indication of our

establishments occupied by wa government departments and affiliated agencies of which we are one one final bit of news there 's been an excellent reception and reaction to the clean machine which uh launched with some uh fanfare during afl grand final week last year the anecdotal evidence and other correspondence into the city has been that people really enjoy it they like the service they contact us regularly what has become particularly evident is people like to walk up to the operator of the clean machine and say hello mate how you going there 's a bit of a mess just around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been more than happy to oblige and that is exactly what the clean machine is there for as a result of the excellent service and the excellent reception that it has had the city admin have extended the service or expanded it to include more of hay street not just the mall areas more of murray street up to milligan but also including parts of the west end of both hay and murray street wellington street up towards the perth arena or the rac arena and rose street already of course included is the city grid if you like which is from georgia 's terrace across to wellington street through uh yagan square and up james street uh complements our existing 59 dedicated cleaning staff and operates 20 hours a day seven days a week it 's been really well received it 's been very positive and certainly the community uh appreciate our efforts with the cleaning that the uh all of the staff but particularly that the clean machine is providing and very finely councillor gordon 's

so with that let 's bat on item 5.1 is public questions ceo have any public questions been received yes lord mayor questions have been received from both danielle davidson davison and mandy mcavoy in advance of the meeting all right thank you ceo so before we commence public questions i 'd like to remind everyone that this time is available for asking questions only and is not for making statements or expressing personal opinions in addition no discussion of the questions or answers is to take place so with that i 'll invite danielle davison to step forward and danielle if you could name an address please and away you go sure my name is danielle davison i live at 32 kingsville road at dale but i 'm here representing the developer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions straight one after the other or one at a time uh i think one at a time actually yeah um so is the city aware that the developer is replacing the now unfortunate tree with a replacement eucalyptus in the same location as the current tree indicating that there are no concerns over future sight lines and view lines and that the developer originally requested to replace the tree with a much bigger tree than the city staff has stipulated is preferred for reasons that we understand of allowing the replacement tree to establish over a longer period ceo um if i could pass that question on to our general manager planning and economic development thank you through you lord mayor um yes the city does understand that you wish to remove the tree and plant a replacement in approximately the same location noting it 'll be around 1.5 to 2 metres from the western boundary of the site and also in the report the city notes that the proposed replacement tree is of a size and species that the city 's arborists are satisfied will establish suitably on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city aware that there are now two independent arborist reports that note whilst the tree is alive it may present the future safety risk to the public and that but requiring the tree to stay it may create an ongoing liability and insurance risk to both the developer and the city if the tree were to fall in the future despite all best efforts to maintain it uh chairman thank you through you lord mayor so yes the city 's report on this item does note that um arborist comments were submitted and the city 's own arborists agreed with those comments that the existing tree would require extensive ongoing monitoring and maintenance and regular inspections to assess the regrowth and to evaluate its safety and amenity value going forward thanks danielle thank you very much appreciate you being here tonight i 'm going to invite mandy mcavoy to step forward now uh mandy same same arrangements apply certainly it 's maddie mcavoy 2105 delhi street west perth and firmly this is a personal question not on behalf of westperth local where i 'm on the committee there so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy of 2030 all perth and peel

organics collection trial however is there any update on the moving to fogo for residents thank you mandy yes ceo if i could invite the general manager infrastructure to respond to that question thank you through you lord mayor the city completed a food organics recovery trial at four multi-unit dwellings or muds as we call them in november of 21 to inform how fogo best works in multi-unit developments and to determine resource and education requirements a report is currently being finalized that will be coming in may of this year and based on that data collected the trial will then inform our implementation strategy and we 'd expect to implement in the next 24 months thank you alan and thank you mandy sustainability forms two goals in the draft strategic community plan in s 2.1 of the most recent community consultation the city stated quote leads by example in energy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently doing to promote waste minimization versus waste collection i 'll sit down thanks mandy uh general manager infrastructure thank you through you lord um the city offers commercial customers in particular restaurants and hotels a food organic service as part of us our city 's waste minimisation strategy in addition to this the city offers four other recycling waste streams to residential and commercial customers this includes garden organics cardboard and paper commingled recycling and our container deposit scheme collections the container deposit scheme collections occur at aberdeen street at the parking area there the facility there as well as at a reverse vending machine on rose street we 've collected over seven million containers and these have been recycled and diverted from landfill we 're also investigating at the moment moving to a waste an energy from waste solution thereby diverting the red lidded bin from landfill to com complement the move to fogo and that will then in turn achieve our targets as per the state 's waste strategy interesting to note on saturday the 21st of may the city is running two free workshops um on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eco-friendly composting system so there 's a little small little bin that does amazing things and it 's designed to be used in your kitchen or in small living spaces thank you thank you general management thank you mandy for your questions uh we 're going to move now to 5.2 deputations and ceo i believe we have some reputations tonight yes lord mayor we have received two deputations in relation to item 17.2 thanks ceo so can i remind everybody there is a five a limp five-minute limit for deputations that has not recently but um late last year changed it 's five minutes i 'm going to invite dave lee from theory for hair in west perth to come forward who is speaking for the notice of motion detailed in item 17.2 dive good evening good evening i 'm dave at the esplanade in baladura speaking for west perth and i 'm asking the city would they be willing next to extend the three-hour parking for free on saturdays on hay street and some of the side streets in west perth up till the end of hen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on saturdays there often isn 't a car parked and i wonder how much the city of perth makes out of parking in west perth and i would encourage them to make it free for three hours and encourage people to use the cat service to come in and visit the city as well as use the businesses in west part in the five minutes is steve allowed it also speak uh that 's the separate separate five minutes that 's kind of everything i had anyway but i would hope that we would be included and it would be extended to the end of hey and thomas okay dave thank you um nice to see you stay there for just a moment uh some councillors may have questions in relation to your deputation just a reminder if any councillors have questions of the admin in relation to the item please reserve them until uh this item is tabled for debate are there any questions from any councillors councillor fleeton thanks um hi dave thanks for coming in do you get this feedback direct from customers when they 're parking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feedback directly from the customers sometimes customers come in and they 're running late for their appointment to our business which we 're in the last the last shop on the street and they 'll say i don 't know where to park i thought it was free but it 's only one hour and i say give me your car okay and i drive it around the block and sometimes i drive five six seven cars and parked them on vendor street richardson terrace cook street any of the side streets that are free but they 're not all free some of them are paid parking are there any other questions from any of the councillors councillor angie thanks dave in relation to the notice of motion it states um that the extension the free parking trial so it would still be one hour free parking so is your view based on customer feedback that the free parking needs to be longer than one hour on a saturday is that insufficient on a saturday i think one hour is great but it 's not generous and it doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole city so they 'll come to a small business they might go to a cafe and have a coffee or a kebab they can 't really go to a bank now or a clothes shop because most of those in west part have closed down what i 'm trying to do is encourage three hour free parking and the use of the existing cat bus which is often empty on a saturday it 's often empty on a monday but if there was free parking on saturday people could come in it 's generous of the city of perth it might stop them going to carrying up or claremont or carousel and they 'd use the existing cat bus go into the city shop in the stores they 'd come to us and visit the other retailers in west park as well it would also be a great opportunity to encourage new retailers into west perth we have a massive vacancy rate and people don 't want to lease or buy in west perth there 's very little free parking and most of the shops have closed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free parking for three hours on a saturday it encourages people to come in and not go to a local shopping centre and use the city um dave where do you staff pack a lot of them pay for parking in the multi-story car parks on saturdays they take advantage of the free parking on on the street or under cover parking where we are okay all right thank you are there any further questions from anybody dave thank you very much we appreciate your deputation thanks for listening thanks for your passion for uh our community and in particular west perth uh can i invite steve wellard now did i steve uh representing west perth local to come forward who 's speaking for the notice of motion detailed in item 17.2 name and address steve if you could uh sorry i had a code person mandy was going to come up with this one as well okay sure uh stephen well out i 'm the president of west birth local and from 1303 hay street west perth and i 'm mandy mcavoy on the general committee of west perth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um lord mayor councillor ceo and senior managers today i 'm speaking in support of the notion of motion 17.2 free parking on hay street in west perth a little bit of history so in the mid 2000s west perth was reported as having the lowest commercial vacancy in the country and a village center that was bustling with foot traffic during working hours with a sophisticated and sometimes saucy nightlife topped off with afl crowds mostly sorry most weekends blending the footy with some great west perth hospitality when the suburb was first created in the 1800s west perth was supposed to be the two rack of the west and it was started it was starting to live up to that original marketing pitch before things changed fast forward 15 years a mining bust the online shopping boom and a pandemic our once great west perth is seeing a growing exit of retail and hospitality businesses something must give before we lose the strip completely to our growing neighbours of supe east level and west leader look we understand there are many factors internal and external that go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out as being unique to west perth when compared to our neighbouring suburbs they are paid parking and the effect of the perth parking levy we get it that the perth parking levee is a state government charge and the city is in discussions with the government to advocate for a better deal one that will level up the suburban playing field we welcome that and look forward to positive change however we need urgent change sorry how will we need urgent change to prevent the loss of more businesses and to attract potential new tenants away from the lure of our shining neighborhood villages it 's for this reasons that we fully support councillor angie 's motion to reduce the cost of parking in west perth however we feel it does not have a broad enough focus as there 's a number of streets in west perth they still have paid parking on saturdays 8am through to 6pm at a rate of 4.10 an hour so that 's effectively doubling the cost of a cup of coffee if you choose to have it in west perth how can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our streets are almost completely empty of a weekend so there 's no revenue being made from the paid parking machines to offset the perth parking levy all it 's really doing is maintaining a resident worker and visitor mindset that west perth is an expensive place to park shop and socialize west perth local 's request on motion 17.2 is to be amended to incorporate these changes effective immediately saturday paid parking to only be on hay street so make outragement collins streets monday to friday only saturday paid parking hours to be reduced to be 8 am to midday no charge anywhere for saturday afternoons nobody 's parking there anyway why are we trying to charge people and thirdly which is in line with the the motion the successful one-hour free parking initiative be extended west along hay street to thomas road implementing these changes will just take west perth village to a comparable state as our neighbours sorry to our nearest neighbours as outlined by their own parking initiatives if we look at subiaco across thomas road it 's free car parking on hay street okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have one hour free on weekends they have free parking weekends they have free parking after 5 p.m weekdays over in leadville it 's one hour free across the district they have a three hour free zone and they have a full car park that 's free after four pm and in west leaderville not as many initiatives but the price of parking is only 2.90 an hour and they have a 30 minute free period if we don 't change now to win back retail and hospitality businesses then we 'll lose more once subi east commences construction and marketing we seem to be running out of time thank you for your consideration and also thank you for allowing this deputation under the new rules for council meetings okay thank you mandy would you like to uh no nothing more to our thank you thank you very much thanks steve thank you mandy just stayed here if you don 't mind steve does anybody uh yes councillor angie thank you steve and mandy for the deputation sorry this is really far away um just a couple of questions just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure i got it right so you 're saying you support the extension of the free parking initiative which currently runs from emerald terrace to outrim to thomas street so you 're saying you would like an extension of that monday to saturday or just on saturdays we would like to see that one hour free period on hay street all the way up to thomas road so monday through to saturday yes monday through saturday okay cool and then the second question was um you note the you said the extension of the one one-hour free parking to outrun state and collins street and only have paid on hay street so which area of hay are you thinking would remain paid i know i feel that we could have hay street as paid parking but with the one hour free yep option okay but the concern we have is that altrum and collins streets when you turn off hay they 're still paid parking all day saturday for the first one or two blocks so it 's confusing that 's it 's confusing there 's actually parking meters that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very confusing what we 'd like to see is the saturday paid requirement taken off outrun and collins streets straight away just to make hay street the only place where you have to park on saturdays yep and then when you talk about the reduction of the the paid parking in west perth from 8 am to midday so you 're just saying across the board entire west perth every kind of pocket and village of west perth that 's reduced is that correct yeah and at the moment the only place where we have paid parking on saturday is hay street and those first couple of blocks on achievement colin nobody 's making any money whatsoever on saturday afternoons businesses are just closing up because it makes no sense if they did actually want to uh put paid parking in the best down at delhi street where all the watertown people park i mean that 's completely free saturday and sunday yep but uh yeah west perth is really that that precinct there is really suffering yep thank you thank you uh are there any further questions from anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here tonight we 're going to move now to disclosures of interest that 's item six on the agenda uh ceo we got any disclosures received tonight yes lord mayor the following interests have been received an impartiality interest from councillor angie in relation to item 11.1 as she attended a rework breakfast and the developer was president of riwa at the time and impartiality interest from the lord mayor in relation to item 12.2 as a person known to him paul nash is involved with the management of the event and a financial interest from the lord mayor in relation to item 18.3 as 7west media is his employer and proponents have been in discussions with seven west media about supporting the event thanks ceo uh do any elected uh yes counselor angie sorry i thought you 're gonna move on yes i 've got a couple additional disclosures yes um so just in relation to 12.2 event sponsorship perth guard natural living a impartiality interest being that one of the contractors to the event paul nash is known to me having met paul last year and spoken to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to 17.2 being my notice of motion in relation to free parking on hay street impartiality in that i own an office at 1329 hay street west perth and i 'm a customer of many of the cafes lunch spots and other businesses on hay street including theory for hair and dave is here tonight okay can i tell your hair looks terrified counselor angie dave that 's as much for you as it is for councillor angie are there any further disclosures of interest from the floor oh okay thank you uh let 's go to the confirmation of minutes this is item seven would anyone like to move a motion to confirm the minutes of the ordinary council meeting held 22 feb thank you councillor fleeton can i have a second to please thanks councillor gobert uh do any members oppose this motion uh motion being unopposed i 'll now declare it carried unanimously questions by members which due notice has been given i to make there aren 't any correspondence the same 10 petitions none have been received so we go now to reports and before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion that the following items be carried on block a 14-1 monthly financial report january 2022 2 schedule of accounts paid january 20 22 and 16 1 audit reports 20 21 22 could i get a second of this uh sorry yes i 'm proposing that i 'm moving the motion so could i get a second to thanks council of fleet and any members oppose motion being unopposed will declare it carriage unanimously the recommendations of those items have now been passed on block in accordance with clause 9.2 of the city of perth standing orders local law 2009 and the officer or committee recommendations have been adopted by council so i 'll now be moving on to the reports extracted for debate firstly item 11 planning and economic development alliance reports 11 1 20 lot 3 mounts bay road crawley proposed amendments to an approved nine level residential development we note that there is a an impartiality interest received by councillor angie is that correct or is that leftover that is correct uh so would anybody like to move a motion to deal with this item thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayor so moving the officers recommendation and just a few comments before we move on um so i 've read the agenda paper i 've read what the community was saying with their feedback um listened to the or the discussion last week around this tree um just a few comments on the process i agree that we 're not judging the entire da again there 's not enough change to warrant that the water tanks will be judged in terms of its the building application in the next stage we just have to consider if the nils setback is okay the visual aspect of it seems to be addressed the noise issue will be addressed in the next stage from a building permit point of view but it comes to the the tree itself and there was some confusion last week which i think was clarified after the agenda briefing session when the city emailed us a snapshot of the city arborist 's review of the developers arborist report so i just want to read this for the record because that 's why i 've made the decision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this tree means that all the regrowth will not be able to attach to the main trunk appropriately which means that the risk of branch failure is now significant and will be an ongoing concern for the remaining life of the tree the regrowth scene is indeed healthy and shows the tree has good vitality however that 's not relevant as soon as the regrowth reaches a certain length and weight it will simply fail under high wind conditions and it goes on i was confused last week because i was getting different information it 's been clarified it 's not an ideal scenario so i 'm happy to support it thanks uh councillor clinton councilor angie your microphone might be on i just can 't see the red puppet thank you uh councillor gobert um as a seconder thanks a lot man just briefly along the same lines as cancer fleet and um if we were to go down the path of enforcing the condition of the original development proposal and to require this tree remain um i think we can see based on our own advice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar position where we 'll be without a tree looking to provide one in some future years so i think we can just cut out the middleman here and just say what is a better outcome long term and that is to in my view to approve the um removal of the tree although as council clayton quite rightly said not desirable um i think it is the better or the lesser of two evils here thank you thanks councillor governor does anybody wish to speak against this motion no so now any members suppose this motion no this motion being unopposed i will now declare it carried unanimously thank you we moved to item 12 community development alliance reports and 12 1 is the events planned 2022-23 would anybody like to move a motion to deal with this item all right thanks councillor co seconder councillor fleeton uh councillor ko i 'm happy to move with the um uh administration 's recommendations thanks councillor kai council of clayton well put council card very quickly i 'll add to it i think the city 's done a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand what the elected members want in terms of our role it 's a huge investment there 's obviously a lot that will be said regarding our product that we 've got to offer when we bounce back from covert restrictions whenever they 're lifted we 've only got a finite bucket but i urge the state government to think of the bigger events that the city could hold when they 're thinking of spending their money so we can only go a certain way but i think this strikes a good balance the christmas lights trail um being the uh signature event as long as that 's got some new attractions and is refreshed every year and it doesn 't become stale that 's that 's a good thing thanks councillor flynn uh do any members oppose this motion no we should speak against the motion counselor energy i just speaking i guess in favor but just noting um one point i 'm against and just referring back to the deputation from leslie warren last week from east perth community group in relation to um brass in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we now have a significant events budget and there 's a substantial item later on on the agenda this evening that whether we can look to to support that okay thank you um yes sir did you want um the acting general manager of communities to respond to that great idea thank you thank you through you lord mayor the brass and the grass initiative uh was supported in 2021 through a local activation grant that program will be available again in 2022 should east perth community group wish to submit application thank you louise much appreciated um yes councillor gobert thanks mayor um and along the same lines as councillor angie do we have an opportunity um either through the media budget review or through the annual process the annual preparation of the budget um to capture an additional spend should it be requested through the enabled activation process the 90 000 that has been listed there i think from the deputation last week from leslie she said it was just not enough to cover what they would like to have done but i 'm mindful that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion and so i don 't want to upend any process that we 've arrived at but i 'm just mindful of how we might capture additional costs if we 're able to at a later stage if it does eventuate that what they want to do is just not financially viable for them thanks councillor government ceo so the acting general manager community development please thank you through the lord mayor yes as part of the annual budgeting process we can look at where there may be um savings from other areas to bolster the offering in this plan as well as a media budget review as we 've done previously and added new events to the plan so just to follow up just to make sure it 's clear if through um through this process if it eventuates that a group might need just a little bit more is there a method that we can or do we have any sort of oversight or is there a way that we can respond to that quickly rather than it being the overall review of the overall program ceo thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i think the the budget that has been put up is only proposed the budget process hasn 't been concluded yet i feel there 's more conversation to be had to finesse so the budget has not been locked down as yet so if there are other opportunities you talk to the possibility of if there 's a little bit more needed last year the brass in the grass which was delivered by the east perth community group was done so with a recommendation from that group that they could deliver and they did a very uh very excellent event for a 15 000 grant or an activation grant which can be turned around very quickly they would also have opportunity in the major events or the larger events budget to also draw down and seek a larger amount of money if they wanted to change and upgrade the event as well so it 's our our belief that there are a number of opportunities available to our neighborhood groups to um to develop and enhance events thanks ceo said just for absolute clarity if say the east perth community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that opportunity to get twenty thousand if they were able to demonstrate they could deliver correct thank you okay thanks councillor robert thank you ceo uh for the purposes of absolute clarity is there anyone that wants to speak against this motion anyone else for the motion counselor co is anything you 'd like to add i 'm just a bit depressed i can 't attend most of these events thank you councillor kai that 's uplifting in its own way let 's put this to the vote then all those in favor and that is carried unanimously thank you everybody uh 12-2 event sponsorship 2021-22 that 's right so would anybody like to move a motion to deal with this item councillor gobert thank you a second to please thank you councillor fleeton councillor gobert councillor fleeton got to say how good it is for the residents on terrace road lord mayor i know you love terrace road certainly i get very good feedback about this and i 've got an apartment and i got a free plant from it last year i 'm not too sure if i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it yeah just grow on its own uh thanks councillor fleeton um is there anybody wishes to speak against this motion anyone for councillor angie yeah just to say it 's a great event i went along last year with my family and it 's i think it 's something that is really you know enjoyable for people of all ages young and old including my three and a half year old and you know when you look at um successful garden events across the country and across the world i know the melbourne um garden show is on at the moment which is hugely popular and you know we think of things like the chelsea garden show in the uk so i think this is a fantastic event to have on our city of perth calendar and just contribute to the diversity of the offer that we have thanks councillor angie uh councillor code did i see your hand up okay i might take this opportunity to say that the free native plans were a uh were an election uh commitment uh from this lord mayor rule candidate um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratepayers of the city of perth and they were so i 'm glad councillor gobert uh

notice of motion counselor sandy angie lighted up part three counselor angie has submitted a notice of motion regarding light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove your motion and we 'll ask you to reserve your reasons until the motion is open for debate thanks sword matt just the motion is that the council request the chief executive officer to one investigate opportunities for permanent light installations and welcome signage in the city of perth including but not limited to the mounts bay road pedestrian bridge buildings monuments streets malls laneways across our city neighborhoods two investigate opportunities for the private sector to be engaged in the provision of permanent light installations across the city of perth including but not limited to initiatives like percentage for glitch grants and sponsorship three investigate opportunities for permanent light installations to be delivered sustainably including but not limited use solar power and present these opportunities for consideration an elected member engagement session in due course thanks councillor angie do we have a secondary please thanks councillor gobert councillor angie the reason for this notice of motion is that if we 're going to be the city of light we need lights while events are one way of celebrating the theme of city of lights they are fleeting we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do this is with permanent light installations from experience we know that light installations are embraced and enjoyed by our city 's residents and visitors for example the success of the east perth community group 's tunnel of hope light installation during covert the historic hearts examples in perth 's east end and most recently we all went along to the launch of the city of perth 's east perth pedestrian bridge according to a google search in paris also known as city of light there are over 296 illuminated sites from hotels and churches statues and fountains national buildings and monuments and and 37 major 33 of the 37 major bridges further by engaging local artists in a program like this we will help provide assistance for our creative sector who like many others have had tough times through covert 19. thank you councillor angie um councillor gobert thank you a lot mayor um in support of councillor angie 's motion relating back to the lighting framework i note that it is covered from my root of it on page 51 as an area where we might need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle traffic medium risk of crime and high need to enhance the prestige of that area um i note that from councillor angie 's motion this is just seeking to investigate opportunities as we do all the time as a local government as an industry to see what might come of it it 's not necessarily necessarily to say that we are committing an amount to do something at the point of time um i think this is really how we need to be operating typically just generally as a local government when we have new ideas that come to us it helps kick start that discussion back with the administration about what we might be able to do so with the investigation into the mounts bay road pedestrian bridge we might see an option to light up one side of the bridge or two sides of the bridge we don 't know learning on some experiences in in the east nonetheless still a good lit up bridge uh but i 'd like to commend council angie for her motion and um ask for michael like the member support thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions so firstly can i say that i welcome the motion from uh councillor angie and the spirit of the motion and absolutely uh in concert with the theme of city of light i i notice him in response to the notice of motion there 's a couple of points here um one of them is that provision has been made in the existing city 's long-term financial plan for an annual budget of three hundred thousand dollars commencing in 2022-23 for aesthetic lighting so see my question there is is the spirit of what counselor angie has put forward uh in the notice of motion do we feel as though it 's captured by that or not captured by that lord mayor if i could ask the general manager planning and economic development to answer that question yes thank you through you lord mayor um we believe that the general intent is captured by the work that we 're already planning we do intend to come back to elected members anyway at a future emea session to look at which potential projects elected members would like to prioritize for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could discuss whether there 's anything else council would like included but pretty much the project that we 've already got on the go does capture the sentiment or the intent okay i just want to follow up if i make i want to be absolutely clear on this so i support the themes of what councilor angie is putting forward in the notice of motion but if i 'm understanding the answer correctly we have the mechanism in place and indeed a future am a future emes in place to deal with the same topics that this motion captures is that correct correct lord mayor okay um question counselor angie um i guess the notice of motion was quite specific there was kind of three parts to it so an investigation of lighting so i understand there will there is a current investigation underway i understand that now but i also highlighted areas of delivery so for example you know how could we engage the private sector you know how can we look at sustainable options so was that already intended to be presented in the ems is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach um so from the ceo to the gm through your lord mayor i guess we hadn 't got to the point yet we had where we had um decided exactly what we were going to present to elected members noting that we will only spend time on that once council has made a decision to endorse the budget if council wants to include the 300 000 in the budget we will then commence work on bringing forward a scope to elected members so certainly what 's been raised in the notice of motion can be contemplated in that work um it we just haven 't got to that point yet okay thank you um councillor fleet is this a question i 'm speaking for against that speaking four okay um a couple of comments i really like the idea for the percentage of light so i 'd like to see a paper presented on that sooner rather than later um we always talk about bigger rate payers and other stakeholders and their enthusiasm for the city of light light but i like this aspect of it because i want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what council wants out of this particular area i mean 300 000 won 't get as far for a one light installation per year um so we 're going to need our rate payers to come up with ideas for us and if we can incentivize by giving them more plot ratio or something like that sure thanks councilman clayton anybody wish to speak against the motion anybody else wish to speak for the motion counselor angie thank you for the comments and support by the other councillors uh i think you know it 's good to know that an ems emes session was already scheduled to consider lighting but what this notice of motion does it sets out clearly what we would like delivered at that emes session and you know that that does involve the three different aspects of what the notice of motion is the um looking at the different ways the different places and spaces we can light up but also looking at private sector involvement and also looking at sustainability there 's you know obviously considerable work in putting this together this information together for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will endorse this notice of motion so that we can be presented with the full amount of the information at the engagement session and be able to make an informed decision thanks councillor angie so we will now put this to the vote all those in favor that 's carried unanimously thanks councillor angie we moved now to 17 2 notice of motion from councillor angie free parking on hay street west perth councillor angie submitted a notice of motion regarding free parking on hay street west perth that counselor angie again as per the previous if you could move your motion will ask you to reserve your reasons until the motion is open for debate is it okay if i move a slightly amended motion after hearing the feedback so my amended motion is in two parts the first part being to support local business and neighborhood vibrancy that council endorses the extension immediately of the existing one-hour free parking initiative on hay street west perth on saturdays currently from emerald terrace to outrun street to include the bays west all the way to thomas street part two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and neighborhood vibrancy that the ceo investigate the cost implications of a the extension of the existing one-hour free parking initiative on hay street west perth on mondays and friday to fridays currently from emerald terrace to outrun street to include the bays west to thomas street b the extension of free parking initiative to outrun street and collins street west perth on saturdays and see the reduction of paid parking across west perth from 8 a.m to midday on saturdays and for the ceo to present this information for decision at the next council meeting chelsea andrew can i ask you to pass that if you don 't mind to the minute taker just behind you i think that 'll make the process easier lord mayor if i could ask if we should just have a minute or two just to digest that sure therefore to say if it 's okay if we can vote on the two parts separately so part one as one vote and then yes that could be done yeah i 'll wait for that to catch up so counselors if you can just keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of the motion with slight amendment yeah the first past not part isn 't correct yet okay counselor energy is that that 's still going okay how 's that going counselor engineer just changing the form thank you that looks correct now thanks counselor angie do we have a secondary second but just still deciding still processing yeah okay secondly um so do you want a little bit more time counselor before council around you goes through her yeah reasons yeah that makes sense thanks councillor government councillor andrew would you like to give your reasons oh sorry there 's just um a typo created now um there 's no part three that request that was in relation to part two that just delete the three and and just indent that yep okay thanks counselor angie that doesn 't make sense no no because you 've got to see a request investigate the cost implications of the ceo and to present this information for decision at the next council meeting okay councilman thank you the reason for this notice promotion is simple currently there is limited traffic or pedestrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see sections of hay street where there are no cars at all parked in the kerbside parking while there is currently one hour free parking monday to saturday in the one-hour parking bays on a section of hay street whereby customers will obtain a one-hour no fee payable ticket this initiative only extends from emerald terrace to outrun street the first part of my notice of motion is to extend this one hour free parking on hay street from emerald terrace to thomas street on saturdays as i said on weekends i regularly see sections of hay street where there are no cars at all parked in the kerbside parking on this basis it would seem that the cost of providing free parking in west perth should be insignificant and the administration report confirms this i know that point seven of the admins report it states that one hour paid parking is in place for remainder of hay street from monday to saturday and this has generated 59 000 in the current financial year with 2.4 on saturdays well 2.4 percent of 59 000 is just and 1416. of revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total cost of part one of my notice of motion is only one thousand four hundred and sixteen dollars well the cost of this initiative is modest the potential benefits the local businesses currently open on saturdays is obvious as stated by west perth local representatives this evening it reduces the cost of a saturday coffee by four dollars and the free parking in time may even encourage others to open on saturday contributing to neighborhood vibrancy for the apartment dwellers that live in hay street and beyond i walked around west perth in recent weeks and took note of which businesses are open on a saturday these are the ones i saw i apologize if i missed any atlas coffee shop at through one two three eight hey street open 8 a.m to 2 p.m saturdays and sundays jaffa shack 1 12 20 hay street also open eight to two saturdays and sundays cavani a gift shop 12 18 hey street open nine till two saturdays and sunday and mayfair news at one two o hay street open 10 till four on saturdays all of these are within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory for hair open on saturdays thank you dave for coming in this evening which is outside the current free parking zone on hay street i hear continually that the cost of parking and the time limits on street parking is a barrier to people visiting our city so let 's remove this barrier where it 's financially viable to do so and i think a cost of 1 416 is financially viable times are tough out there and any little thing we can do will make a huge difference to small business owners i 've added a part two to my notice of motion taking on the feedback that we 've heard this evening from west perth local the reason i 've split it up is we don 't have the financial data to support um these requests i 'm assuming that the again the earnings that we make are insignificant given that there 's no cars parked there but it 'd be great to have the exact details from the administration presented at our next council meeting so we can make an informed decision and then comprehensively review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 've got a couple of questions if i make firstly um uh ceo the uh figure quota there are fourteen hundred and sixteen dollars so the administration accept that figure as accurate could i ask the um acting general manager commercial services to answer this and any further questions through you the lord mayor um just wish to point the clarity on that 59 000 recently today we issued a uh cibn regarding that number and would like to point out that the fifty nine thousand dollar amount is actually all earned on a saturday um the notice down there point seven missed the word saturday and i do apologize that to elected members but it 's actually 59 000 has been earned on a saturday in this current financial year up to the end of february is that is that all of west perth or that 's on high street or you just need some clarity there i think yes through you the law mayor that is 59 000 throughout all of west perth on saturday on saturdays okay that 's for the financial year thus far is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2022. so what 's that end up being about 100 yeah is it what is it hundred thousand dollars i can 't say there was there was a typo there counselor angie from what i 'm hearing is that right um can i so to me one um so this notice of motion i think arrived last tuesday you feel first again i 've got great sympathy for the people of west perth in fact we 've got great sympathy for everybody within the city of perth uh and we know that parking is an issue um however this seems like a large body of work to kind of be comprehending on the run and i note here a map on on the cibn that appears to show different parking in different areas and we 've now got a notice of motion that breaks that further into different parking arrangements for different areas and i 'm not confident that i 'm going to comprehend that in the couple of minutes of debate here and for me it feels as though this is a little bit rushed notwithstanding as i said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight that this would be beneficial for them so i i 'd perhaps like some options on how we might be able to consider this body of work yet not rush it through tonight without you know being able to see a map see it highlighted understand what it means all of those sorts of things may i just ask a question i 've split it into two so it 's it 's probably with respect lord mayor it 's not entirely complex it 's it 's the first part is quite straightforward so i 'm just wondering where the complexity emerges from the part one well already we 're hearing different amounts um so we 'll see what other elected members uh think but can i just in response to the question how might we be able to get all the information back and then consider this properly how might we be able to do that gm through you lord mayor there is an enormous amount of work in this area we 've got over 2100 bays in the west perth area with over 480 of those bays doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to present all of that in a more detailed way to an elected member engagement session would give us everyone a fair grounding in that area and i think it actually goes well to actually explain some of the problems as well that we 're currently experiencing because we 're in a covert time which is something that i don 't know if we 've reflected on because the numbers are significantly down in this area at the moment for instance before covert hit we were having 970 000 cars parking annually in west perth and the year just completed it was down to 825 000. so there 's some impacts on our business that i think we all need to consider before moving forward okay uh thank you council accordance question i was speaking for again um administrative point firstly the second hasn 't spoken but before we get to that this is motions of which previous notice has been given and the addition of part two is not an amendment to part one it 's a whole new component to the motion so it can 't actually be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right all right thank you see you guys or noting me all right okay i 'll take that on board for the moment councillor government uh thanks a lot man um yeah i i agree with the intent of what counselor angie is proposing in the motion as the amended notice of motion or call of that and seek pending alternate advice from governance um i wonder just first before i continue on um i wasn 't sure if we were allowed to refer to the information in the cibn as it 's issued under confidential on the hub but if that second point under the current situation um the 59 000 has been discussed so bring it up what is the amount that we have foregoed or is our forecast that we have currently already foregone in revenue from having the three hours free on the weekend are we able to get some advice just for comparison to understand that um yes through uco to the gm through your lord mayor um we have one hour free parking areas as well available in east perth and claysbrook and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west perth we also have one hour free parking uh out at point fraser car park and we also have three hour free parking in our three major shopping car parks over the course of the current financial year we 're estimated anywhere between four to five million dollars in foregone revenue from these free parking initiatives thank you very much for that um i think um just based on the information from the neighborhood representative group this evening and given that council rng is asked to put the two components of the motion separately i 'm more than happy to support the first part of the motion and additionally also to the second part of the motion um i think it is absolutely important as you quite rightly point out lord mayor that we need to be making fully informed decisions understand the strategic implications of decisions that we make and there there is night and day between fifty nine thousand being forgotten and four and several million as mr hearn pointed out i think it 's worth understanding how that all works out um i 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on the best information that i have i i think that it is important to get that information from the ceo before we start just waving fees left right and center for everything that we do um is it even in the best location i don 't know i 'm sure that the passion that the speakers have spoken with tonight is founded in fact but i just want to make sure that i 'm getting a full some response from the administration as well i suspect very much so that um if it 's only 59 000 to the current financial year that it 's probably not going to be too much and that we could wear that or absorb that cost somehow as an operational matter of the city find that cost somewhere else take it off another project for example um but it it 's just having the fullness of that discussion that i think is important but for the immediate future if we can wave three hours free if we can set our free parking in some areas of the city i think we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you thanks councillor governor uh speaking for or against or a question moving a deferral motion okay so if the wording of the motion can read because i need to give a date deferring the motion to the april ocm to allow council to review on-street free parking options across the entire city at an emes before do we have a second for the thanks councillor gordon councillor fleeton no debate on that okay okay all those in favor of the deferral we have the lord mayor councillor gordon and councillor fleeton all those against councillor gobert councillor angie council of code governors uh so i 'm voting and so i 'd say that i 'm voting again as the little math there is a draw you have the casting boat so then you can yeah so i 'll use the casting vote then to defer that to the april ordinary councilman ordinary council meeting that 's correct okay thanks everybody we move now to 18 uh matters for which the meeting may be closed moving to item 18. uh we 'll move behind closed doors to consider the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be paused and i 'll move a motion to close the meeting to the public to have a second to their place thanks councillor fleeton could i now ask the public gallery to vacate the chamber and for the live stream to be paused thanks everyone for being here i 've got three here let me double check should it be yes thank you um do you need to wait for that timer yeah okay okay we will no one there thank you uh so we moved to item 19 now urgent business uh there is none so there being no further business i will now declare the ordinary council meeting closed at 6 36 p.m thank you very much everybody could you all please rise for the right honorable the lord mayor of perth mr basil zimbas dinner on the 11th uh 11th floor everybody please you"

everybody there is now a five minute limit for deputations that time has changed and if anyone 's been caught unawares by that please make that clear beforehand it 's our job to make sure that that 's been advertised and we will ensure that that has been siobhan it has yeah great so five minutes i 'm going to invite now george ashton representing element advisory and danielle davison representing westbridge funds management to come forward who are speaking for the officer 's recommendation in 11.1 so would you like to come forward are you both speaking is this george you 're both speaking george or just you i 'll speak you can take your mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just again state your name and address and away you go thank you um and thank you very much today let 's get you straight on if we can just under the microphone thank you ashton ahmed um i 'm here today representing the developer for item 11.1 being the proposed amendments the approved apartment development at 20 mounts bay road i would like to start by thanking the city 's officers for their work in progressing this application to date and confirm our full support for the offices report and the recommendation for approval modifications made to the design are typical of the level of refinement that usually occurs as a result of detailed design development and market testing that is undertaken following planning approval in this regard we consider the proposed amendments to be minor in nature with no change proposed to the approved land use dwelling mix building height or plot ratio as noted in the officers report the existing lemon-scented gum tree at the mountains bay road frontage was intended to be retained in the original design however the tree was unfortunately damaged by inappropriate pruning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have reasonably been anticipated by the developer independent arborist advice that was obtained following the previous planning approval whilst acknowledging that the tree is alive has since concluded that the tree will offer little amenity value moving forward and its retention would be unsafe as poorly attached regrowth would be likely to fall during inclement weather we acknowledge this is unfortunate but it is the reality of the situation and it is essential that the safety risk associated with the tree is addressed in accordance with the advice received from an independent arborist and the city 's own technical experts the developer is happy to replace the tree and it has been agreed with the city 's offices that a 2 000 litre eucalyptus tree is the appropriate size and species in the circumstances a larger initial pot size of planting was offered by the developer but the city 's officers have expressed a preference for a smaller tree at planting to ensure that it can better establish itself over time this replacement tree will form an important part of a revised high quality landscaping response that includes additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees three medium trees and nine small trees included within the overall landscape design the additional fire infrastructure has also been located and designed to sit below the height of a standard boundary fence to ensure no adverse bulk and scale impact on surrounding properties whilst all other changes we consider to be minor in nature and are contained within the previously approved building envelope as noted in the offices report the relocation of the communal gymnasium will also be subject to the existing requirements of condition five of the approval which requires the development to be constructed in such a manner that noise levels and noise intrusion are ameliorated to the satisfaction of the city so as to prevent any adverse impact on adjoining properties in this regard the removal of the previously approved outdoor pool in favor of fully enclosed communal facilities at the rear of the building is likely to have a positive impact on noise generation due to the increased opportunities for sound isolation for internal communal facilities for these reasons we believe this remains a high quality development and we would respectfully request council 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendation as i mentioned earlier i 'm here with representatives from the developer and the architect and collectively would be happy to answer any questions that you may have thank you for your time thank you george appreciate that and stay there if you might just uh on the off chance or otherwise that counselors have any questions uh do any of our counsellors have any questions in relation to the deputation we 've just heard uh deputy lord mayor thank you very much for coming tonight why did you decide to remove the pool from your design with your permission i might hand that over to the developer it 's danielle is it yes it is danielle davison from westbridge funds management um we on the advice of our sales agents that the demographic that we were targeting would not use the pool a communal pool and instead that area would be better suited to a private common space thank you and has that reduced the overall cost of the project which was estimated about 12 million this time around is that what it was last not the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's difficult to quantify i mean you could argue that maybe structurally there might be some savings but um we 've seen a 30 increase in construction costs so any savings got lost a long time ago danielle you mentioned the demographic there that you 're what demographic are you after would you say rich people no high net worths um generally from the east coast um locals downsizing we 've had a lot of interest which has been surprising from locals selling perhaps in the dow keith and netherlands area looking for something that 's low in maintenance we 've been surprised at how local the interest is compared to offshore which we may have expected but um obviously this is a premium location so it 's a very narrow demographic and we 've i guess designed it accordingly okay thank you do any further counsellors have any questions either for the developer or for george yep uh councillor gordon thank you lord mayor just wondering where you 'd normally locate the fire tank on a development like this there 's a number of locations you could um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can a number of factors affect that though so the pressure flow is one thing and that 's definitely been an issue for us on the site um very old infrastructure around crawley but also um because we are on the escarpment there there is a lot of limestone so we 've had to raise the fire pumps and that 's why we 're having to put it above ground where we are it is as george pointed out still below the fence line so it is still hidden but um typically i 'd say 99 of the developments i 've worked on in 25 years they 've been under the basement thank you there any for our council of satan thanks have you used morin and sun 's trees before uh no and we 'll never again um i think i pointed out at the previous approval that we um we actually weren 't the ones that instigated the tree pruning originally it was the next-door neighbours over concerns that they had that the branches overhung their driveway and it was actually them that sought the quote from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should anyone to trust morin and son they 're registered and qualified um tree room um arborist um unfortunately in this instance there 's a lot of heated words over it um but they didn 't do what they said they were gonna do and we suffered i guess and no one suffered more than the tree anything further from any of the councillors okay with that george danielle thank you thanks for being here thanks for playing your part we 'll move to our next deputation i 'm going to invite leslie warren one of our favorites from the east perth community group to come forward who 's speaking for the officer 's recommendation for item 12.1 leslie welcome name and address please thank you very much lord mad leslie warren 7 bronte street east perth lord mayor deputy oops sorry rely on technology here deputy lord mayor lord mayor councillors ladies and gentlemen my name is leslie warren i 'm speaking today on behalf of the east perth community group thank you for the opportunity to make representation to the council with respect to the events plan 2022-23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 22-23 year a series of events including the signature event of the christmas lights trail from november to january we were pleased to be chosen for two installations in claysbrook cove this year although in common with west perth one of our installations was late in arriving due to shipping delays not the fault of cancel it would be great to see further installations further down adelaide terrace if possible maybe leveraging off the new adelaide terrace footbridge lights and the extension of the new light poles down adelaide terrace having these lights extend into east perth really helps cement our place as one of the city 's neighborhoods and it 's a great place to live play and work we 're equally pleased that the city is further preparing to extend the city of light shows by drone this as well as utilizing drones for new year 's eve and australia day offer a far more environmentally sustainable way to light up the city than by fireworks it is also welcomed by many of the dog-owning residents in the city informal feedback we received about the inaugural show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the projections being on the loop i wasn 't actually there so i i 'm relying on what people have told me here secondly we 've also been told that there were long queues for food with the food offerings from food vendors oops sorry from food vendors on the day i 'm not sure what arrangements were made with local traders i assume unless okay as one of the community groups we are potentially benefiting from the neighborhood activation component in the plan this proposes a budget of ninety thousand to be spread across the six neighborhoods to support community connection around the australia day period we are pleased that this is included in your calendar we would however like to know if the budget was derived from actual costs in the 21 22 year as those bid figures don 't actually show in the budget you 're presenting to cancel this period because those invoices probably haven 't come in yet or wouldn 't come in when this month 's council meeting was prepared so the figures don 't really tell us the comparison between what was spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also we 're curious as to whether it allows for all of the neighborhoods or community groups that this year may not have actually taken up the option of an activation my understanding is not not all of the neighborhood groups did if we are lucky to gain activations in our precinct as a community group we 're certainly very happy to assist with letterbox drops for such events if we sorry we are disappointed to see that although there is a budget for a christmas nativity on the 17th and 18th of december again this year there 's no budget for brass on the grass i know there 's also no budget for sidewalk sounds in west perth and neither of these events appear in your event time table the brass and the grass event has been running in east berthous in some form another for 10 years likewise sidewalk zones this year the city didn 't stage these events and for east perth instead after a fifteen thousand dollar grant to the east perth community group was approved in mid-november the community ran the event i must say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteers the time frames and uncertainty were made a bit tricky but we did get there in the end if this is to be the same again this year we would very much like to know when the grants program for 2223 will be open and we 'll also very preliminary exploring the potential for an arts exhibition in november but that will also be dependent on the time frames for grant applications and i 'm asking if it 's possible to know in advance or even have the grants program open before july of this year i know it gets tricky with cross-budget years but effectively means we lose three or four months to do anything and that 's tricky because it coincides with the agm and the crossover period finally it 's really good to see a budget for leveraging and activation with a reference to the optus stadium and other facilities that stage large sporting and other events as part of the gateway to the stadium we 're really keen to work with the city and local businesses to help leverage off events with the vote with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leslie does anybody have any questions for leslie any of our councillors thanks lizzy all of those points have been noted uh we appreciate you being here now i understand there was a gentleman thanks leslie uh now i understand there was a gentleman who had uh advised of a deputation but for whatever reason it didn 't make it to our notes is that correct is that gentleman here would you like to step forward sir if you could your name and a dress and am i right in saying it 's on item 11 1 the mounts bay road crawley item that is correct thank you sir name and address if you don 't mind five minute time limit yeah thank you there 's no show without punch oh we 're great my name is peter oates i 'm the chairman of the council of owners at crawley house which is located immediately to the north and contiguous with this development site in may 2021 i made a deputation on a number of points of the of the da at 20 mounts bay road one of which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to note the savage pruning that had occurred to the tree and i made the point that the tree may in fact not survive in response the developer at the meeting was quick to take the floor and reassure council that the pruning was undertaken by a competent arborist and they were assured the tree would survive healthy and fine i think were the woods that were used now this tree is a nuisance to the developers in its current position and even with severely trim branches it will impede heavy duty equipment during demolition and construction and if it recovers severely impact the view of the bottom few floors in the southwest direction now let 's take let 's let 's come to today in advice received from council regarding this meeting the public were advised that the tree is no longer feasible its integrity has been compromised we are now told the arbors went beyond his remit this completely contradicts what council heard from the developers at the may 21 meeting at which the va was approved the developers are now saying it 's a safety hazard council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of which was this lemon-scented tree was to be preserved and protected during the demolition and construction if these if this tree does not survive then condition 16 of the da is violated councillors right throughout the metropolitan area have taken deliberate and specific action on developers and individuals who take unilateral action on matters important to council trees are considered important this is a copy of last week 's post there 's a photo there uh with the councils from the city of netherlands they they want to develop what they call a forestry trees in the netherlands trees are important cottas like council took swift and direct action and required a hoarding bee directed where a tree once existed against a resident who destroyed a verge tree this being a clear message to the rest of the community this contrasts starkly with the developer who wrote to council and labelled all the proposed changes as minor the question now for council is what course of action will council take to the da amendments knowing it is likely the tree has been slowly destroyed well first and foremost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtle and regular pruning then so be it let 's be clear on this the developers through their contractors and careless action created this outcome they have to solve the problem to satisfy condition 16. the council has three choices if the tree does not survive it can withdraw the da approval knowing the condition of the da has been violated it can have the tree removed and replaced and insist on a hoarding be erected to the same size and height until the tree grows to the same height the size as the hoarding this decision and subsequent action being a clear signal actions of contractors are the responsibility of the developer and developers must own the outcome or the third option is the council can roll over and approve the amendments so what should the council do there 's plenty of evidence of developers taking unilateral action and then facing stern reaction from council let remind let me remind everyone of the actions of the subiaco council a developer started to demolish aged buildings in hay street arguing they were unsafe the council took swift and decisive action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great inconvenience to businesses and traffic so so what do we have here the developers are saying the tree is unsafe remove condition 16 then remove the tree and we 'll plant other trees elsewhere on the site this tree does not have a safety problem every tree in the city of perth is a safety hat problem if they are neglected some trees need more attention than others take for example the flame trees in kings park road these trees are notoriously brittle the council ensures there is a regular pruning program to avoid falling branches the tree in this development if retained will require more attention to encourage appropriate branch growth and what caused this need the savagery of the developers arborist this council must now make a decision on these amendments the challenge for this council is whether it can focus on city-centric matters as well as matters in suburbia that have overwhelming community support and require developers to be held responsible for their actions and comply with approved d a conditions the tree must be retained and the developers need to care and nurture the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be too far gone a replacement lemon scented tree be replanted in the same position after a hole with adequate depth and width is prepared together with a hoarding the same size as the existing tree the hoarding to remain in place until the tree reaches the current size this obligation incentivizes the developer to prepare the area for planting in a correct manner thank you uh peter we appreciate that and i 'm sorry that you were left off our list i 'll just get you to stay there in case uh any of our counsellors have any questions for you hey councillor fleeton thanks uh mr oates um hear the issues on the tree loud and clear but on the fire tanks close to the setback any comments there from your owners well um we we were concerned to the extent that they were going to be buried and that would impact on the um on the wall that 's already there and since we 're at a higher level than the the developers the development um then we would be responsible um in future years to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um about the way that 's managed and we 'll be watching it extremely closely uh thank you peter um are there any further questions uh mr the so we heard there um the suggestion that the existing on-site lemon gum tree be replaced with a mature 2000 litre tree we heard the type of tree did we not do you have a view on that type of tree if we were at that situation i i haven 't seen the tree in full bloom and what to what size it grows but this this is about respecting trees that are in situ council acknowledge that and all i 'm saying is that tree should should survive if it can or be replaced if necessary so not about the tree but about the principle absolutely you know the other councils surrounding us are doing that okay thank you are there any other questions from any other councillors no mr oates thanks for being here thank you thank you we appreciate it and again sorry that we missed your spot on the run down we 're going to move now if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are we 're going to move to item 6 on the agenda disclosures of interest i see i have any disclosures been received yes lord mayor the deputy law mayor has declared an impartiality interest in item 18.2 as she is on the board of tourism wa and i understand there is also the eu law may have declared a financial interest in item 18.1 as seven west media are a potential uh are potentially involved in the proposal thank you uh councillor angie is this a disclosure of interest from the floor yeah it is um in relation to 11.1 i remember when the matter came up before i think the developer wasn 't named in the papers that we had but i think there was um one of the there was i admit the the developer before okay so you weren 't aware then because yeah the developer wasn 't named and the developer um was president of river i think right at the time so i 'll disclose that is that just for noting just impartiality yeah okay thank you councillor fleeton from the floor well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter was raised last year i did have a financial interest because i worked for a firm that did work for one of the parties i 'm no longer working for them okay got advice from the city lord mayor saying that i can take part in discussion and the vote so that 's why i 'm taking part in this one just for council lisa 's benefit thank you for the clarity council of latin i 'm not sure what the last bit meant but thank you for the clarity anyway okay that 's good keeping ourselves uh accountable holding ourselves to account as uh as it should be are there any further um uh disclosures of interest from the floor anyone nope thank you item seven confirmation of minutes eight questions by members which due notice has been given nine as correspondents ten is petitions items seven to ten will be dealt with at the ordinary council meeting next week and we 're moving on to reports as we move through the reports i will ask if any counselors have questions in relation to the items to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them is eleven uh planning and economic development alliance reports eleven one um mounts bay road crawley proposed amendments to an approved nine level residential development uh are there uh we note that there were questions from councillor fleeton and councillor gordon uh councillors yeah thank you for the answers so take them all as read i 've just got some follow-up if i can i might go one at a time through to the gm if that 's okay um we 'll go first through the ceo in the first instance and then from there so say an example where council doesn 't agree to allow the tree to go what actions would we be able to take if that tree wasn 't then kept up to health ceo so if i could invite the general manager planning and economic development to answer any questions in relation to this item thank you through you lord mayor i guess the options that are available to council are to either refuse the amendments to the planning application which would then capture the request to amend condition 16. alternatively council could approve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both those options would require the tree to stay and if the development was then progressed with a tree in place and the tree was then removed then we would be able to take compliance action for non-adherence to a planning condition and what would that look like through your lord mayor the there are penalties under the planning and development act for non-compliance with the planning condition don 't always move straight to prosecution it may be that there is no choice to remove the tree at that particular stage so then the city would work with the developer to make sure that a suitable replacement was established in its place and if that was not done then it would move through the compliance to a prosecution process two more lord man one on the tree so is it of this is it the city 's opinion now that we 're at that stage where the tree should go given what 's happened we can 't take back what the tree lockers did through your lord mayor i think the city 's technical offices are of the opinion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is potentially a safety issue in future when the regrowth starts to grow it would require a lot of maintenance and attention but despite that they are concerned that there might be a safety issue so they do agree that we potentially to be safe the tree should be removed and replaced okay one last question on the fire tanks um do we have any other examples where we 've gone right to the boundary and allowed that type of infrastructure to sit right there is that normal through your lord mayor fire tanks not that i 'm aware of for a development of these scale but certainly it 's not uncommon for structures to be placed on boundaries setbacks are usually required to prevent building bulk from imposing on on neighbours visually or to to result in loss of light and other amenities in this case given the structures are below the fence line and are going to or propose to be tailored so that they have that fourth dimension as viewed from above that is blended with the landscaping on site it should not be an amenity issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located on the boundary if they don 't provide an amenity issue for neighbours a fire tank specifically i can 't think of a recent example thanks and just for the city do the deputations into the public see these questions and the information that you give us see governance it 's included in the further information in the ordinary council meeting agenda yeah thank you uh now in just a few we 've got councillor gobert uh councillor angie i 've seen a hand but councillor gordon firstly there was a couple of questions here which have been answered if there 's anything further no okay councillor gobert if you 'd like to uh demute yourself uh away you go thank you a little bit i think in response to point seven that was raised by councillor fleeton um the commentary from the city there describes that using aerial imagery the value of the tree 's been estimated at 107 000 what 's the value of the replacement tree if we went down the path of that 2000 liter tree thanks councillor gobert ceo to the gm um through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tree at hand i can certainly provide that information to elected members before next tuesday okay thank you thanks i guess the point of that is follow-up question do we have any recourse if we went down the path of enforcing strictly the planning condition and then seeking the value of the difference in that amount uh ceo to the through through the ceo to the gm um through your lord mayor i guess the value that we place on those trees and our ability to recoup that really just applies to trees in the public realm he doesn 't apply to trees on private property so we 'd not be able to recoup any of that value okay thank you councillor gobert thank you that 's all thank you councillor angie i 'm just confirming that if there is to be a replacement tree would it be in exactly the same location would we specify that thank you from the ceo across to the gm through lord mayor i do believe it 's in the same location um or thereabouts it certainly isn 't in a in much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's in the same spot yeah if you could confirm that that seems to be an important matter raised by the um affected parties of the deputation this evening thanks jim thanks councillor angie any further questions on that item no yes deputy lord me thank you lord mayor i just wondered um the original arborist who apparently did the heavy pruning that has caused this damage to the tree do we go back to the original arborist to seek their opinion or did we get a new albarist and seek an alternative opinion okay um so yeah to the gm through your lord mayor um the um applicant sought an alternative or an alternate arborist to give us an opinion but we have our own arborists that work with our technical staff and so we relied on them for to form our own opinion on this it wasn 't the arborist that was originally used thank you any further questions counselors lord mayor sorry just to clarify in my mind back to the first answer of the gm i thought in reading the paper that the tree was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it and the pruning went too far and so we have to remove it but in the answer that the gm gave i got the impression that the advice is now that if it grows back it 's so big it could drop limbs it could be dangerous in the future so that 's why we 're approving the removal could you please clarify that i might be hearing it wrong okay so by the ceo to the gm for some clarity on that thank you um yes thank you through your lord mayor i guess our our experts internally have the view that the lopping com compromised all subsequent regrowth and that retention of the tree would require extensive ongoing monitoring although the current regrowth appears healthy and shows that the tree is in decent health as soon as the regrowth reaches a certain length and weight it is likely to fail under high wind so um in terms of the advice we 've got from our own internal people it 's as this tree starts to regrow it could potentially potentially be a safety sorry so there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a future state where it gets too leafy jim correct yeah deal is there any chance we could see these arborist reports because these trees are known as widow makers they 're they 're known as trees that drop their limbs um so i don 't find that particular you know i just i just wondered if we could get a look at our breast report uh ceo to the gm through your lord may we can provide the arborist report that was submitted to us with this application and we can provide additional information from our technical staff thank you very much anything further from any councillors no okay thanks general manager we 're going to move to item 12 and 12.1 is the events planned 2022 2023. uh we note firstly a number of questions received with notice from councillor fleet and i think there was four councillor gobert two we 'll start with you council fleeton uh anything further on those councillor gobert was there anything further you saw or any clarity on your questions nope thank you good use of the um hand signal uh any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay thank you we moved to 13. there were no infrastructure and operations alliance reports 14 is corporate services alliance reports 14 1 monthly financial report january 2022 at council fleet and firstly a number of questions from you thanks a lot matt they 're fine just in the paper in its entirety when the city can 't provide details in this forum can the city please follow up with a note to all elected members rather than just saying sorry we can 't give it to you in this forum it 'd still be good to get the info okay so legal advice and then when specifics are mentioned around which property owners are in arrangements thank you ceo uh if i could just ask our chief finance officer to comment as it relates to information around the rates and that would be helpful thank you through the chair um specifically in relation to the um the rates questions um that information is available but that certainly would not come through in this format because we heard earlier they that that then ends up as further information in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people 's individual financial circumstances in a public forum but happy to take that one offline counsellor and and find a way to address that with you thank you michael are there any further questions on that item no reporting schedule of accounts paid january 2022. council fleeton need any clarity on yours no just the same issue we get the response that uh it 's legally privileged and they can 't tell us that 's fine in this forum but ratepayers are now spending over 1.5 million a year in legal fees i 'd like to get some clarity on when we 're going out to seek external advice uh thank you i 'll talk with general counsel she actually makes those decisions but um again if you want to speak specifically she is available and will enable that to occur thank you thanks ceo any further questions from any councillors uh deputy lord thank you lord mayor on um page 149 why do we pay linkedin 28 000 28 000 48.90 ceo can i take that on notice i 'm assuming it 's a membership uh but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar question that might need to be taken unnoticed why do we pay 3546.24 for a new york times subscription it 's page 164. and if we do who gets it although wordle is now um owned owned by new york world 's free yeah that 's a good point a ceo says linkedin um good question and we 'll follow up on that and the second part of the question will find out who actually does read it yeah or who gets it yeah gets it or is it a digital subscription which might be available to everybody what the new york times uh any further questions on fourteen two no okay thanks everyone uh 14-3 is it 14 15 rather 15 is chief executive officer reports 51 is the new council policy 1.8 code of conduct behavioural complaints management councillor gordon i know there was a couple of questions received with notice nothing

have the deputy lord mayor diebane councillor sandy angie councillor bevan councillor fleeton councillor gobert councillor coe and councillor lisa we have an apology today from councillor gordon in addition i welcome officers members of the public and any media in attendance tonight an apology has been received as i mentioned from councillor gordon and there are no councillors currently on approved leave of absence do any elected members have an application for a leave of absence so we now move to item four which is announcements and thanks everybody so um let me just go through a few things firstly i wanted to make mention of what took place at elizabeth key on saturday night i thought the event on saturday night was a triumph for our city and i want to thank the city of perth team i want to thank the team from drone sky shows a local company who did great work corporate sports australia who assisted with the event management wa police for their cooperation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of perth to the team from main roads and of course importantly to wa health whose rules and regulations we operated safely under the numbers from the city of perth preliminary figures on crowd attendance in the elizabeth key precinct were seven thousand two hundred in excess of seven thousand two hundred but we know there were significantly more people in the wider area and by wider area i mean the rest of our foreshore in the city of perth side also across to the bell tower area obviously kings park was very well attended and i spoke to a number of people who are up there and south perth was chock-a-block and again south perth benefiting from our good work i might throw in but good luck to them opportunistically and well played the bottom line is it was a fabulous event and it was event that was built from scratch and that is even more pleasing so what we have been able to do is put a new event on our calendar and that event can take off in a different direction from here on in but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and proud of the city of perth team for their cooperation i 'd also want to thank and congratulate all of the teams that were associated with the launch of the new era of the city of perth and the spirit and theme of city of light which included our new logo and to block branding and nani creative who had a short turnaround time well done on their very well received work we were able to tie all of those things together on the anniversary of the 60th anniversary of john glenn 's famous friendship 7 flight it was a triumphant weekend for the city it has been very well received and i must add we 've had an enormous amount of media coverage which money cannot buy so a shining light for the city of perth and we rightfully take back the name city of light and use it from this day forward for all of the great things that it means just one final point i think it 's worth saying that we operated that event safely and with common sense and everything was framed around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the the framework that they put in place for us and i think what it showed was people are capable of coming out following the rules doing it safely enjoying themselves and everything that the west australian lifestyle has to offer and then going home and returning to their normal lives and i think that sent a very strong message and we know that lots of other events in our community have been cancelled of late this is not um this is not singling them out there are lots of reasons why other events have had to be cancelled and we appreciate some of them have been financial considerations but i 'm super proud of the fact that the city of perth plowed on we decided we could do it safely we followed the rules and people turned out in great numbers and it 's a great triumph for the city of perth also i would like to mention some other items that are particularly significant including today and following off the launch of city of light and the anniversary today we announced the stage one perth bounce back package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support them and help them through the challenges and impact of covert 19 with a new support package i should note that this is stage one only and we will continue to respond to the requests and concerns of our rate payers business owners and operators but in short and you can read about it on our website there 's a dedicated page and a hub where people can go in short what we are offering is free nighttime parking that 's ten thousand bays street parking is free after six pm each night but that quickly fills this is every car parking bay in the city of perth free from 6 p.m from this friday night a very significant offering also fee free and fast-tracked alfresco dining permits if people are interested in putting tables and chairs out this front of their premises because it will enable them to continue to do business our f and b providers they will have that opportunity and i encourage them to take that up via our hub on our website and finally and significantly five thousand dollars offering to eligible businesses for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of five thousand dollars to help them attract new customers and also sustain their operations in this covert 19 environment that was launched at about midday today i thank the council for their support and indeed their encouragement to get these initiatives out there in a fast manner and they 've been very well received in the few hours that they have been live so to my councillors and to the administration who 've worked very hard to get this package together and get it out quickly and respond to our ratepayers needs i thank you very much for your cooperation in that area and to that end and part of that narrative last week i wrote to the premier and highlighted that there are concerns with mask mandates and omicron in our community that around 60 percent less occupancy has been recorded in commercial offices within the city and i 've asked the premier that in response we are indicated to the premier rather that the city is implementing a range of bounce-back initiatives which i 've outlined just there but also more is required and the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assist businesses to save costs at a critical time where there is a need for ongoing social distancing and the potential for many businesses to close temporarily if staff are unable to work we know this is a live issue in our community there are not as many people coming to work one initiative i 've highlighted to the premier which could immediately lessen the impact of covert 19 for businesses and assessed the recovery of the cbd relates to the perth parking levy the impact of the current levy on business is considered significant where the cost of the levy can make up a large proportion of the overall cost of property leases and so the city has therefore urgently requested the state to consider one refunding or not charging fourth quarter 20 21 22 levy payments and or to not imposing the levy for 20 22 23 and or making no increases to the levy for 2022 23 and we have asked despite the budgetary impacts that this would have on the state that the government give this the strongest possible consideration i also note and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter for discussion at the city of perth committee meeting which now has a new date of early march following a request from the government for it to be deferred by about a week or so because it coincided the previous date with the premier 's absence interstate so that has gone to the premier it is not new to the premier or the government it 's noise that the council is around this table have consistently made but it seems as relevant and as important as ever that this is strongly considered and that we strongly represent it to the premier who is the treasurer on behalf of the government so with that let 's return to the script and item 5.1 public questions see i have any public questions being received yes lord mayor thanks ceo i i believe it 's philip higgs that we are inviting to step forward philip if you could come forward state your name your address and there is a strict time limit of 10 minutes bonus points awarded for every minute that you go under 10 minutes well thank you for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first if you could phillip yep philip a higgs i reside at 201 108 bennett street in east perth first question can the council please advise what measures if any are being taken to prevent and stop the public drinking fighting allowed an aggressive shouting in domestic violence by large groups of people that is occurring on a daily basis in or near the children 's playground at wellington square which at times results inebriated people walking in front of cars and bennett street can the council please advise why there 's no security security cameras in that vicinity phillip thank you you 've got more questions but we 'll answer them as we go that might be the best way so ceo if i could invite the general manager community development to answer this and any future questions through the lord mayor thank you mr higgs for your question the city has introduced several actions to address these issues primarily the city is working closely with the wa police who are the core agency responsible for anti-social and criminal behaviour subject to other demands rangers patrol the area three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrol three times a shift both teams engage as appropriate with the people in the space and report any observed incidents of antisocial behavior drinking or drug use to the police immediately the city watch surveillance officers also monitor these areas via cctv cameras and there are 12 in the area so they review those each hour and also report anti-social drug use and drinking to wa police with other matters reported to appropriate departments to manage the cctv camera system has no audio function so loud aggressive language cannot be heard while monitoring cctv cameras a mobile cctv camera is placed on the park periodically when increased monitoring is required the city recently positioned a variable message board in the area to indicate a family zone and no alcohol yes there was movement of the variable message board okay and the shifts what are these two shift panel days and afternoons or three shift panels days evenings and nights so there is information that we 'll be placing on the website so you can get clarity because a range of shifts do change over the week but predominantly they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the week and then variable hours as i said the cctv cameras are also used to proactively review that area and report any incidents immediately to the police and that 's 24 hours phil you can take your mask off while you 're at the microphone and that might assist everyone i think just to be able to be clear you 're welcome so is there any reason why it was just shifted yesterday so just in terms of the variable message board that has been in place my apologies for at least a week uh there has been a repositioning of it closer to the playground and that was based on some feedback based on a community information that was provided back to the city and also to the police at the same time as a request so it was a proactive change but the variable message board was located elsewhere in that area there 's no thought to put it in there any other particularly with the children applying or they 're subjected to intimidation by various groups through the lord mayor we do respond to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidents are and as i said we have 12 cctv cameras there we did have the variable message board there in regards to the ensuring that people were aware they couldn 't consume alcohol on the premises and as i said we got some recent information as one of our stakeholder meetings that happened on friday last week that involved a regular meeting with police and a representative from the east perth community group and that feedback was a request in terms of looking at relocating it which we 've responded to phil can i just jump in there too in my 16 months of experience now with this these areas and these issues and these anti-social issues the message boards have an impact and that might last a few days or a week and then they tend to have less impact and so it is important that it moves and we try and maximize the impact it 's only one one weapon it 's not i understand that but it just it doesn 't make sense to me but it 's on the corner of wellington and further right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually in the area yeah okay fair enough and noted thank you okay in relation to the second question can the council please advise how regularly and what times the council rages security watch police and other security patrols take place at the park and the gathering information with the instances most occur thank you kyle we 'll go back to you through me so our service level commitment is for rangers to patrol the area a minimum of three times per shift cultural outreach patrol three times per shift also and as i said the surveillance officers patrol the cameras every hour this is conditional on staffing levels and workload and other operational demands across the city currently we have increased our cctv patrols to every 15 minutes for this area and a range of other key locations again all anti-social criminal drinking and drug behaviours are reported to wa police immediately police patrols and actions are independent of city of perth actions and our patrol times are targeted based on intelligence-led resourcing models informed by analysis of the cctv incident trends other known hotspots across the city and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident there where there 's quite a large amount of hole drunk it broke out at seven o 'clock at night it required three police cars there six on push bikes the frustrations that myself and other people that live in that area if the individuals were monitoring and doing it properly it would not get that far surely anybody can see that if the individuals were monitoring it and relaying it back it got very nasty there so when there 's four police cars tied up three on bikes that 's taking it away from north bridge and somewhere else and it could have been prevented that day mr just a reminder that we 're here for questions and not statements although can i say i share your frustration i absolutely hear your frustration this is an area that we spend a lot of time on and we want results we want results as much as you do and as much of the community and in fact we are the community but i do understand what you 're saying uh on that specific point kyle is there a response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone who if they do see incidents of antisocial behavior to contact the police directly and as i said as soon as we observe any incidents on the cctv cameras 24 hours a day seven days a week we report it immediately and and log it through so we can get our data so again uh the response for the police is a separate action that they would need to address and respond to but certainly in terms of our service standards we do advise the police as soon as we observe any behaviours and we encourage the community to also do so thank you i think basil 's already answered this question but i will put it in there is the council aware of the concerns raised by many east perth local residents and popular social media accounts such as the east perth local yeah uh so the question was is it is it monitored did you say no is the canceler where oh well absolutely aware because we 're frequent visitors readers posters contributors uh we interact uh we absolutely follow along with what 's being said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fight against anti-social behavior in that area and it 's one that we use and take very very seriously the city of perth has a significant role to play here but we are not the only ones and we work and continue to work with state government and i 'm absolutely delighted to say that minister kerry who is not only the local member for perth but also now assumes control for a good deal of this area and some of the anti-social issues that are taking place has has general oversight for this we continue to work with him with the police and all of the other agencies that are engaged for better outcomes and and quite frankly phil it occupies a lot of our time and occupies a lot of my time and it is something that we are desperately keen to get a result in so i understand your frustration your frustration is my frustration and the conversations you 're having here are conversations we often have here we will keep going until we get a result we were going well there was a significant improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square has been a great boon for the area and it is with some regret that it is not fulfilling its potential at the moment because some of the anti-social activity that has crept back in but just because it is crept back in now doesn 't mean we are prepared to let that rule it doesn 't mean we 're not turning maximum attention to it and it doesn 't mean we 're not working every day with police and the state government agencies and the minister to get a better result and that 's an undertaking i give back to you and the community we want a better result there and we won 't stop until we get one i think the frustrations that myself and i 'm not just speaking for me it was a pleasure to see the different ethnic groups that took advantage of that yeah and it 's been slowly destroyed because people that are living in the cbd now are entitled to mix and acts freely and not be intimidated yeah it 's quite tragic to see that 's happening on a continual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from here yeah you 've given me a fair hearing and i just hope that there is a bit more action so everybody can enjoy that park in the future this effort gone into from everybody and um let 's hope it can succeed yeah yeah philip thank you can i can i just leave this final message and i know this is relayed to community and sometimes it 's frustrating but it is super important in fact it is the us utmost importance that no matter how frustrated people in the community might be the first course of action still has to be to call the police if there is anti-social behavior this is a message that has been reinforced to us by both the police minister the police commissioner and the police officers in charge of our area so important that we call the police if we see a disturbance or issue so that they can log the issue and the response times and it is with that data that we are able to push ahead and get better results so we hear you we understand you um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please please call the police when there is an opportunity to do so just one last thing basil there 's a number of electricity boxes that get vandalized down there yeah now certain individuals open them up because there 's the availability of a three point plug a 240 where they break in i think the boxes would be predominantly to control the irrigation okay but it could be dangerous if someone does get electrocuted power points in there that 's correct so individuals break into their set up boom boxes and charge various electrical appliances but it is they could just plug into something that they shouldn 't touch to okay thank you phillip thanks for uh we appreciate you uh being here tonight and uh thank you for making your points well and we appreciate it in a uh in a respectful manner uh ceo are there any other public questions from the floor no lord mayor um well this is going to be very unusual because i think i know this gentleman 's name please come forward state your name and address please and you can ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but anyway now i know most the council people now i was over at south perth the other day for the drone show it was fantastic there was probably a hundred thousand people from the narrows right across to the boat shed stacked in there how many sorry probably a hundred thousand thank you and the reason they were there was because they could actually get there there was no parking restrictions like the resident sky show from the city of southwest which i 've said them and i know all the people over there and i 've talked on the radio before this we are now trying to organise with greg milner the mayor there and also the local mpo of the cap buses service that will go from the ferry all the way up to carolee tavern across the schools and back around the boats along middle point milton road which will bring a lot of people into the city and be able to access the ferry now one of the complaints with all the people over there there is no parking close to the ferry so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars and they don 't want to park in the city because it costs too much apart from what you announced before so what i was saying before is uh with basically we need a question in here mouse of course remember yes do you think the cap buses will be assistance to get people in the city number one and to the people like the zoo but also the mount lawley area get them in through there but also big park area because a lot more people will actually come to the city if they can access the buses to get through thank you uh mr mouse from south perth um ceo is there a question there anyone um i i think there are actually buses and bus routes but um i hear what you 're saying about the cat system which actually is funded via a levy on all of the parking bays across the city so i think that would be something that the other local councils would want to think deeply about before they introduced a levy into their parking arrangements however we can redirect your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the department of transport great and uh we can raise some of those concerns we have the inner city uh local mayors and ceos and we can raise that with south perth at that time thank you for being here mouse and uh thank you for your question item six on the agenda is disclosures of interest see i have any disclosures

sorry seconded by councillor fleighton any members opposed this motion uh this motion being unopposed will declare that carried unanimously the recommendations of those items have now been passed 162 as just mentioned they 've been passed on block in accordance with clause 9.2 of the city of perth 's standing orders local law 2009 and the officer or committee recommendations have been adopted by council right so item 12 community development alliance reports 12.1 is event sponsorship 2021-2022 round two a revised officer recommendation was circulated to there was circulated two elected members prior to the meeting would anyone like to move a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councillor gobert um i just wanted to move an amendment sure okay oh sorry isn 't it second at first yes seconded by councillor clayton councillor angie sorry yeah sorry speak to it first and then we come back counselor nothing to say thanks thank you very much councillor gobert thank you lord mayor i just want to move an amendment to 12.1 c the event sponsorship for winter lights at brookfield place my proposed amended which there should be a copy on the screen the council approves event sponsorship totaling 135 000 excluding gst for brookfield commercial operations for winter lights at brookfield place comprising of 80 000 for winter lights 30 000 for local live 10 000 for carbon neutral initiatives and 15 000 for evaluation and covered contingency my reason for this amendment is that the winter lights festival is an annual transformation of brookfield place with a light display and activates that entire precinct as described in the papers provided to us and the public the event features the latest light technologies and performances that surprise and delight visitors to the festival including light projections on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this year the introduction proposed of a new component local live featuring live art music and local entertainment to support local artists impacted by covert this event is spot on the city with the city 's theme of city of light and the new brand launched by the lord mayor at the weekend and further the new local live component as i just mentioned has been created to support and engage local artists impacted by covert and challenging times for our community and as a city works on its first sustainability plan the proposal to implement carbon neutral component to the event is another great initiative so it just ticks many boxes for the city of perth in the strategies it 's pursuing i understand this application like others in the sponsorship round have been assessed by the administration but you know obviously this is an inexact science and in the end it 's brought to the council for final decision and a number of occasions throughout the year we 've moved amendments of this nature the event attracts a significant crowd estimated at 45 000 at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my understanding is that this year the city will not pursue its own winter festival at this time so let 's provide greater support for this initiative on this theme of city of light on point with the city 's brand and help it grow and succeed and encourage others in the community to create events on the theme of light thanks councillor angie do we have a secondar for the amendment thank you councillor bevan councillor angie has spoken so uh councillor bevan i think council angie articulated it very well but we talked about activating perth if there was a time we need to activate perth now is the time and i think this is a good motion thank you councillor bevan does anybody wish to speak uh anyone else speak wish to speak for the motion to ask a question yep sure what did they ask for yeah ceo if i could invite the general manager community development to answer this and any other questions that may arise i thank you through the lord mayor the request was for 70 000 for the delivery of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 formal research in terms of social impacts economic impacts and event outcomes was 25 000 and contingency for covid was 25 000 and carbon neutral initiatives were 20 000 so 170 000 in total and the assessment panel recommendation for the winter lights festival was remained at 25 000 as opposed to the amended motion for 80. thank you so sorry just to be clear there they asked for 170 000 and we 're giving how much through the lord mayor 70 000 so the uh the recommendation is to retain the 25 000 for the event which is the same as we 've had for the last three years but to also add an additional component of thirty thousand for the local live the new element in the festival and there was also support in that seventy thousand to add fifteen thousand for research and covert contingency and that 's detailed in the attachment c in the item okay i 'm i 'm still a bit sorry i 'm still confused on how much we how much they asked for and how much we 're giving they so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 70 000. okay so the answer 170 we 're giving 70. okay uh is yes can i ask a question i 'm a bit confused by this layout do you include in-kind support in the cache so you say at this the start of the um item the council approves the following event sponsorship totalling this cash value are you including any in-kind in that through the lord mayor not in this submission so there 's no request for in-kind in their application so this is without if there is in kind in the submission then we do put a note in to say there 's an estimate to the value of x amount for the city fees uh on this occasion there were no city fees in the submission so can i confirm that the dollar value of the recommendation notwithstanding sandy 's uh councillor angie 's amendment the dollar value we 're talking about is cash only yeah that is correct thanks are there any other questions that might be useful before i might assume to speak or speak against the amendment okay um so in previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panel has looked at 70 000 so it 's quite an increase i don 't understand why we 're giving money for research and implementation of carbon neutral initiatives so aren 't we just giving them money to host an event we 're getting quite complicated in what we deem as a successful investment of our money right so we just want to put money towards getting people into the city so i 'm confused by the breakdown i don 't like how big the increase is i don 't think it 's justified going from 25 to 70 is fine going from 25 to 135 i think is is quite a jump uh through the ceo to the gm if there 's uh anything to be responded to there you 're not okay right here um so if we were to support the amendment um what would we be for going what would the implications be uh so if we were to support the amendment uh based on the original recommendation before the deferral of one of the elements in this summary we are actually expanding in all our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we were to increase by the additional 65 000 that would need to be considered in potentially other programs depending on the outcome for the deferred motion or the deferred item so to come from somewhere else something else would miss out okay anyone else wish to speak for the amendment anyone else wish to speak against the amendment sorry about that thanks lord mayor um as i said it 's a great event and completely on point with our theme i think you know just noting again that the city my understanding is we 're not proceeding with a winter festival this year i know the cost of that was in excess of i think 800 000 last year correct me if i 'm wrong so i think this is a great opportunity to build on an existing event make it bigger and better than ever and show the community that we 're there to support them particularly when they 're creating events that are bespoke for our city and on theme thanks councillor angie so we will now put the amendment to the vote uh all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councillor bevan those against is councillor lisa councillor goblet lord mayor deputy lord mayor and councillor fleet and so that has been to i and councillor where i 'll counsel the coast sitting over there councillor sorry uh and councillor co is again yes so that 's defeated two two six so we go back to the substantive motion uh now and that was moved by council government lord man can i make an amendment to the motion as well i don 't know whether i foreshadow that after after this or you can make an amendment amendment now okay thanks um so i 'm not sure the best way to put it but i 'd like to make an amendment to um i 'd like to amend item h the rslwa for anzac day 2022 so the amendment would be that council rejects the officer 's recommendation to item h and supports the applicant 's original request that the council asked the applicant to use best endeavours to demonstrate inclusion and equity considerations including engagement of aboriginal and torres strait islanders peoples thank you we need a seconder on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the amendment is that anzac day is one of the most revered and long-standing items on our perth calendar and it 's well known the event is aligned with the national agenda as a city we should be respectful of the sanctity of this important event and encourage inclusivity not dictate it by a cash carrots i think there 's a large amount of value in providing in-kind support as well because mass participation events in perth are quite difficult with traffic management etc by supporting the applicant the applicant 's original request we 're going to be providing 98 400 xgst in cash which is no different to the cash component that the city has already offered but we will be providing fifty one thousand dollars or fifty one thousand six hundred dollars in in-kind support sorry uh deputy lord mayor can i ask you to clarify point two uh is the minute takers um just coming up to speed with that that the council asked the applicant to use best endeavors to demonstrate equity diversity and inclusion considerations including engagement of aboriginal and torres strait islanders people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got this right so point one was rejects the officer 's recommendation and supports the applicant 's original request a point two ask the applicant to use best endeavors to demonstrate equity diversity and inclusion considerations and then i think i think we just want to be clear on the amounts of cash that we 're talking here versus in kind or otherwise so the amount of cash that the rsl requested was 98 400 xgst and the incline support was 51 600 so we would actually be ten thousand dollars better off in cash but um in our total event sponsorship obviously we 're offering um in kind so that 's 50 000 in kind right that 's effectively the difference yeah is that right yeah okay um okay thank you uh so councillor bain has spoken to it uh councillor bevin nothing further to add thank you thank you does anybody wish to speak against ask a question first certainly um so just on the initial um condition around the 10 000 conditional on the delivery have we ever done that to any other applicant ceo if i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law man not that i 'm aware of anybody wish to speak for the amendment against the amendment any further well i might just ask a question same question that i asked um last time on uh councillor angie 's amendment so what would be the implications here uh general manager or ceo if the additional contribution came in through the lord mayor it would be the same as the previous query there would be an impact and we would need to find it from another program depending on the decision for the deferred item as well and maybe you could help us better understand in kind versus cash because it would be easy to assume i might assume that i will link kinds in kind it 's not actually money so but you 're saying it does have an impact yes thank you through you lord mayor we answered this as a direct question in the agenda briefing session noting that estimated city fees are an actual cost to the city for facilitating events so it 's elements such as waste management cleaning of facilities power usage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to illustrate sponsorship support for an actual cost to ratepayers thank you thank you okay are there any uh further questions or anyone else wish to speak uh question as a counselor question yeah so the cash component that goes out the door on the original motion was a hundred thousand the amendment 's now ninety eight thousand four hundred so there 's a reduction in the funds that go to the applicant so we don 't need to find anything how does the city reconcile 51 600 in in kind being need needed to have been found from another pot of money to pay ourselves general manager through the lord may my understanding sorry i can 't see the screen from here so my understanding was it was a hundred thousand dollars cash plus an in-kind uh support for fifty thousand is that correct that was the original request yep yeah well that 's what it says here total amount requested 98 000 cash and 51 600 in kind sorry there 's a difference between 100 000 and 98 000. that 's it that 's true yes yes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if i can clarify the original request is for 150 000 so the funding request was 150 000 of which there was 98 000 cash and 51 600 in kind so in terms of our recommendations we just provide the one figure which putting up was a hundred thousand plus ten thousand for support for the initiative and the engagement so in terms of the final figure if i 'm if i 'm reading what you 're saying in terms of the in-kind plus the cash component is 150 000. so so the option just clarifies you could say a hundred thousand dollars cash and leave it at that or the 98 400 whatever you like to do but at the moment the submission that 's been put forward represents an actual cost for the rsl of ninety eight thousand four hundred dollars cash they would like plus they would also like in-kind support for fifty one thousand six 600 um this may have been answered last week but i just want some clarity to be reminded around this uh i note that we gave 65 82 95 000 85 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that amount has increased each year going back to 2016 2017 my understanding with a hundred thousand dollars for 20 20 21 was that money was paid but then anzac day did not happen was there any reimbursement of any of that money thank you lord mayor it was actually at the time we had donation was an element we could have under our policy so the anzac day for 21 20 no 21 was a hundred hundred thousand dollars cash as just a straight donation so because it was a donation there were no expenses expended because the date was cancelled uh the event was cancelled there was no transfer of funds to rsl for last year 's event so we didn 't give that money no we did not they didn 't get that money okay all right are there any sorry i 'm just i 'm confused on the 51-600 so what is the breakdown that the city is saying that we need to now go away and find other money from other pools you mean cash no no no to pay for the 51 600 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because then we 'll be able to work out if a ceo oh yes i think what we 're talking about is really the fees and other charges and so that would be a draw down from our operational budget in the main so at the minute with these programs we cost these for full transparency so the general manager is suggesting it will represent a cost whether that means it comes off another actual cash sponsorship that 's not the case it 's the cost so it won 't come off another sponsorship to pay for the 51 600. not necessarily can i still no because i haven 't seen what it is what uh what 's the 51 600 so in the paper for in-kind what what is it i suspect um and i general manager would you like me to guess at this well through the lord mayor the event itself includes the dawn service in king 's park which is at king 's park is obviously under the state authority but there 's a gunfire breakfast at governor 's house anzac day parade would have significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commemorative service at perth concert hall so there would be a component through there so the inc so in kind are we talking traffic management waste so so the traffic so they submissions as a sponsorship they sit down with our activity approvals team and work through what their estimates are the reason we just put a dollar figure and say this is the amount we 're supporting you and the determination of the in-kind is because those arrangements may change and as we have learned by saying here is the value of the dollars that we provide sometimes they may find ways that minimize city fees and by doing that they 're not penalised for example okay okay are there any further questions or does anybody wish to speak for or against the amendment counselor angie i just had a question because just looking through the prior years so 1789 and 20 and it 's you know gone up here was there a contribution of in-kind in that vicinity of 50 grand in previous years or you in that tally that summary table is that the total uh through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of those ones prior were cash donations there was no in-kind element thank you can i ask a question sure if we gave them a cash donation were they still using power were they still creating waste were they still creating road issues and did we send them a bill gm ah thank you lord mayor yes they would have paid the city for whatever fees they used so in effect the dollars that we 're providing would have been used for the event and if any fees were were charged then they would have paid that through all of their event fees so yes they paid the city fees and that would have come out of the 100 000 donation but we don 't know what those fees are i 'm assuming no so uh anyone else for or against we should speak uh no further questions so deputy lord mayors close out thank you very much um i think the provision of services like cleaning toilets picking up waste etc etc is the cost of doing business in a capital city um i i think that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's made up of a lot of volunteers and this is their major event in our calendar i think we should be proud to be having them in the city and i think that we should be supporting them to the extent that we can and i 'm not sure that we should be dictating to them how they should run their events but by using cash carrots as i like to call them but we should be encouraging them to be more aligned with our objectives and values thanks thank you uh deputy vlogmas i 'll put that to a vote now this is the amendment that is going to invite all those in favor so that is a councillor gobert councillor co the deputy lord mayor councillor bevan and councillor fleeton all those against that 's councillor lisa councillor angie and the lord man we 'll declare the amendment past five three five three okay so we return now to this so return to the substantive measure council government has spoken so uh anyone else wish to speak for

doing free parking um from 25 to 30 june um and i 'm looking at mr ahern here um so we 're not going to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that period of time would it be possible to work out what that liability is for that period of time for the bays that we 're we 're giving up we 're not going to do that now but it would be very interesting to know um that liability that we can 't pay but we still have to pay for the state anyway so it 's you know foregoing income for us but we still have to pay the tax bill uh ceo thank you councillor um i think it 's fair to say we can do some modeling on that but equally if those bays have been used during the day it could be suggested that they that day usage is actually providing the cover for the levy so not as uh it will directly impact our revenue but we would anticipate and hope that the usage during the day would cover that off could i invite the general manager though commercial services to add if i have not explained that sufficiently through the chair uh thank you ceo the ability for us to calculate that will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at night time there are less already visiting our car parks so most of the values

put this motion to the vote all those in favor that is carried unanimously thank you 15 3 also extracted for debate local government act reform city of perth submission and i would like to put an alternate so i would like to put an alternate motion which i will read as follows one that council supports the six local government reform themes in principle two the council requests the minister for local government deferred drafting of legislation for six months to allow the department of local government sport and cultural industries to provide the necessary information and detail to make an informed and considered comment on the proposed reforms and three in the event that the minister declines the proposed deferral then we support the recommendation of the submission 15 3a that 's the attachment 15 3a so contained i 'll say that again support the recommendations contained within the attachment 15 3a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last two and a half years implementing the recommendations of the inquiry into the city of perth at a cost of 8.5 million dollars to rate payers further reform is going to come at a cost to the rate payer and there has been a heavy burden there already as you know in supporting the six local government reform themes in principle we 're not suggesting that these aren 't going to serve a purpose but it does feel prudent to just allow a little bit of time for the work to be done properly and for the existing reform to seep in or sink in the local government sector also has been under review since at least 2016. the sector needs reassurance that proposed reforms will result in positive outcomes the most recent reforms included in 2021 as we mentioned are still being embedded and although i support the principles there is no detail that enables a proper response as yet we do want to support the minister and his ambitions for local government i told him as much but we do need that detail to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are proposing requesting the minister defer and seek more detail from his department we want um to be part of this reform to make it and ensure its success and for those reasons i am seeking elected members support in supporting this alternate motion uh councillor gobert thank you lord man the devil is in the detail as they say and having been i think something like 27 years in in the making getting to this point i think it 's important that we thrash out and understand the implications of every decision that 's going to be that is proposed as part of the new local government act um the i think the concerns may largely lie in a number of issues that for the most part related to a bureaucratic setup early intervention powers the local government monitor conduct panel a review of penalties rapid card resolutions the vexatious complaint referrals simplifying approvals for small business and community events which is particularly relevant within our community standardizing meeting procedures including public question time the chief executive officer key performance indicator is being published community and stakeholder engagement charters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods and the ceo recruitment period i think there 's a few things within those recommendations that i would say need to be looked into with a bit more detail and it 's important that we as you said quite rightly have all the information to make a fully informed decision so with that i 'm quite happy to support the alternate motion thank you thanks councilman does anybody wish to speak against the alternate motion councillor clayton thanks lord man um i 'm happy with points one and two but not happy to support what we 're putting forward because the minister will most likely just say sorry we 're pressing ahead i don 't want to spend council time now going through every single one of the items but there 's several positions that the city 's proposed here that i don 't support so if i can request that we split out the motion and vote on each item separately because i do want to indicate my support for one and two but certainly not supporting the third item okay so um we will split them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to ask if anybody else wishes to speak yes counselor government a question lord man yeah um in the event that um recommendations one and two are supported but recommendation three is not does that leave the city then without a position to take to the state government if the effect of to understand supported yeah good question ceo yes it would mean that the city wouldn 't have a stated position in relation to the actual recommendations as is contained in the proposed reform okay thank you so we 're going to is anybody else that wishes to speak for or against one i think yeah counselor loser um thank you lord mayor i i worry that that without the the level of detail that you 're asking for and indeed councillor gobert has asked for as well that we are unable to really uh provide proper comment back to the department and from my layperson 's reading of a lot of it it does seem like we 're putting more bureaucracy where we don 't we 're where the in fact the stated aim is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so i 'm wholly supportive of of your three motions thank you okay so anything else on one point one four against okay so we 're going to do the debate in total uh so is anybody else for or against any of it councillor so i i concur with councillor fleeton um i think item was gone from the screen now but item one and two are fine um i think we 're being a bit naive about how much impact we 'll actually have on the end result so even if we have a stated position um it might go some way to informing it the the six local government reform themes in principle i think we um i think they 're great and um i don 't i don 't actually don 't have a huge amount of issues but i do have an issue with the way the administration has formed our response to it okay yes thanks count uh ceo thanks t.i thank you very much much uh lord mayor i think just to answer that so the template was provided to us by welga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fair to say that the city obviously with very limited information has provided input but for most of those matters that have been unsupported by the city it is because the detail is lacking for us to really make an informed decision so i would just like to make the point that the city has responded to what was before it but those that are not supported is purely because there was no detail provided can i ask a question is who wrote up that information because it 's got um kylie johnson i think as the officer in charge of the uh report but my understanding was brad silence well my first um interaction with it was from someone else yeah sure ceo uh yes so uh mr salence was the executive director at the time and uh responsible for bringing the responses together it the responses have been drawn from across the organization from the relevant areas although predominantly it is a governance-based document i 'm not certain why kylie johnson 's names on anything sorry so we 're still speaking for or against so anyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i just had a question because we were provided with the opportunity to provide feedback so i 'm just asking was the feedback of elected members taken on board in the drafting ceo yes anyone else for or against my points in my introductory remarks so we 're voting on point one all those in favor that 's carried unanimously uh point two all those in favor that is also carried unanimously and point three all those in favor so we have council lisa councillor angeli councillor gobert councillor co the lord mayor council of bevin those against uh deputy lord mayor bain and councillor fletan point three is past five two six two sixteen sixteen passing thank you everybody slow on the math 16 16 1 extracted absolute majority required review of council policy 1.2 professional development would anyone like to move a motion to deal with this item thank you council loser second to councillor co um councillor lisa councillor co anybody against four uh we 'll put that to the vote all those in favor that 's carried unanimously thank you 16-2 16-2 has been withdrawn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that now uh 2 new council policy 2.16 complaints management uh counselor question to start with sure so this came to sorry um move it and seconder and then we can have the questions uh so could we have a mover to deal with this motion please thanks councillor governor seconder thank you deputy lord mayor bain uh councillor gobert before you speak was there a ques you need us right counselor so this who 's second hand counselor um so this came to policy committee councillor gordon made some very good suggested amendments it was quite a big bit of work that she 'd put forward i don 't see anything in the agenda paper around the context of the of the change so i just want to understand the city 's understood what council gordon have said it 's replicated in the proposed policy because usually we get a summary in the agenda paper saying this was the context this is what happened additional information was provided and this is the outcome thank you councillors when we ask questions at the abs the answer gets put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's my understanding but i 'm going to actually ask the general manager of corporate services to answer more specifically i do recall that counselor gordon was suggesting that it might have been overly complicated um but i don 't know that we necessarily reduced any of the elements based on specific feedback but if i could invite the um through the lord mayor the general manager corporate services thank you general manager what 's that microphone the conversation being specific to the complaints management policy for the city there were discussions more broadly about other aspects of um the items that night but i don 't actually recall there being a specific set of comments relating to feedback on this specific policy thanks general manager number of policies that were actually um deferred to come to a further meeting but this was not one of them councillor fleeting would they be in relation to the um council member behavioural complaints policy so they 're two completely separate policies yes they 're separate yes there 's separate documents no yeah this is not about council 's account thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion that we deal with it at this meeting that item is it not here because it 's not ready or the motion was to consider at the march ocm right okay yeah that 's fine as long as it 's not woven into this and it 's that 's fine thank you thanks for clarifying thanks councillor clayton so uh councillor gobert i don 't wish to close that uh and councillor bye um deputy lord mayor bye no i 'm good all good um let 's put it to the vote all those in favor that 's carried unanimously thanks everyone so item number 16 3 on block that is the city of perth governance framework 16-4 also on block review of council policy 3.2 affordable housing 17 motions of which notice has been given and no notices of motion this have been received 18 matters for which the meeting may be closed councillor catherine lisa has disclosed a proximity interest in the following item 18.1 and is required to leave the chamber prior to council considering the item thanks councillor lisa any councillors have questions on confidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the public if there are no questions or debates we can vote on the item publicly are there any questions one question as soon as we pass this is the resolution public did we have to close it before we ask that question i think it 's good okay so i think at this point the advice from governance is that we closed the meeting at this point uh so we have a mover for that thanks councillor ko welcome to the party councillor gobert seconder all those in favor that 's unanimous okay so we 'll close the meeting yeah uh live stream goes off maker crowd at home devastated council laser welcome back we 're on item 19 urgent business there 's one item of urgent business that i have consented to being considered at this meeting regarding the city of perth 's new municipal brand um would anybody like to move a motion to deal with this item thanks councillor fleeton i do have a seconder i will counsel the laser thank you seconder uh councillor fleeton so just very proud to be part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together on saturday night um it got a great reception from every stakeholder that was there um i like the story and the effort behind it um and it 's a great way to kick off what we 're doing in the future so thanks for all of your work lord mayor and the ceo and the team thanks council of clayton councillor lisa thank you lord mayor just to say that the um it 's it appeared that it was true community consultation to come up with this brand and i 'm i 'm proud to it it 's been done on our watch thank you thanks council is it anybody wish to speak against anyone else wish to speak for i 've get something to say i 'd like to speak for it because i like the brand but next time i thought i think we should get the drones to make the shape of the new brand wouldn 't that be a launch can i say so so we were we were a few we 're a few hundred jones short of that that was there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were two things that we were hoping that was one of them the second one was the qr code technology which would have enabled people who were there to put their phone up the drones make a qr code like we 've been swiping in with and then the phone registers the qr code made by the drones and then would have taken you to the city of perth landing page and then all of the story would have burst open we 're about 55 drones short i think and as much as i was pushing behind the scenes uh yeah nice so our next incarnation will do all of those things and hopefully a whole lot more but thank you i 'll just add my comments thanks to the administration for sensing the urgency and realizing the opportunity that we had with the 60th anniversary and pushing along to get the result that we did it 's um the feedback 's been excellent and i know in this space you don 't always get a universally positive feedback but we 've had very very good feedback so i appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councillor gobert thank you lord mayor i think this will definitely be something to be looking back on in years to come and be very proud of i think the creative concept behind how this came about and the stories that have been told in the image that we are now using on all of our materials is very well resolved and i think that the more people come to understand that in in the future the more that they 'll be embracing of it and run with it so thank you thanks councillor governor uh council fleet was there anything uh we will put this to the vote all those in favor carried unanimously thank you everybody uh item 20 is closure there being no further business i will now declare the ordinary council meeting closed at 6 21 pm thank you very much everybody could you please all rise for the right honourable the lord mayor of perth mr basil zimples thank you you"

this time last year when we came along and gave a deputation and welcome to those who weren 't here last year i 'd like to thank you once again for allowing us to present our make smoking history targa west which we believe is a truly unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be our 18th year running tiger west and it 's been run in the city of perth in one form or another from the very beginning and it 's a privilege to be able to run a motorsport event in the middle of a capital setting targa west is owned by myself and my wife with david smith behind her has worked for us and a few other contractors assisting with pr and social media when required and we also contract team leaders to set up the city of perth stage and the displays on langley park in the city of perth family zone we 've been very fortunate to have worked there one way or another through the last two years in addition to the four-day target west we run 12 competition events a year from albany pemberton to bunbury and the perth motorplex in addition we organize over 20 displays and other functions through the year from a few cars through to many hundred cars targa west is a national level tarmac rally held under the auspices of motorsport australia and approved by local governments and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of railing is the competition targa west has been far greater than that with hundreds of competitors and their service crews 500 officials and thousands of spectators over the four daters is one of the biggest weekends of motorsport in wa but what else it brings is the social capital of bringing people together either within the comp competitors teams officials and just importantly bringing people out of the homes to come to the city to enjoy the spectacle and colour sounds and vibrancy and motorsport action and static vehicle display targa west is a four-day event that is based in the city in perth but also takes place in wyman park city of swan in ellenbrook ballsbrook and malaga city of kalamunda on mundaring royal road in the zigzags and in the main street of haines street the shire of mundaring and parkerville shy of turjo in four different areas and the shy of chittering and the lower of chittering not many events would be spread over such an area and we promote it as perth as perth in the surrounding areas the best part of target west that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the activities and displays being completely free for the spectating public to attend the celebration of motorsport and the shannon 's classic on the swan vehicle display including the city of perth family zone on langley park are free for participants showing off their cars bikes and carts within the city of perth we run a pre-event promotion in murray street mall this year will be on thursday the 12th of august this is always well received by the passing foot traffic and those out on their lunch breaks we have our accommodation rally headquarters at the hyatt hotel for five days and last year we planned to start the event in supreme court gardens but last minute changes were due to the waterlogged gardens and we moved to the start to the frontal hyatt hotel and it turned out to be successful our application to the city of perth is to repeat the start of the hyde hotel where all the crews are based and we 'll be inviting the lord mayor along or its representative to be the official starter the big change for this year that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shine that has been a north bridge on the friday evening for 17 years and and we wish to make the change for this year last year we checked out forest place on a friday evening and concluded they would make an ideal location with late night shopping bringing a more family-friendly orientated crowd we 're very impressed when we came in and middle it was just before christmas with the food vans but the mix of office work is staying behind and the shop has created a great atmosphere the show in china is a crowd favourite the 60 plus rally cars are on display from 6 pm to 9 pm for the public to get up close to them while the crews the sport teams and officials take advantage of the cafes and restaurants within the area we are proposing to utilise murray street and hay street malls as an all day show and shine in the lead up to the rally cars arriving the extra displays could be something like hot rods and street machines or exotic cars most of which we could only dream of potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do in shopping centers but we believe we can turn the city centre into a motor show for the whole day on the sunday we turn langley park and the terrace road car park into a massive display of cars and competition where the celebration of motorsport is a unique motorsport display on langley park showcasing over 400 vehicles representing all forms of motorsport including speedway circuit racing motorbike motocross jet boats go-carts historic racing off-road drag cars and remote control cars and even soap boxes the shannon 's classic on the swan is the car display on the grass area between riverside drive and the swan river from or around 600 metres that joins the event into the belltown elizabeth key precinct um precinct with approximately 300 classic and contemporary vehicles on display and around 40 different car clubs involved we have a city of perth family zone on langley park has activities for all ages including fun games and driving simulators there 's plenty of food vans and seating to make an enjoyable day out on langley park we also run another event at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those who haven 't entered the four-day target west it starts and finishes on riverside drive and goes through the terrace road car park and it 's limited to 60 cars that event runs from 9am to 12 30 on the sunday and after the target city sprint concludes the makes making history target west rise from malaga to compete on the stage this is the finale to the rent with competitors having one last chance to make up time to move up the outright standings and at the end of target west competition we had the champagne presentation the winners of the different categories on riverside drive providing a great photo opportunity of the podium and the city of perth skyline the end of the event is the city of perth gala presentation at the hyatt hotel on the sunday evening evening a representative from the city of perth will be invited to represent to present the trophies to the winning crews activities on langley park and riverside drive include 120 competition cars and 180 competitors 600 display vehicles on display for approximately 5 800 participants 20 food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day and an estimated 25 000 visiting various event elements held within the city of perth all as this is promoted on 96 fm through an extensive social media and pr campaigns that last year generated activity including the gwn seven years seven channel seven news the nine years including three live crosses to the weather newspapers including features in the weekend west radio interviews social media including 63 000 video views 67 000 engagements and over 1.4 million impressions and this year will contract culture accounts to get an accurate figure on how many people attend the different parts of the event in the city of perth and the social economic benefits of those visits and finally thank you to the city of perth for opportunity of bringing motorsport right into the heart of perth and enabling us to provide an event free for people of all ages and backgrounds to attend we hope targo west can continue to contribute to well-rounded calendar events that appeal to a broad cross-section of the community thank you ross thank you i appreciate uh appreciate those words i might just see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to ask yes counselor lisa thank you lord man thank you ross um i love the tiger west i should declare that um with the friday night event coming into forest chase do you have a feeling for how many cars might be there well there 'll certainly be the full field of tiger west cars which each year is around about 60 cars but we 've been talking to the event team within the city of perth and they 've said what else we can do and our belief is if we could maybe make something that will last all day in the hay street mall and the murray street mall we 're potentially looking at moving up to king street but i think we take one step at a time and if we can make something work this year we 'll look at what we can do in the future and that when we walked around we noticed how much eating area or cafes restaurants hotels were up by king street which is the main eating area on a friday night so we 'd like to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future if we can make this year work as successful as we plan to thanks councillor thank you ross deputy lord mayor hello thank you very much that was a wonderful deputation do you have any plans for electric vehicles we do and i didn 't ask you to ask me that there 's one electric vehicle that 's competing has been competing in targa west for some years and if you 've been watching your news uh was it before christmas just after christmas um the people who are behind that car have set up the electric highway out on the nullarbor and that was all developed because of target west which we 're very proud about and the promotion that those guys doing go worldwide with because the world is looking at what they 're doing including over overseas sorry over east who came out of the nullarbor to see that car or the electric part of the electric charging part which runs on the charges runs on reused um chip oil from cooking the chips which generates runs the generator which runs the car so effectively it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have one car that does targa west which is fully caged car and we have um two other cars that intermittently come and compete in our lower level events and hopefully we can get them to compete in the target city sprint and we also have uh the guys who compete competed there 's the telstra owners tesla takeiva yeah something like that deceiver which is the tesla owner is an electric vehicle owner 's car club and they come along and put a display on on langley park as well as part of the celebration of motorsport what do you think of tesla owners just um just out of interest ross do you find them slightly unusual or a bit different all right anything um the guys we deal with we couldn 't be more than happy with uh good answer that they are like even the guys we deal with say about tesla owners that they 're different because they started the electric vehicle things but i 'm a firm believer that the electric vehicle is is the way of the future and some of my die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not real motorsport um and and the guy drives the tesla says um yes but horses still race as in referring to the fact that the horses of the motor transport a hundred years ago so petrol engines will be around for a long time yet um the future is certainly some other form of way of driving these cars whether it 's electricity or batteries or helium under hydrogen sorry we 'll just have to wait and see thank you ross um very well answered um is there anything else ross thank you we appreciate it uh thank you both for being here david thank you very much good on you thanks guys uh we will um a reminder that uh questions of the administration in relation to this item uh please reserve these until the item is tabled for questions thanks to ross and david we 're going to move on to item six on the agenda disclosures of interest seo if we got any uh received here yes lord mayor councillor lisa has declared a proximity interest in relation to item 18.1 as the perth concert hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jointly owns thanks ceo are there any disclosures of interest from the floor councillors i should uh disclose interest in that one as well being on the board for theater trust okay thank you it could bring a flood of hands councillor angie thanks councillors thank you deputy lord man uh all noted can i also declare another interest sure um i couldn 't work out how to say this but it 's in item 12.3 confidential attachment person one he 's a person they then they are a person who is known to me okay thank you no further disclosures thanks everybody um item seven to ten will be dealt with at the ordinary council meeting next week we 'll move to reports then as we move through the reports i 'll ask uh if any councillors have questions in relation to the items nothing under 11 12 is community development alliance reports uh they 're uh questions received from councillor fleet and this is the event sponsorship 2021-2022 round two council of clayton um thanks lord just want to clarify something in the city 's response on page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covert 19. but does that mean if there 's actually a health directive to cancel it or if the organization thinks it 's just too hard to do ceo and if i could ask the general manager community development to answer any questions related to this item through the chair in terms of the provisions i can provide the exact ones in the funding arrangements but we try and work proactively with postponements wherever feasible so we take a very pragmatic and partnership approach in how we can resolve matters so there is a degree of discretion but certainly as we 've said here we use milestone payments and we also use our normal acquittal process to try and mitigate that risk thank you uh general manager yes councillor angie yeah i 've got a question given that um you know there is a high chance that some events will have to be cancelled this year are we considering that in or is the panelists considering that in their assessment of applications this year so for example um i guess looking more kindly i suppose on outdoor events and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general manager uh through the chair in terms of the provisions for setting up the events there are components like coveted arrangements that are now part of our event information so that is provided whether that 's internal and you 'll note in some of the a response applicant from the forums that people have put in requests for additional coverage mitigations for example so we take all that information on board yes councilor angie yeah i 'm not sure if that completely answered the question i guess what i want to understand is if the panels i guess is an administrative matter so if you can 't answer it so be it but have the criteria been tweaked given that we 're operating in a completely different environment this year thanks andy uh jim we 're taking each application on merit based on not knowing what the circumstances will be as the year unfolds are there any other questions from any of the partner counselors i 've got a question um in relation to r s l w a for anzac day 2022 i notice um 100 100 000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delivery of equity diversity and inclusion considerations including engagement of aboriginal and torres strait islander peoples can i just seek some clarity on this so i remember what happened last year and um there was a blow up if you like around the flying of the aboriginal flag and also the welcome to country i think there was a position from the rsl that position was later changed but then of course there was no anzac day service because of the coveted conditions so that ten thousand dollars specifically is uh is that what we that scenario that i just described is that what we are looking to ensure is part of the program of events by stipulating that ten thousand dollars separately to the gm of communities through the chair yes that is effectively we want to work in partnership once the decision by council is made to look at all types of opportunities whether that 's a welcome to country or any other arrangements that may demonstrate inclusion and diversity we did note in our recommendation rationale that the application demonstrated minimal consideration for the level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for putting the ten thousand dollars separately uh with the aim to work with the group thank you thank you uh and i guess just on anzac day um so if anzac day were not to happen um does that ma what happens to the money as it is through through the chair as it is a over ten thousand dollar funding we put in milestone payments so we work with the groups to make sure that we mitigate as much as possible we do ask the organizations to be pragmatic and if changes happen we ask them to demonstrate what have been sunk costs that can 't be recovered so we do ask them to take a proactive approach in trying to recover any costs that they are able to do so okay thanks julian cheers um any other questions from any councillors council clayton thank you so on anzac day we know the dates you know the date so it 's 100 grand or 110 depending on what they do what what are the sunk costs you know last year it was cancelled i 'd imagine a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are we going to transfer 100 to them the moment we pass this so how 's it going how 's it going to work gm through the chair we can provide you with details of the milestone payments we did last time and certainly as we do each funding agreement we have learnings from what was done previously so looking at each arrangement is bespoke we will do so again when we get to the milestone payments for these recommendations just one more quickly sorry if they say no to the 10 000 then we 're gonna pay a hundred thousand and they don 't have to do the welcome to country they can do whatever they want uh correct through the chair that is the the way that the recommendation is framed all right well hopefully they 'll uh understand what the intention of that is that 's right are there any further questions councillor bevan siri thank you lord mayor um item g uh should the dates be 22 rather than 21 on the projected date oh the uh 20 page 21. the last 2122 it says the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are there other local government contribution or other government agency contributions to this event sure so i think 21 is wrong isn 't it what year are we in 22 yeah so that should be 22 i can answer that there you go uh general manager for the rest for the details of the funding from external bodies i can find out what was put in the application and provide that through separately okay thank you thank you are there any further questions councillors okay thank you we 'll move then to a 13 infrastructure and operations alliance reports 13 one is the variation to contract double zero seven five slash two one safety bollard installation uh council fleet and i know you had a question answered satisfactorily any councillors have any further questions there no thank you 14 is corporate service alliance reports corporate services rather brought in one monthly financial report and council fleeton i notice a number of questions there sorry thanks page five uh i think it 's number six around the separate cibn on the carbon offset program is that in drafting now or i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so just an expected date on that would be great please sure so uh under the uh instruction from the ceo all questions to the uh are we coming to you on that one like uh then first time around okay no it 's paid yes yeah six sorry yeah that 's question number five is that the one counselor oh it 's six in my list but it 's on page five yeah it 's the cibn on the carbon offset program in the parking business yes all right ceo so if i could ask the general manager commercial services to answer that or any other questions related to that matter thank you ceo through the chair in consultation with the chief financial officer we 'll prepare the cibn um and we 'll look to be completing that by the end of next week excellent thank you thanks nathan is there anything further there yeah if i can just on the list uh question 11 on page seven with the interest rates so the answer states interest rates were not forecast to go up at all during this financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in interest rates since july so to the city is that what the bank 's offering us so interest rates haven 't moved it 's just the bank doesn 't want our money is that right so yeah if i could ask the our chief financial officer michael kent to answer that question thank you very much through the chair that is entirely correct counselor it relates to the rates that the banks are prepared to offer us okay thank you thank you michael any further questions from any councillors or council of clayton okay thank you councillors uh 14 2 schedule of accounts paid november 2020 yeah i 'm so sorry i was flicking through my pages could i just quickly ask a question on page 11 of the answers that we 've got here sure which is point 23 um regarding the jackson mcdonald dog prosecution [Music] so in one of the answers it says that the legal spend is not currently divided by alliances some matters a multi-alliance or whole of city um so well if that 's the case can we get a breakdown of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice please ceo uh yes we 'll provide that thank you one last one yeah sure page 11 just underneath so the the question to brand agency what was the work for and the answer doesn 't actually itemize that it 's just saying they 've been appointed for a two-year contract and their knowledge and understanding of the digital environment is not currently matched by the city 's new agency i just yeah want to know how much this is for so yeah if i could invite the acting executive director governance and strategy to answer that question through the chair the um the brand agency helped revamp the website and their knowledge and expectations of sitecore which is the platform that the website is on um was required by the city to ensure that um our support was provided in a timely manner thank you just one follow-up so we 've signed a new agreement for them for 5 500 a month for two years is that correct that is correct so how are we going to upskill the agency that we approved last year if we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to stay with the agency that we were with before through the chair i 'd have to take that one on notice that 's it thanks can i ask a question to clarify council clayton 's inquiries we were told we had a panel and we could accept work from a production implementation creative services and production implementation panel but now we seem to still have other agencies that we 're continually paying how does that work are we in breach of our procurement our own procurement policy roman back to you through the chair with regard to payment policy brand agency was um used a unique supplier exemption as part of the process given the fact that they had expertise that other organizations did not have um that was done i 'd have to find out take on notice when when that process went through okay thank you yeah thank you thank you bronwyn uh any further questions okay we 're off to 14-2 schedule of accounts about november 2021 there were no questions received on this item have we got any from the room thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one anybody have anything thank you 14 4 schedule of accounts paid december 20 21 any questions on this item counsellors 14 5 mid-year statutory budget review any questions on this item counsellors 14-6 is the corporate business plan quarterly report two council legion i know there were three questions from you have they been answered to your satisfaction uh yes thank you lord mayor thank you any further questions from any councillors item 15 chief executive officer reports 15 one is local government act reform city of perth submission are there any questions from any councillors on this item all right okay uh yes council loser sorry lord mayor the question really is not so much about the content of the briefing but who do we share this information with after let 's assume it 's approved next week at the meeting who then gets this information are we sharing it with volga are we sharing with other local councils who are we sharing this information with thank you thanks for the question council laser ceo so this information will be provided to the department and also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's announcement of this particular reform package in the meantime i 'm meeting with the ceo of volga and also the executive director of the department of local government cultural industries and sport thank you follow up there 's no plan is are you also talking to our local other councils around us about the content of our submission i haven 't anticipated having conversations with the other local governments my understanding is that this template that we 've actually utilized is being utilized by every local government and um in the main i 've already had one conversation with the ceo of volga i think there 's a the vast majority of the recommendations according to olga they 're they 're supporting so i would imagine most of the other councils will probably support them as well um council lisa i was at the most recent inner city mayor 's gathering and it was raised amongst the mayors and ceos at the time and the feeling was there was some discussion about going in together but in the end there was enough there were enough differences of opinion on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that each council was a best place to do their own work and and that 's certainly reflective of what we 've done here are there any further questions yep you 're welcome um okay let 's go to 15-2 inquiry into the city of perth recommendations

    "text": "[Music] dylan 's our social media marketing unicorn and i 'm one of the founders of concept on we 've also got charlie in the room here as well the two of us started concept on we 're a branding agency essentially we help businesses generate more leads and convert more more of those leads and convert more upsells as well and we retain more customers as well ultimately all of this is to to help businesses get more revenue right and we do that through distilling that brand strategy that brand feeling you 'll probably be able to sort of see our branding throughout the presentation as well it 's fairly consistent this beautiful pink neon science and that 's by no mistake as well that 's kind of where our expertise lies and then we also then sort of extrapolate that through web design through logo design other graphic design as well and then through organic social media marketing too which is what we 're going to be talking about today we 're here to really talk about how you guys as business owners or people that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media in a more efficient way to actually get results can i just get a quick show of hands who here 's a business owner yeah one for starting a business cool great and and who here is managing social media marketing for their employer great who here has not had anything to do with social media at all doesn 't know how to use facebook good good because you 'd be in the wrong room it 's not that this is not that um cool i just wanted to get a bit of an idea of kind of who i 'm talking to as well and i know i 've spoken to a few of you out there uh really to understand what your problems are and what it is you 're hoping to learn from today so i do think that we can cover quite a bit it might feel a little overwhelming we 're sort of not talking about the the usual concepts of you know how to use facebook or anything like that we 're sort of more kind of going into the strategy side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelming just take some notes we can cover that sort of stuff afterwards as well in about two to six weeks time we 'll be turning this into like an e-book as well and you 'll be able to receive that too but there 'll be a download link that you should be able to receive hopefully by today or tomorrow in which case you can you 'd be able to download the actual presentation itself so look i guess the problem that we 've sort of found um in speaking to business owners the problem that i find isn 't that people don 't know how to use social media we all consume social media on a daily basis um we we sort of as business owners or as as managers of social media marketing we understand that we need to have social media but it was sort of a little bit lost on where to start you know what to post when to post it why am i posting it like what am i trying to achieve here and i think that that 's um it can it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what to post we don 't really know what 's actually going to try and move us in the right direction for our objectives for our goals as business owners or social media marketers we want to cover how you can use social media to grow your business and how you can streamline your social media process by posting the things that are relevant to your business and that send the right key messages that actually going to send the right communications to the right people right so let 's uh let 's start with some basics um can anyone tell me why you think a business would want to be on social media like just i know it seems like a basic question but what why do you think what do you think someone like a business owner would need to be on yes right yep to maybe sort of reach new customers right yeah yeah essentially interact with other businesses okay absolutely absolutely brand awareness yep sure absolutely yeah anyone else generate more sales ultimately we 're in business to do that yeah so i think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're right absolutely connecting with your audience so we are trying to build our network whatever whatever audience that might be as you know maybe other businesses other partners or you know potential customers as well right we also want to build trust in our brand so that 's the brand awareness side of things we want to increase the legitimacy that we have where you know it 's not just about um you know we 're there to sort of say hey we know what we 're talking about we actually sell this product or we sell this service and we 're good at what we do too right we 've got our finger on the pulse of the industry um and we 're knowledgeable we 're kind of the industry experts and it 's it 's not unlike actually what we 're doing here right now you know dylan and i are here standing here talking to you about social media and it 's legitimizing us as you know knowledgeable people that know a little bit about social media right and that this is no different when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your industry about your products and services you 're doing the same thing too reaching new audiences as well right so not just connecting with your audience on a more intimate level and starting a conversation but also reaching new people that you wouldn 't have otherwise seen right so if you 've got a cafe that 's on a street a busy street a lot of people walk past they know the cafe is there one street back one street forward they never walk past that street they 'll never hear us there right so it 's about trying to to go to a place that can start these conversations where those people might share that content and interact in a different way so that you can reach new people that are like-minded to the people already purchasing your product already have the problem that you 're trying to solve or that your product is trying to solve for them and last but not least ultimately we 're marketing our products and services you know we 're trying to say this is us this is what we do just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything we 're going to be covering today we 're going to start with social media strategies what are they why do you need one what can it do for your business then we 'll move on to the actual content side of things talking about what you can post and ultimately why you 're posting it and then finally we 're going to cover that content schedule you 've got in your laps um a bit of an oprah moment so here but we 'll give you a digital version of that so you don 't actually need to write anything down because that would be awful look let 's start with social media strategies famous guy winston churchill you guys might have heard of him great photo of him by the way our favorite he said a lot of famous stuff he did a lot of famous things one of my favorite things was fail to plan and you plan to fail and really i think as business owners you know we when we got into business i mean if you were already a part of the nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write a business plan right when you started your business you would have come up with planning we didn 't just make it up and then start doing some stuff we we probably wrote a few things down we might have had a meeting or two and brainstorming sessions and kind of said okay yeah what are we going to do what resources are we going to need how are we going to achieve these goals what goals do we have you know and really that 's what a social media strategy actually tries to achieve and there 's some core parts of the social media strategy which we 're going to cover off today social media strategies can be massive they can have a lot of stuff to them but really um you know what we want to cover in this section is really just some core basics to kind of the the minimum of what we might need to to really get more out of our social media so you know i think i think we can all agree that um that you know building a strategy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to essentially help us achieve our goals quicker with less waste of time as well unlike our personal accounts you know on a business account you can 't really just post anything you you know we want to be able to post something that is actually adding value to the brand that we 're trying to build and it 's not just um you know if we if we 're posting stuff about our personal life and about our very very cute adorable dogs or whatever it is it might be cool for us but other people you know might lose faith in the fact that you actually know what you 're doing and that you 're professional so posting anything may have a detrimental effect on on the brand itself and of the legitimacy and the trust that your business can solve their problem for your customer so without without planning you know social media can feel like quite a large task because we don 't really know where to start and it seems like uh we just um because it seems so big we end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into hard basket so social strategy is a bit like a bible it 's a one-stop shop tells you everything you need to know about organic marketing through social media so i just want to cover off what organic marketing is because i think we all are familiar with paid advertisement right which is where as a business we would pay um you know we 'd pay for advertising whether that be in a newspaper it could even be a billboard you know it could be a tv ad a radio ad or the google ads are really annoying facebook ads or even those really annoying ones that youtube have too all of that is paying someone to put a message in front of the audience right so it 's actually pushing that message across while organic is is a bit different what we 're trying to do is is is post some content that 's relevant to the to the customer they have a problem they want to try and solve it so they go and find out how they might be able to solve that problem and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or relevant to that customer they 're going to find it and then they 're going to interact with it and they 're going to start this relationship with your brand based on that so organic is where basically you 're posting content that your customer actually wants to see rather than kind of you know with paid advertising almost being forced to see it so with uh planning through a social media strategy it will it 'll give you an idea of what to post and when to post it who we 're trying to reach who our target market is who our potential customer is etcetera what our our objectives our business objectives and what our social media objectives as a result of that and also the message that we 're trying to convey as well the ideas what are the key messages what are we actually trying to say it covers way more than that but that 's kind of what we 're going to be getting into a little bit more today ultimately all of this ensures that we 're making good use of our time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make sure that our marketing efforts our social media marketing efforts are not wasted that they 're not um you know that they 're actually are going to help us move the business along to towards our business goals there are lots and lots of different aspects to a social media strategy uh today we 're just going to be talking about the main four that you kind of need uh to really fill this strategy out uh and so the first are objectives which is what you 're actually trying to achieve on social media the second are your key messages which is what you 're trying to communicate to your audience through socials target audience are who you 're trying to communicate to i 'm sure you all kind of have an idea of who your target audience is already but we 'll go more into that and channel strategy is simply just what platforms what social media apps you 're going to use to target that audience so we 're going to go through each of these individually now but first this is just kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to talk a bit about this yeah this is a social media strategy that we 've delivered for a client look it 's a some 30-odd page document and this is kind of what we build it 's our bread and butter but it covers a research component it covers different channel strategies here facebook instagram linkedin you know etc we 've got our business goals over here and what they would turn into with social media objectives too which we are going to be covering we 've got a section for hashtags too you know the ones that we 're actually going to be using so look that 's just an example of what it could look like that 's well designed to brand you know it 's it 's part of their brand as well so it really really looks um the part but um but as far as an actual strategy you know anything 's written down in a word document is perfectly fine as well so let 's start with objectives which are like i said what you 're trying to accomplish through your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure they actually meet the goals of your business um because there 's no point in having six billion followers and zero leads right we 're on social media to grow our business so whatever business goals you have broadly we 're going to try find a social media objective that matches that goal so for example if your broad business aspiration was to increase your brand awareness maybe in the short to midterm then you may be looking to grow your reach on social media that 's the amount of people who are seeing each of your posts and if you 're looking to grow your revenue then you 're obviously looking for people to go to your socials see your awesome products or services click through to your website and actually buy them which is the dream um so actually first do one of you guys want to give me a business business goal you have for your business come on i 'll pick on someone anyone all right yes thank you you want to have three new clients so if you 're looking to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social media objective might to be increase your click-through rate the amount of people who are going to your facebook being like this is cool i 'm going to click the message button and message this guy right so it 's all about finding the right objective to help your business and the reason why that is important of course is because we 're going to tailor our posts and we 're going to have call to actions at the end of the post that 's going to actually drive people to do what you want them to do so if we 're if our lead generation if our sales process if our sales funnel includes people that go to your website and that 's the best place for them to be able to find the content that they need in order to be able to go down that sales funnel and think yeah i want to purchase well then we want to make sure that the call to action on social media is check out our you know click here to etc right so it 's quite good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can actually tailor your call to actions around that yeah and this is to extend on that i guess this is you know we 're trying to think more about key messages here um which does tie into our call to actions as well can anyone tell me what a key message is abroad in sort of broad terms anyone broadly speaking key message is an idea that a brand is trying to get across to its audience is a consistent idea right so it 's not just one thing like we 're going to be closed at christmas it 's more just okay what are our what are some things although that is that is certainly a communication that we can use a key message more broadly is more of a general idea and usually consistent as well like hey we are eco-friendly or hey this is you know what we 're about this is kind of a problem we 're trying to solve etc they 're usually fairly consistent so when you 're starting to establish what your key messages are then that way we can actually then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself when we 're creating the actual text part of our social media posts um we 're sort of embedding those key messages in there obviously we 're dressing them up differently but ultimately it 's got those key messages in there what are the ideas we 're trying to get across you know are we a family friendly brand are we a fun jovial brand you know like what and you 'll see that as well we 've got some examples so why is it important well the messages need to resonate with your target market each person is different and we all have different values and we all respond to things in a different way and when we gear up our our posts that have these key messages in in them we 're actually trying to really resonate with that person on a on an emotional level to create that connection with them and then once we 've done that they 're more pliable to kind of um we 're more able to get them to do what we want them to do to click through to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate a lead or engage with us on social media so that we can start that conversation there as well so look you know and and really that you know us as individual consumers you know i know myself as well we all do business with people we trust the other day we like to spend money with people who trust um you know i can trust that that the coffee shop next door always makes a great coffee and that 's why i kept going back there that 's why i won 't you know have coffee in many other places because i know that they 're very good um and in that same way a lot of other consumers want to make sure that they 're you know that their problem is going to be solved that they are getting what they want consistently and in that way as well consistency is another really important buzzword too in any relationship even personal ones as well consistency breeds trust but what we often don 't recognize is that inconsistencies also breed distrust so it goes the other way and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business business has its opening hours on google and yet we go there and then not open right this is really annoying you go there again another time and the same thing happens we 're just going to stop going there because we just like well we don 't even know when they 're going to be open they 're just not it 's not consistent with anything that they 're saying i mean even even if we you know if i i see dylan every day and dylan you know he 's always happy you know not always sometimes but when when he 's not acting himself i 'm like hey dylan what 's up and in that same way that inconsistency is triggered for me that something 's wrong something 's not right and so you know i might inquire about that but in in business terms in brand terms that inconsistency can be can mean a lost customer it can mean lost revenue and that 's exactly what we want to try and avoid so establishing these key messages and having some consistency within that is really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our customer all right so just to illustrate what key messages are because it 's a very vague concept i 've pulled a couple of posts from city of perth 's instagram feed yeah and all of these posts even though they 're about different things they 're giving across the same key messages for the city of perth so can anyone tell me what a key message uh being delivered by these posts is what 's happening in the city yeah there 's lots happening in the city even though you don 't get that from one post once you look at all of them you see okay city of perth 's got a ton going on or you might see hey city of perth 's got like some great performers great artists great culture or you might think hey city of perth supports its indigenous community these are all key messages that the city of perth is trying to communicate to you and by kind of feeding them through all these different posts they kind of get them across consistently and they weasel their way into your head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it 's not it 's it 's not very just spelt out that way it 's quite subliminal and that 's why we plan out our key messages through our own brainstorming so once you come up with a list of key messages you 're going to be able to input them into all of your social media and it 's really going to drive that home for you for your audience so within this the social media strategy they 've kind of designed some of the photos that they 've had to make it look like there 's a lot going on in city perth and really to their audience what they 're trying to say is come down to city perth come down check out our events you know come into the city yeah so and that 's their goal that 's their objective and that 's their key message right see how they start to add up there are different varieties of key messages these are three broad sort of looks at what your key messages could look like the first two are more common ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more basic but we start off with the first one key selling point so key selling points have a bit more of a logic a logical point they 're our technical features the tech specs right so like i know if i need to buy a laptop i know i need certain features and when i go on google i go and hunt for those exact features right so i type in i need this i need this i need this and i look for those keywords that are there and i know that maybe hi ram to me in translates as a faster computer it means i can run my adobe photoshop because that 's the problem i 've got you know it 's very different to to someone else so i know that i need that and those are the keywords that i 'm trying to solve now for a logic driven buyer that 's going to be perfect because selling points are really really good and you might want to list the key selling points of your services or your um your products whereas a unique value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right so it 's and you need both because they 're different shoppers they 're different types of buyers and we want to have and be targeting both the logical side of the brain and the emotional side as well so unique value proposition is actually something that uh it it 's the real value that that that particular product or service actually has for the lifestyle of that customer so for example if something is affordable that might be the key selling point it 's really affordable but what that means in a as a unique value proposition if that 's the technical spec or the feature is it means that you can take more trips with your family it means you can spend more money doing the things you love so that 's actually the real value that it actually provides the individual right if something is faster for us or more efficient it 's going to save us time therefore we can spend time doing the things we love to do so the way we might gear our communication might be around the emotional side it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is i think a lot of people that are writing communications and writing social media posts and even advertising as well quite often miss that mark you know marketing from 30 40 years ago more tech spec based you know it 's it 's kind of you know if if you 're thirsty drink this whereas i think these days we a lot of marketers are starting to really clue up to well how can i actually interact with our customer and really trigger that side to kind of say okay well what is this value actually providing them on in real terms the other thing with unique value propositions it actually is something that separates you from your competitor right so something is a point of difference and that 's also something that 's very very good to brainstorm as well so when you are in your brainstorming session for your social media strategy which hopefully you guys will be able to do after this sort of session you 'll be up you 'll be able to kind of um work out what your key selling points are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your particular product or service that people might look look for what sets you apart from your customers why would they choose you versus someone else and ultimately what real value are you providing them in real terms into their lifestyle the last one is more brand beliefs and updates so these are things like your values and your vision statements your uh your mission statement as well you know we believe in this we want to see a world that you know is is in this way or you know we believe in an um environmentally friendly business and and we believe in recycling etc these are really really good things by the way because they resonate with your your target market um there 's something that we can sort of say uh that will target specific people that believe in the same thing as we do so it humanizes your brand also you know it is that general company update as well you know merry christmas we 're gonna be closed for christmas hope you have a safe easter drive safe whatever hope you 're you know um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these sorts of things and they still achieve a goal by saying this but they 're more specific communications the key message is we 're human we 're like you we value these things so now that we 've defined more broadly kind of what messages we 're trying to say in our social media strategy so that we can then start creating communications in our posts we want to really get into who we 're speaking to right it 's kind of no secret like this is why i asked the question of you know who is a business owner and who 's managing social media marketing because i do want to get an understanding and a read of the room of who i 'm speaking to so i can tailor this information towards you because everyone 's different everyone has different priorities and everyone came in this morning with different problems that they needed solved however they 're mostly around social media so it 's not just important to just say what you want to say you know if you 're a middle-aged white guy but your product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teenagers have the way you speak might not really resonate with your target market right and i i i 'm sure we 've all seen this where we 're like that was written by you know someone that doesn 't understand that particular problem or that particular product and that 's a massive detriment to to the revenue the sales ultimately the growth of that brand as well because it just disconnects from that target audience you might have the right key messages you might be in the right places but because the the way it 's written just doesn 't really resonate with that target market at all you 've lost them and that 's why it 's a really good idea to make sure that you 're that you 've really honed into who your target audience is so that you can craft communications around that so we need to understand the problem the problems that our target audience have right our potential customer we need to understand what they might like about our brand our company what they even might dislike about our company as well it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaknesses are we need to understand what their priorities are what their maybe their lifestyle are where do they live in a geographical region what their age is what social media they 're on as well right but what are the barriers as well for them to do business with us too what 's stopping them is it geo location are they too far away for us or maybe they just haven 't heard about us we do want to cover things like age as well in terms of getting your typical demographic stuff so age maybe an average age but also an age range as well so target audience isn 't about who um because we obviously want to try and sell as much of our product or service to as many people as possible but this is about niching something so who is more likely to engage with your product it 's not about everybody and that 's why it 's just it 's not ideal it 's not as ideal to have this shotgun approach where we 're just like cool i 'm just going to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible so i can appeal to everybody rather it might be better to tailor your communications so that it 's really really niching into that particular target market to resonate with them so we discover age age range and average age we want gender split as well is it mostly female male you choose your percentages as well just brainstorm this doesn 't have to be exact science if you can do market research that 's awesome but most business owners usually have to go through trial and error phase particularly in the first couple of years but they can understand then we can look at income average income someone that is a low income earner versus a high income owner probably uh you know have different problems that need to be solved and will be spoken to maybe resonate or respond better to different types of language right same with geolocation the way you might speak to an inner city you know living person versus a someone who lives in the country might be wildly different same with outer suburbs as well right and they will have different problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what are the lifestyle married kids you know are they educated are they professionals so these are all good ideas to get into so that we can better tailor our posts to resonate with them at the end of the day we just need to understand um these people better so that we can ideally sell more to them right and here 's how we understand those people better with these personas which we 're going to make a few of uh and these are fictional characters we kind of create to represent broad sections of our target audience so coming up with these fake people helps us understand what what problems we 're trying to solve for our target audience uh what frustrations or barriers they may have to doing business with us what their priorities and motivations are and ultimately when we 're writing our posts online we want to write as if it was to these fictional people and that way your post is gonna it 's gonna resonate with the people your personas represent it 's really important once we 've kind of if we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot they exist and they stay within your business and you might create more of them each individual persona has a different problem that you 're trying to solve they have a different demographic they have a different lifestyle as well and when we 're crafting our communications we 're solving a problem for jill so we 're going to speak to jill so i want to write my communication exactly for jill we 're going to get to know jill and jill 's going to become part of our business right in this in this instance it 's still but it might be jeff as well jeff is also another persona that we use so when we once you 've actually really drilled into these personas and you 'll start to expand on them as well you might just come up with some basics to start off with this is quite a um an in-depth persona but you don 't have to it doesn 't have to be this this in-depth even if you just write a couple things down that way when you 're crafting your posts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you let 's do an example actually so uh ryan distillery man uh do you have kind of uh someone you think buys a lot of your product like a certain type of person yeah sort of middle-aged male yeah maybe medium income medium to high income he 's been drinking a while the emu exports aren 't quite getting him where he needs to be anymore so he 's switching over to whiskey we might write all that down and then when we 're talking on social media what we might be pushing oh this stuff gets you really drunk although i 'm not sure you 're allowed to do that that 's but that 's an example of how you might gear your posts towards your audience personas you can go as broad or specific as you want with this so you can have individual personas for individual product skus if you wanted to go that far and i 'm sure coca-cola do that you know they have that i can 't remember what it 's called they had that that um green labeled life coke that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were doing their market research and product testing for that they would have had individual personas for that right yoga mum maybe it 's for her i don 't know i have no idea but but that could have been a persona that they could have had right so you can go individually on products or services or you can just go more broadly and say you know here 's four to five of the most usual uh most common sort of persona that we would cover and encounter so you don 't have to just create endless personas um i would say exactly three four or five is like right where you want to be that 's what we do our strategies yeah that 's that 's what we do for our social media strategies for our customers as well rather than um but yeah someone like coca-cola they would have a lot more than that um sorry i saw you raised your hand did you have a question as well i think it 's more just like about target audiences yeah our venue is very we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people we 're also in an older area so we have a lot of older patrons but they 're also next to a university yeah so i think it 's being able to put posts up that aren 't uh isolating any of those yeah they 're three very different so again same with personas what you can do with target audience is have a few you can have middle-aged professionals on their way to the office uh you can have old people just out for a stroll uh i 'm sorry the last one was uni students was it yeah you could have uni students coming home from uni stopping by for sorry it was a venue yeah so you could come up with a few and for each one you could list the age the gender the interests the income this kind of thing and then build a persona for each you might for target audience you might have like a primary audience which is the people that are most likely to spend the most amount of money with you right and i don 't know for sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be spending the most amount of money with you compared to maybe some of the others but then again i 'm not sure so you might have a primary audience and then you have some secondary audiences as well right so and you can sort of target those but you don 't want to get every communication every post to just suit everybody have individual posts that are going to target individual personas or individual target target markets right yeah target audiences yeah exactly so you could have one post that 's hey we 've got a seniors discount another post that 's like hey get your your post uni drinks on stuff like this another key part of your social media strategy is what platforms you 're actually going to use what apps it 's an important decision because not all of these apps are born equal certain platforms and when i say platforms i 'm talking about like facebook instagram snapchat certain ones are going to better suit your target audience and your business 's goals so i 'm going to talk about a few of the different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just going to talk about how many you should have and for most businesses just starting out on social media would recommend one just because it 's going to give you some peace of mind it 's going to be a lot easier to get your head around and then once you 've kind of nailed down your social strategy for one platform and it 's moving really smoothly then you can look at adding another i understand what if you what if you decided that having a facebook page and a website were beneficial to starting off yes your website isn 't really it 's so for us um we don 't count that as a social media websites website is more of a portal that connects people to your product and service it provides them with the information that they need and then that that way it basically so if facebook kind of so we don 't cover this here but in in broad marketing spaces there 's a thing called a sales funnel people come in at the top of the funnel where they 're pre-awareness they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right and so facebook and social media is really really good to actually start to have that conversation with people like yeah i 've got that problem too yeah that 's right and because i 've read something they connect with it and it might be something content that you share you know yeah i do have that problem so then i start to have that conversation they see some of the other comments there and they 're like oh those people got the same problem and they 've solved it using this service or this provider um what that then does is they 're sort of at that that awareness phase that they 've got a problem then they 're going to start researching okay what are my options here and how to solve that problem that 's when they go to your website your website 's further down that chain of that sales process that buyer 's journey it 's called a buyer 's journey um so so website 's a little bit different we don 't we don 't really class that as a social media so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm fully aware of what your business is but you know i would recommend that and then having facebook there is a way to access new people you know connect with those audiences increase your legitimacy and trust and then hopefully funnel them to your website which is then going to continue that conversation through the com through that um comparison stage of the buyer 's journey and they 're like yeah cool i 'm sold and then they send their details to you or they make a purchase on your website right if you did want to have multiple social media accounts there 's no problem with having a few as long as you 're doing them well it 's just it 's all about remembering that it 's better to do one of these channels well then a few poorly uh that 's that 's the main the main point there so let 's talk a bit about facebook who here has a facebook account facebook is a really broad platform almost everyone has an account but the people who use it who engage with it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facebook is really great for service based businesses like hannah with the cafe because you can deliver updates very easily we 're closed this weekend we 've got a new product say hi to our new staff member right so facebook is very good for those service oriented businesses instagram hits that bit of a younger audience millennials 18 to kind of middle age and this one 's great for product based businesses because it 's a very visual platform uh so if you have a lot of products that are very nice to look at like clothes or beauty products those are going to do really well on instagram linkedin um most of you would have a linkedin yeah yep uh kind of again middle-aged but more of a professional focus than a personal focus so it does really well with business to business companies uh like say corporate like recruitment or hr tech like an engineering firm maybe an accounting firm stuff like this uh is really great to have a linkedin profile for your business and then there 's a ton more which i 'm not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the crop really there 's hundreds of platforms the important thing is just to choose the platform that suits your target audience and suits your business so look we 've we 've covered really the broad part of the social media strategy um and again just to kind of summarize what they were you know we wanted to brainstorm what our business objectives are which probably were your business goals which you probably already have and then you know turning them into um social media objectives you know how we might actually be able to um translate that into how we interact with our social media we 're going to define what our key messages are more broadly um you know what maybe are our values and and our vision and mission statements um you know what do we stand for what are our key selling points how do we turn those key selling points in from a logic you know a logical kind of feature into more of a an emotional grab for that user as well we 've looked at target audiences and personas and brainstorming those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to then of course we 've just had a look at um you know the individual social media channels and and kind of who they 're more targeted at um but of course when you go through your target audience and your personas you probably start to really hone into where they might be because you know ultimately you know those people that you for example say then you 're selling hearing aids you know maybe maybe they 're reading the newspaper maybe you target all instructors reading the newspaper maybe they 're not on social media right you know there 's no point going on to tick tock kind of smashing out some hearing aid sort of content for millennials and younger so although that could be hilarious but um it might not be quite quite so useful for you and a useful use of the time does anyone know what i 'm talking about when i say content creation and content curation these are the two types of content you can post to social media creation is content you 've created yourself like you say if you take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely event we 're at and post it to your socials that would be content creation and on the other hand content curation is content that you 've taken and repurposed from another business or another organization and posted to your socials because you know it 's going to be relevant to the kind of audience that you have on social media and so you can use both of these types uh to grow your social media and you 're going to want to find a balance between how much you create and how much you curate if you spend all your time creating content you 're not gonna have time to run your business right but if you spend if you only do content curation people are gonna be following you and they 're like who are you like why who are you can i hear something about your actual brand i want to know about you that 's why i followed you i don 't want to hear about all these other organizations so it 's important to strike the right balance of creation verse curation for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a post we created for our facebook uh for international women 's day charlie came up with this amazing design uh yes this is beyonce for international women 's day and this is an example of a post we 've curated this is a blog from campaign brief and a marketing organization and we shared it to our audience because we know marketing is something they 're interested in so this article might be something they 're interested in but you know well even if our customers were following us on linkedin and they saw this and they 're not they don 't really care about the wamo what it actually does show for us is it says ah they 've got their finger on the pulse of the local marketing association right so that 's actually what 's demonstrating to our customer says oh yeah well they know what they 're talking about they 're actually across this sort of stuff they may not read the blog they may not even care about it but at least they 've read that top part and they said okay cool well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get across right yeah uh and it 's important to know that this is not stealing because what we 're doing is helping whoever we 're curating content from so in this case campaign brief when someone clicks on this link they go to the campaign brief website so we 're not just building relationships with our customers we 're building relationships with industry partners other businesses like you said this is a great way to build that community around yourself and really be a part of your industry and these are content pillars which i 'm going to go through individually these are kind of shortcuts you can use to make sure your content is valuable to the people uh consuming it so each of your posts should be geared towards one or more of these content pillars and that 's going to really make sure people are going to engage with that post so the first one is to connect here 's another example from our instagram of a post we 're just using to connect with our audience who likes pulp fiction come on come on come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're just kind of relating to them about a common problem creatives have a lot of our audience on instagram is actually other social media marketers and graphic designers yeah and all sorts of creatives yeah uh so this first we 're trying to connect with them to this with this post other ways you can connect with your audience through social media posts or maybe if you took them behind the scenes like ryan if you showed off your distillery machines um that would be a great way to connect with them or just kind of start a conversation with your audience like we 're trying to do here about fair pay for creatives then there 's entertain this is just simply trying to entertain your audience trying to be funny or engaging or just enjoyable so here 's a post we made for christmas again great design charlie so ways you could do this is you could gather user generated content uh for example photos of someone using your product may entertain your audience or just joining in whatever the current conversation is whether it 's christmas or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's inform which is content that educates someone or teaches them about your industry maybe giving them some inside tips and tricks this is an example of one we made for social media marketers uh helping them figure out their social media strategy like we 're doing for you guys and then finally there 's promote which is just content that 's trying to sell your products or service getting the word out there and this isn 't really selling in the way that a tv ad is because people come to your profile to see this they want to know what you 've got going on what you 're selling what you 're proud of so this is just putting them in front of putting that in front of them giving them what they came to see right so ways you could promote your product on social media you could share a testimonial or a view from one of your customers or you could highlight one of your like special products or services maybe talk about a sale you 've got going on these are always you can promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the different like ways you can post the only thing you need to keep in mind here is to use the right form of content for what you 're posting so if you 're posting a picture of your product you 're obviously going to want to post a picture if you 're posting a blog article you have on your website then you 're obviously going to post a link right then really we want to get into content curation content curation is not to be glossed over either so ideally we want to be creating as much original content as we can but we 're all pretty time poor and we 've got a lot of things to do so i know that when we first started out we were just curating you know most of our stuff it was just it was quite difficult for us to find the time to create as long while also starting the company and while you know servicing our clients and and doing everything else that all the many hats that we all wear as business owners and social uh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one part of that so content curation really does become a bit of a saving grace because this content is already created that someone else has created for us that it 's kind of relevant to us it might help support to sort of support our brand by sending the same sort of key message as well so content curation is content that we kind of appropriate from other from other brands they could be any of these really so an industry partner you know might be someone that say for example you 're a pool technician you you install pool heaters a pool the manufacturer of that pool heater might be an industry partner obviously you you engage with their product and use their product so for example you know the hampton hotel it might be um one of the alcohol suppliers or not suppliers but the brands the alcohol brands you know it might be a promotion that they 're running sort of thing um there 's some content there it might be an industry organization so for example um you know in this in in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of perth put out an advisory on pool fences seems pretty you know applicable for that kind of area that this particular you know service provider is is is working in so they might then share that content to their facebook or their linkedin or whatever related industry organization might be someone like using the same example it might be say the cancer foundation because they have a slip slop slap campaign that 's running usually it 's probably targeted at people that are going to the beaches but you know what it 's still relevant because people are going to be in the sun for the pool as well so you know it 's it 's something that we can appropriate for for that particular service provider so you start to see quite quickly how you can gather a heap of content but i think when people go wrong they don 't really know where to get this content from so it 's actually just good to spend about 30 to 60 minutes brainstorming different organizations both your industry partners other industry organizations some related industry organism organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one there is something like city of perth let 's say for example you know your service is in the city of perth now you might post something that says oh you know city perth have got this amazing event on or something like that now it has nothing to do with your brand or your service your product but basically does send that key message that we look after our community we 're involved in our community we want you to come and join our community and enjoy our community as well so it 's still sending a nice good feel-good message even though it might not relate to to your brand or service specifically so that 's where your complimentary organizations kind of come in as well so ultimately and i alluded to this before if you can 't create curate so you know usually you 'd prefer a split you know roughly about 80 20 80 of it 's going to be curated or maybe 70 curated and 30 is your own created content but when we 're creating content we do you know we obviously prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and really nice imagery what have you if you can 't get that that 's okay still as well but you know we 've got the curation there to kind of fall back on right spend some time brainstorming this sort of stuff because this is what 's going to save you time if you 've got a really really busy week or a couple of weeks or a busy month this is the thing that 's going to get you out of hot water right unless you 're posting something and you 're consistent and it 's still sending some good key messages to your audience so that 's probably the the best advice i can give you out of this whole thing to be honest that and target audience probably my two favorite things but yeah definitely um be aware of this and so just to summarize you know we 've covered um you know things like the different content pillars we 've covered content curation content creation we 've covered um content types as well you know link you know image video etc with our last couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what are they and how you can use them right so a content calendar is this it 's basically like a spreadsheet in excel or google sheets or in your lap that you can use to plan out your content in advance and what this is going to do is let you be really strategic with where you 're placing your content you can have a mix of different content types you can have some connecting content you can have some informing content and it 's also going to save you time instead of you know spending an hour every couple days coming up with a social media post you might just spend a couple hours on a monday planning all your posts for the month and scheduling them in facebook or instagram and then forgetting about it until the start of the next month right and so that 's going to give you a lot of peace of mind having everything planned out in advance done dusted don 't have to worry about it there are scheduling tools as well that you can just plug your posts into really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this content calendar does is it kind of gives you everything for that post itself and that 's what this this entire sort of workshop has been about as well as gathering that content to some of the stakeholders that are in the room um which i 'm sure you 're already doing but almost every person who 's here you 're cutting if you can take a photo and that you just build a bank of images that you can save and schedule into this type of calendar yeah legoland press you know people want to see your food and you guys have a really gnarly scrolling sitting on top of your counter as well people want to see that stuff so you can capture all of that content and save it in the bank and you can put it into these yeah so this is how you use this schedule it 's super simple you start let 's say what 's the day today is the ninth yep so let 's say we make a post for the 10th we 're going to click here super hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the image let 's say we 're posting a photo it could be a video as well or there could be no photo choose an image to upload desktop nope that 's documents yeah so that 's just one of our little neon dudes uh and then what social platforms are we gonna put it on let 's say linkedin right up the top here in this bar linkedin and maybe facebook as well because why not and then we come to this little drop down menu here this arrow we click and we can see all the different content pillars and we can say okay this this this post is going to promote my coffee it 's going to show off my coffee so i 'm going to click promote and then i go and i hover on the picture and it gives you this prompt where you can plan and ahead your caption great bloody coffee um your hashtags i roll josh the content business owner i know sometimes it 's hard to explain to them what 's coming up or what you 're doing whereas if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the business owner and say this is what this is what i 'm delivering and you can have a chat about it or you miss this hashtag or you should be linking this person in or actually don 't like that picture we need a different picture and vice versa if you 're a business owner and you 've got someone managing your social media instead of seeing it when it goes live or two minutes before it goes live pretty happy with this if you can set this up it 's something that you can work on and make changes to and make sure that you 're really happy with what is going out because as we said before it only takes one or two quotes and inconsistent would don 't feel quite right pictures not the best picture or something you know and it 's gone and it 's out and it 's too late whereas this gives you the chance to review it beforehand yeah gives you that approval process i guess and also you 'll evolve this as well over time like you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ton of tips and tricks i mean jackie i know you were talking about you know taking photos of customers hairs as well great one really really easy one that i i love is just actually having a template there could be in canberra or something like that that 's nice well designed and taking people 's quotes their reviews even if it is on google you know even the things that they say to you and you just put can i put your name down there just your first notice one and then so you ask them that and then you just put that in a nice quote thing and that 's someone 's review so that what that does for us you know like i go to google reviews before i go to a restaurant now i don 't know any of those people that left the review i don 't know none of them but i know that there 's enough of them and i 'm like well if they all liked it i 'm probably gonna like it too um and it 's a bit like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like yeah yeah you should buy nike airs because i 'm wearing them right it 's like endorsement so that 's just one of the easy things there 's like if you 've got a few of those banked up like reviews and like you know and you just keep whenever there 's an opportunity to capture content like taking photos of food or customer 's hairs or before and afters or what have you um just take it and bank it and then think of something later on you know how you can sort of turn it into a promotion or turn it into an inform then you then you plug it into this process and you 'll be able to get some decent content out of it can i say something else that you guys talked about knowing your customer to expedite this kind of calendar process as well for each of those customers if you can build a bank of kind of hashtags that speak to that particular customer then it just becomes a copy and paste into this type of spreadsheet you 're not there spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already thought about it you 've already crafted that message to that particular stakeholder i mean there 's not quite enough thing as too much posting if it 's all if it 's all good content i think huffington post posts a blog every one minute so there 's really not obviously you 're not going to put out that amount of content the important thing rather than putting out a lot is to put it out consistently if you 've only got time to do two posts a week that 's fine just make sure they always go out wednesday 9 a.m friday 6pm right um people are generally drinking maybe wednesday um [Music] speaking to your audiences based on their schedules as well yeah yeah do you know what i mean the days of posting lots of content are gone you know it 's all about quality content rather than just quantity okay so make something is relevant don 't just spam post everything that 's not what we want which is good because we don 't we want to save time anyway that 's going to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts a week right good posts a week rather than 10 not so good posts yeah right it 's just yeah yeah and yeah always so for example you know if you 're you 're an eatery and you 've got this lunch special on would you post that at 4 p.m probably not you 've probably posted in the morning yeah you know when people start to think about lunch as well so as you build these calendars you 'll start to see when your audience is online because you 'll start tracking your metrics too right and where your engagement is and it 's going to be a bit of a trial on everything you know you might you might end up posting something you 're like why i didn 't really it didn 't really get as much engagement when i posted it on friday night like to be honest we wouldn 't post anything on a friday night like it 's just everyone 's out and everyone 's finished their week they don 't normally interest they 're doing stuff um you know but that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair i would think most businesses would have that problem anyway um because they 're already busy doing something and so rather than doing it on friday night have to be friday pretty early in the morning if you wanted any engagement right um and even for yourself as well they 're probably already making those plans yeah you know friday night they 're out they 're doing stuff yeah same in the weekend scrolling through facebook yeah precisely yeah uh and so the thing about being consistent like that is not only will your your audience love it knowing that they can come on facebook every tuesday and see your deal of the week uh but facebook loves it as well the the actual code loves seeing people post consistently whether it 's every day or every tuesday or every second day they know this is an account that 's not just throwing stuff at the wall they know this is an account that 's taking itself seriously and so they promote your account right and so once you 've figured out all your content pillars and you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these you schedule everything at the start of the month and you forget about it right that 's the dream to not worry about social media at all at least that 's my dream as a social media marketer to add to what dylan was just saying he was talking about this elusive thing called the algorithm um and you know facebook twitter all social media accounts they they use an algorithm to push certain content in people 's feeds and basically the more popular the content the more people are then going to get shown it because that 's what they want they want people to create content and you 're the product when it 's social media right so you 're creating the content that other people digest and they 're like well if it 's good content we 're gonna promote that more and so that 's how you can kind of hack the algorithm that 's why i said to ryan that it 's uh it 's more about quality rather than quantity because if you 're just posting stuff out there the algorithm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won 't promote your content as much even in future posts that would be very engaging it 's harder to it 's like digging a hole and it 's harder to get out of that right so it 's good to start with a a healthy healthy level yeah so just yeah quality versus quantity and that 's what really sets the sets you guys apart when it comes to the algorithms then go to the next platform this is going to be the content as we 've said has to be slightly different you can 't just keep posting the same thing on different platforms it could be the same message but it might have a different picture or a different time or the message might be meant to be tweaked so we started with facebook yeah and then we moved over to instagram we 're going be doing instagram for last six months we 've only been doing organic stuff as well um and we 've been posting maybe once a week sort of thing maybe well as always as far as the algorithm goes there 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graphic design is really important for us and they 're two different um they 're two different sort of formats as well so we while we do post individually they 're actually different photos different images um and then and we don 't use the same hashtags as well so that 's us you know we 've we 've got a social media unicorn a lot of yeah exactly there 's fantastic and you want to show it do it sorry like like my i guess my question is like is that detrimental to you not at all not at all you 've just got to keep in mind what your audience for the different platforms are so if you 've got twitter to reach i don 't know tick you 've got tick tock to reach the teenagers but you 're also selling to middle-aged men on facebook if you take a photo and you think this is going to work for both audiences absolutely post to both channels because saves you a lot of work right but if it 's not a photo that 's gonna if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that facebook audience you don 't wanna post it there because it 's gonna lower the trust in your brand right so there 's no problem with posting to like three or four different platforms with the same photo as long as it 's geared towards those audiences those goals of yours right for example that 's a great point i posted something yesterday on my personal facebook that was just funny yeah but then i posted the same thing on my professional linkedin account just by posting them professional one went into more detail and kind of talked about you know those things and and what have you because different audiences right like professional leaders versus just friends and family and you know in the same way our facebook is you know kind of does take a lot of different content um but instagram for example is more about visual stuff whereas linkedin is is our professional stuff usually facebook gets both of those right but what happens on instagram doesn 't really happen on linkedin for our professional concept online it 's humanized instagram is very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's that direct connection um and that 's why sometimes even those professional highly done photos aren 't so great because it does kind of create a bit of a barrier and you 'll see a lot of big brands that are using user generated content and they have that user-generated content as a way of kind of building that connection to connect um with their audience say you know we 're just like you you know just regular people stuff you don 't always need to have these professional photos either you don 't need to have professionally designed um you know posts as well it 's ideal when you 're creating a brand and creating that brand ecosystem but you don 't have to because there are advantages and that 's where instagram is really good it does give you that behind the scenes sort of thing right so um so today we 've covered uh you know why social media strategy is important we 've got the basics of that how it can save you some time create a bit more efficiency in your and your social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their typical uses we 've covered the difference between content curation content creation hopefully give you a couple of nuggets of wisdom there and the social media types ultimately we 're bringing it all together so that you can effectively plan out your social media schedule get more out of social media hopefully drive you know um more business into into your doors and and um you know get youtube business goals a little bit quicker um if you 'd like to follow us we 're at get turned online for facebook and instagram linkedin is just concept on concepts on dot com"

development team and i guess one of the things we wonder as we look to make our city shine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best time of the year in the city the weather is great families are out enjoying the city the weather is terrific although it 's going to be very hot for christmas week and also there are great attractions in our city but you do wonder here is lord mayor and i 'm sure as councillors is

of those great things happen thank you to our staff thank you to our councillors and thank you to our visitors for celebrating christmas and seeing the city shine in 2021 so with all of that i moved to yes that 's right here it is uh 5.1 uh public questions no public questions have been received in advance for this many are there any questions from the floor so item 5.2 is deputation ceo are there any deputations yes lord mayor we have received two deputations in relation to item 14.3 okay thank you ceo please be reminded there is a 10 minute limit for deputations i 'm now going to invite leslie warren representing the east perth community group to please step forward to make your deputation leslie welcome back congratulations on a terrific expert community group event a couple of weeks ago um brass on the grass well attended by us we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in shorts that was a highlight for me um leslie if you could your name and address my name is leslie warren i live in bronte street in east perth and apologies i too i 'm in shorts but my car 's broken down in mandarin i just hopped off the train so limited resources for this meeting so lord mayor deputy lord mayor councillors ladies and gentlemen my name is leslie warren of the east perth community group and i 'm speaking today for myself and on behalf of the east perth community group committee thank you for the opportunity to make representation to the council with respect to the council exploring options for a community group insurance support program to cover the costs of insurance for community groups in the city of perth i 'm speaking as one of the community groups potentially affected by this proposal insurance is a vital part of our viability and business operations and we welcome the city exploring options that will assist us in neighborhood place making and supporting our community and livability in the city our vice chair and chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make this session i 'm continuing their submission as advised at the agenda briefing session the east perth community group currently has close to 900 members we have an active committee of eight and several working groups with approximately 40 regular and active volunteers our shindigs and community meetings also regularly attract 100 or more members and you 've referenced brass on the grass which is an annual event which this year we we put on over the last several years east perth community group has applied for sponsorship from the city of perth for a variety of events and activations the cost of ongoing administrative expenses such as insurance is specifically precluded currently under the city 's policy on sponsorship insurance has repeatedly been mentioned as an issue for us either in relation to insurance costs or the relevance of the coverage to the activities of the group brass on the grass was a case in point insurance only covers events up to 500 people we needed to engage an events company in order to ensure we had sufficient coverage in some cases we doubt if we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ install parklets there are concerns regarding insurance cover for the installed infrastructure the more we look into this issue when considering activities in the community the greater the concern we have affordability of insurance is a critical issue to us as we need it to provide financial protection and peace of mind for members volunteers and participants the eastport community group shares the same broad concerns with insurance as other neighborhood groups such as west perth local northbridge common and city of perth western residents and we 've spoken with representatives of these groups and are in a sim of a similar mind with regard to the proposed limits the groups potentially impacted and the policy changes required to make this work to begin with a 2000 limit would not be enough for us our current insurance is 2776.22 and is cheaper than the 3540 we were initially quoted by another company however it does not include workers compensation which we 've recently identified as a potential shortcoming we 're also mindful insurance premiums are likely to increase and therefore the costs are only likely to increase a two thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your initial estimates of twenty thousand share between ten groups and breakdown of costs comes in at one thousand eight hundred and thirty per group excluding gst and 2013 including gst as a non-gst registered organisation we are required to also find the gst component this would leave a gap between the amount we currently pay and the proposed grant amount which is likely to be even greater when workers compensation and increase in premium amounts over time are included we have not been able to find adequate insurance cover for costs as low as those that were quoted in the exploratory paper i understand there was some discussion at the agenda briefing session regarding the groups covered whilst comfortable at the notion new entities could be included once they are established we would probably be happy to see this crowd restricted to entities that have been active in the city are involved in neighbourhood place making such as those in that attend the neighborhood meetings neighborhood place plans and those that deliver to communities potentially using city of perth grant funding we do support the need for there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need for the groups to be incorporated finally we have a question around timing current grant guidelines do not allow for reimbursement for previous expenses we would welcome some clarity around this in the guidelines especially as insurance renewal periods may not align with grant timelines protect to protect the public purse we would also think that a requirement for two quotes would possibly be prudent in closing we want to be clear we 're very appreciative of the consideration the council is giving to the funding of assurances for community groups and request that further consideration be given to the current and projected costs we occur incur to obtain adequate coverage thank you and as this is the last council meeting and the last opportunity merry christmas and thank you for your support over the years it 's been appreciated thank you leslie and to you too and to all of the east perth community group team and members i 'll just ask you to stay there if you don 't mind uh if any councillors have questions in relation to this deputation now is the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relation to the item i just ask you to hold those until this item is tabled for questions so does anybody have any questions for leslie deputy lord mayor thank you very much leslie for your deportation um i know i 'm aware that you 're not the treasurer of i am the treasurer you are okay how much have you spent on insurance in the last 12 months uh that was well the amount for for the last insurance premium that we paid that was including all your events insurance well the event insurance for the brass on the grass because it was over 500 we had an events management company so their insurance covered that so our insurance for the last for the 12 months was 2776 and 22 cents and did that cover all your events it covered events up to 500. people but we didn 't have any other events other over that amount so the kind of insurance that you took out was um insurance beyond just business as usual insurance for a community group it was not just your public liability and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute i just ah sorry i 've gone and moved the file and now i can 't find it it will be here that 's okay i think you 've given us a ballpark perhaps i can ask you if you had more opportunities to apply for insurance coverage would you have bigger events beyond 500 people would you apply for bigger events look the way the city of perth now has the grants program structured makes it a bit difficult to answer because the grants that you give to some extent are predicated on the amount of patronage you 're expecting so because events up to 500 would normally only attract a small ground amount that would potentially limit what we would aim for it 's been a learning curve this year with insurance well and last year as well with the previous chairperson with michelle mccloskey we really started looking closely at insurance what we were actually covered for whether we were getting value for money and that 's why we sought a different insurer this year because the 3500 that we were quoted didn 't actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does so we 've got public liability office bearers association liability and voluntary workers this is the three components of what we actually have at the moment okay thank you leslie does the expert community group charge a membership currently we don 't charge a membership it 's one of the very many issues that i have been exploring in the last year in terms of how we 're actually going to fund ourselves ongoing we certainly flagged it at our last agm it 's in on the public record i tabled a record of the annual expenses for the last eight years nine years 2013 um and that information is in the public domain and included in it you know the fact that what insurances were the um the question to membership fees did generate a little bit of debate because of the size of our membership which is 900 people at the moment the treasurer does the job with a spreadsheet and my brain and until we actually have a process in place to accept fees and the like it 's you can 't just launch out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admin behind it and yeah so there 's some limitations there we need to look a lot more closely at what i likely take would be and then what we would do with it in terms of provide you know some admin support around that yeah okay so it 's it 's a vexing issue no no i understand um so because i think what the city is proposing and then we 'll see this a little bit later on and there 's a sort of a first year trial amount of two thousand dollars but we would agree that that would go some way or a lot of the way towards covering your insurance costs it would go two thousand dollars towards of the way which this year was two thousand seven hundred so you 'd be seven hundred next year would probably be more but yeah yeah okay all right yeah sure let 's see just a follow-up to the lord mayor 's inquiry um what other what are your other revenue sources at the moment we get some small amounts of grants and sponsorships but i would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a healthy surplus and over the last eight years or so it 's been just you know gradually whittled away so we 've got containers for change we get some grants and don 't like donations um very occasionally there 's a little bit of money that 's you know left over after a particular activity or we 've raised money at raffles and the like so okay so in terms of your events that you put on for the community are they largely sponsored by the city of perth some of the response largely sponsored by the city of perth and we 've also got some other sponsorships from some of the other businesses yeah in ace path in experts thank you are there any other questions from any of our councillors okay we 'll get the opportunity to discuss this a little bit later on leslie thank you and a merry christmas to you too and uh best wishes to all of the eastworth community group members thanks for being here tonight thank you uh thank you so we 'll go now to steve willard another familiar face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to come forward uh again ten minute reminder if you could say your name your address and away you go thank you very much my name 's stephen wellard of 1303 hay street uh west perth i 'm here representing west perth local where i hold the title of president we change from chairperson to president wessens so much more interesting um good evening lord mayor deputy lord mayor uh councillors ceo and the senior executive uh today i 'll speak to the current recommendation for item 14.3 community group insurance program as leader of a dynamic community association i don 't normally intend to spend much time talking about insurance have we have many great and exciting initiatives to work on delivering with the city however as a volunteer not-for-profit organization we can only be successful in delivering events and activations if we have adequate insurance in place to protect our volunteers our contractors our visitors and of course the association with that in mind it 's important for us to get this agenda item right for both the active incorporated neighborhood groups and the city who helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our outgoing vice president and subject matter expert rachel thomas outlined the reasons why the proposed uh two thousand dollars per neighborhood group was grossly inadequate we spent this week reviewing our current insurance policy its limitations and shortfalls due to budget and scope constraints and really just west perth local getting up off the ground we had an insurance policy in place for the minimum required to carry out small events up to 500 people very similar to what leslie outlined we don 't have the funds available to upgrade our policy to include things that were listed last week like voluntary work insurance sorry voluntary workers insurance association liability or even workers compensation that was mentioned during the deputations we now understand much better that there are risks that we 're carrying that 's not healthy for us to continue long term we 've been advised that adding in these new elements will almost double our current premium up to about three thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars in twenty twenty two we 've also been advised to expect price increases in twenty twenty three five ten percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding of up to four thousand dollars per neighborhood group per financial year with an additional allowance for inflation and premium increases over subsequent years now we understand this is not a low-cost initiative and therefore to as a proposal to limit the impact to the city 's budget we suggest the number of eligible neighborhood groups be much less than the 10 or 12 mainly inactive groups that were listed during the agenda briefing and utilizing the city 's neighborhood place plans 2122 as a guide we recommended the following active registered incorporated association neighborhood groups be incorporated in the initial funding scope so from the suburb of west perth it 'd be west perth local northbridge would be northbridge common from coralie nedlands would be the city of perth western residents association central perth would be activate perth and historic heart and of course east perth would be the east perth community group so this total six active incorporated neighborhood groups at a cost of up to four thousand dollars per group would make the total 2022 budget 24 000 now additional budget may be required in subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional active neighborhood groups that require dedicated insurance policies to safely carry out the city of perth funded community activations west perth locals see the proposed changes i 've outlined today as a great start in working even more closely in 2022 for the safe benefit of our volunteers ratepayers workers and visitors i 'd like to thank the lord mayor deputy lord mayor councillors and the city administration for the consideration and support of the neighborhood groups throughout the year across the city thank you and merry christmas thank you steve merry christmas to you too and everybody in west perth you all do a terrific job and important members of the city of perth uh community obviously does anybody have any questions for steve thanks dln thanks lord mayor steve thank you very much for that deputation can you tell me what your revenue sources are for west perth local yeah we have um we have uh we say for real revenue source is just definitely funding from the city we have grants that come in from the likes of the rac and we have approached the likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well but we also have a membership which is quite low but it does generate some funds to allow us to do ongoing costs that aren 't covered by young grants even if we talk about the commercial grants that do come in they do have limitations as to what you can spend those on as you know we do have a shop front so we we receive in-kind i suppose rent so we don 't pay for that we do have to pay for electricity and telephone charges and the likes so that 's where our membership and other grants are going to um so that 's basically where our sources are and do you think that um getting the right amount of insurance insurance will help you evolve and elevate your offering for west perth definitely we want to we want to step it up um definitely right now we 're looking at an event for the perth heritage week and as leslie mentioned with the city 's activation grants it 's in different stages and the first stage i think is five thousand dollars for events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars for events up to a thousand so for us to do an event beyond 500 people we need a better insurance policy so this would help us then to step up and do some events that have much more courage much more reach across the residents visitors and workers across west perth thank you very much that 's great thanks dale are there any other can i ask what what your how what 's your membership fees stay 100 for businesses and 10 for individual members okay thank you are there any other questions from anyone steve merry christmas thank you very much thanks for being here we appreciate your deputation and leslie 's also are we going to move then to item number six is no other deputations i see item number six on the agenda is

2022 council meeting schedule 16-1 fraud and corruption plan 16-3 internal audit reports 2020 2021. could i now get a seconder for this motion please thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion being unopposed i will now declare it carried unanimously the recommendations of those items have now been passed on block in accordance with clause 9.2 of the city of perth 's standing orders local law 2009 and the officers recommendations have been adopted by council we 'll move now to item 11 planning and economic developments alliance reports 11-1 is fenced off lead say it again fenced off lead dog park investigation would anybody like to move a motion to deal with this item thank you council governor second please uh thank you councillor fleeton uh councillor gobert thank you lord majesty uh briefly speaking to the recommendation this was an issue that was raised with me some time ago and i 'm glad that it 's coming before council for a decision finally and particularly of interest that the two parks that are nominated the new one uh towards the northeast of the city and an expansion of the existing one i frequently walk past the existing one at the end of langley park at ozone reserve and it 's quite a popular local community amenity so i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in the future thank you thanks thank you councillor robert uh councillor fleeton was the second thanks lord i can ask a question first and i 'm sorry for some of the questions i asked this evening i was sick last week so i didn 't get a chance firstly in the report did the city consider with the expansion of ozone to introduce some fencing to separate small and big dogs as in the consultation ceo could i please ask the general manager planning and economic development to respond thank you and through you lord mayor yes we did explore that possibility particularly given it was something that the community had indicated they would like through the consultation process i 'm advised that the optimum size for a dog park if you 're going to separate the areas into areas for small dogs and large dogs is around 2 000 square meters and that 's to prevent overcrowding and degradation of the space in to quicker time and so at ozone it was decided not to segregate the space because that would mean a much larger expansion than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not appropriate to do that given the use of that reserve for other much larger public events uh thanks gm um that 's my only question i 'll just make some comments happy to support um page 28 of 317 states in its research wellington square is a site of significance and represents an important meeting place for traditional owners during the consultation of the recent upgrade of wellington square the wajak working party requested that the park be left unfenced and welcoming for all users in respect of the site 's cultural heritage council will be sick and tired of me hearing this but i want to see more emphasis on the respect part two when it comes to this park we all know that 's not the case right now there are too many people trashing this park we 're not able to see people using the 18 million dollar playground i think that 's actually a much better site to invest in a off off-league dog park to put some fence around it but will rely on their feedback and i particularly want to concentrate on page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for food vans why would we use ratepayer funds to install infrastructure to give an unfair advantage to businesses not from the city who are not paying the same high level of costs as our own ratepayers do less than two minutes of walking distance from these facilities we 've got a new offer a new coffee place opening at the bottom of view tower on the point is a nice walk and close by plus there 's a japanese takeaway restaurant near the bowling club and a cafe around this the corner i don 't know why the city would suggest that we turn a off-lead dog park into a place where businesses who aren 't even paying rates to us can come and take advantage of it but liam great motion i know this is part of what you 've been pushing and happy to support it thank you councillor clayton does anybody uh wish to speak for the motion uh anyone wish to speak against the motion counselor thank you lord mayor and perhaps just to address councillor fleeton 's comments just now uh the inclusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of community events that might run or might be able to run on the park um jack marks park for example in the city of vincent frequently has um small one-off little events and it 's it 's just a great community building day people with their dogs are always out there so that was really the intent behind that it wasn 't to undermine any local businesses so thanks councillor gobert oh thank you uh so uh without anything further we 'll put this to the vote all those in favor that 's carried unanimously thank you move to item 12 community development alliance reports 12 1 major events and festival sponsorship would anyone like to move a motion to deal with this item i will uh we have a seconder thank you councillor gobert um right so i will open the batting then um well the council 's recommendations are there to support the in principle budget allocation of three million dollars we 've talked about becoming the major events and festivals capital of perth i think we 're some way down the path to being that but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available to us to be able to do this and opportunities will present from time to time some that we 're not necessarily expecting and we know that uh when these amounts were first mooted back in the day the cost of putting on events the competition what you 're trying to do the technology all of those things means a bigger budget is required and i think the bigger budget is significant i note also that the recommendation from admin is that the sponsorship provided by the city of perth not exceed 60 percent of the total event budget i appreciate that this is probably for some a high percentage but i think it just gives us scope that 's what i think it 's there for we don 't know what the event might be we don 't know what the opportunity might present we 're not saying that we 're going to spend 60 of the total budget on every event and in fact in many events we 're not going to spend any of it we 're just going to be the facilitators but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why i support the recommendations from the council second it was councillor gobert anything to add thank you lord mayor yeah i think you 're exactly right the reality is that we 're coming off the back of a time in our city 's history where we need to regain a competitive thought and in attracting large events major events and festivals i think we need to put our money where our mouth is show that we are committed to drawing large events to the city and inherently the people that come with it it 's people that support businesses that support cafes that shop in our local retail outlets and this is just one way albeit a bit passive and a bit short term but it is a way to be competitive in bringing people back into our city so i 'm more than happy to support thanks councillor government does anybody wish to speak against the motion council gordon may i please move an amendment um that point two be amended to replace sixty percent with fifty percent so we 'll need a seconder thanks councillor fleeton council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord man um as previously identified to my fellow councillors my opinion is that the 60 is inconsistent with our position as being a facilitator of events it puts us forward as a majority funder um it puts the figure out into the public arena that we 're willing to fund 60 of the cost of any of or not of any event but of particular events my preference would be to run that in to 50 my understanding and i 'm happy for the administration to respond is that even if we stipulate 50 in the guideline that matters can come before council which would enable any specific event to achieve the 60 but i don 't want to be putting an expectation out in the community of such a high figure so my preference is the 50 thank you thanks council gordon councillor fleeton has anybody wish to speak against the amendment i might just take this opportunity to say that i i don 't believe councillor gordon that it creates the expectation in the community that every event that comes before us for consideration will be funded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why um why you might have that opinion i 'll get that and that 's and that 's reasonable but but i think what this does is it gives us the opportunity to go to those places if we need to i wouldn 't think we 're going to go there for every event but it gives us that scope so for that reason i would oppose the amendment anybody else four cancel those i have a question uh of the ceo really ceo uh so if there was a proposal that was just if we accepted the 50 and it was just just over 50 unless i was 55 what 's the process for it to come through to council so it would need to come through the world where it would need to come through to council so often it is about the administration um being able to have clear parameters and criteria as to what goes towards making these decisions so would be the time that would be taken and possibly opportunities lost can you just elaborate slightly on the time so that component sorry through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the council process it could be as much time as it takes to get a paper prepared and ready through for council so minimum six weeks uh does anybody else wish to speak for or against the amendment yeah councillor ko sorry just a question sure um if we do end up voting to support fifty percent versus sixty percent would that mean we 'll be able to support more events thank you through the lord mayor yes this would mean for next financial year it represents an increase in that overall budget and the discretion that we 're able to i think the question was um i think if i 've understood the question right is if if we approve here 50 rather than 60 you 're saying would we therefore would that therefore translate into more events supported but i don 't think i don 't think that that is right no not necessarily i 'm sorry i 'm quite uncertain about the question let me explain it yes sorry sorry so i think what councillor ko is saying is by reducing the amount of funding possible in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean necessarily that there will be more events put on by the city of perth or funded by the city of perth yeah thank you possibly right and possibly not also it 's hard to know that was like a doctor 's prescription counselor i could read your writing the ceo could not so sorry yeah um thank you uh a question yes the wa day example that we had it was put on the agenda at a short notice there 's nothing stopping any event provider from coming to you and saying we 've got this amazing idea can council consider it correct through the lord med that would be that 's really why the administration is seeking um the support from council for the increase to enable us to respond to those opportunities that come up at quite short notice just one follow-up question this motion is to guide the city is it not in its negotiation so what is an acceptable buffer outside of the percentage that we land on is it five percent will you entertain that and put it up to council is it ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just say sorry we 're not putting that motion up well see i mean i 'll just add my own team spot it would depend on the opportunity would it not i mean how do you know what the opportunity might be but anyway correct but i would imagine and i 'd seek advice from governance that outside of the quantum that anything would need to then come to council anyway and there is um a nod one final question because now i 'm more confused if we had the 50 guidelines in place and we had an application for 80 you would still send that to us correct what 's the point of moving this motion why don 't we put it at 20 uh to well as was mentioned with through the lord mayor as was mentioned with councillor lisa that it enables the city administration to have a criteria from which decisions can be made and reduces the time frames that can can go for matters coming to council another follow-up question under your procurement policy you can 't make a call at this level so this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that quantum ceo um i think i 'll now refer to the general manager community development i 'm getting myself all confused thank you through the lord mayor are you correct that the guidelines provide clarity for the community and also for officers doing the assessment of what is the scope and scale of the major events and festivals that council are willing to support that is using the council 's policy for sponsorship and grants but of course when applications come through having done their due assessment with officers there is discretion for council to make a decision as to what level of funding they do so that differentiation between what officers will assess has to i think be very clear in terms of your policy and in terms of guidelines and the opportunity for a council decision that may differ from that is always available to council thank you anything else councillor fleighton thank you the floor is yours if you want it that 's what we 're here for uh does anybody else have anything for or against the amendment no so we 're putting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes and i think further so this is that point two uh yes the motion be amended by replacing sixty percent with fifty percent all those in favor of the amendment that 's councillor fleeton councillor gordon and deputy lord mayor bain all those against uh it 's lisa coe gobert lord mayor and bevan so the amendment has been defeated five to three we return to the primary motion and who 'd open this up there so anyone in for or against no okay well sorry i 'm speaking for it um on the basis that i think we need to increase our events budget but i am perplexed as to why the council can 't if there is an opportunity can 't regularly engage with elected members about mega events or blockbuster events opportunities and demonstrate a proper return on investment for a visitor economy for me that 's where i think we should be making our assessments um for any application that comes before us not um because there is an opportunity for an event holder to come inflate their prices to get a better deal from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn it around to make it look like they 're actually um you know demonstrating value for money i think it just opens us up to an opportunity for fraud essentially but um if this is the only way that local government can operate um i 'm i 'm happy to support it thanks dlm ceo um through the lord mayor i suppose the case in point where the uh council policy possibly uh inhibited an opportunity and the decision was taken by council was the australia day example where um it was significantly higher than council had previously been asked to consider so wadea and so this really as the general manager has suggested provides the administration with the scope to look at the criteria which is also established by council or actually is established to support the policy and then council can change the decision and so on but it just gives a a basis and somewhat more of a rigor and i if i recall the present the arguments that were put forth at the time when that particular recommendation was not supported it was because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for so we 're we were asking council to make a bigger decision than one where there is this sort of scope available thanks ceo uh there 's a question then sure on that so what what is an acceptable variation you know in contract it might be 20 we have 10 variances where we put aside for contingencies what does the city view as an acceptable amount over that they would send to us see you i 'll send it to the general manager thank you with a submission for a major festival or event if it 's gone through the assessment if they 're asking for more we would still assess what within the scope of the 60 or 50 or whatever the decision is by council we would assess it against that and determine what would be value for money based on the information provided that then is later acquitted so in terms of the decision making for the assessment it is based on the information given as to their budget and the outcomes and deliverables we would be saying to anyone who rang us these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidelines is the guidelines so we will then present it back to council as we do with other submissions and the opportunity is there to accept the recommendation or to change the recommendation so even if it 's not accepted we can provide those submissions back through to council for them to have a different view if they choose like thank you but if it 's 20 higher do you say that 's too much if it 's 10 yes we 're allowed to kick this up to council when do you get to a point where we stop the process and just let the person know yeah through to the gm um but lord mayor i think if just to be clear on that so you 're suggesting if someone was to put something up that was 20 higher than the threshold that council wouldn 't even see that particular that 's the question so would would it even make its way to council if we declined it as a as administration certainly encourage submissions to be the best chance of of having success so the guidelines we give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be right outside the ballpark of what the operational guidelines are we would encourage dialogue to get them within the guidelines or to make a note in terms of we can get this delivered for this amount but in an ideal perspective we may be asking for more than the guideline amount we will work with people if it 's in the range i 'm hesitant to say a percentage because then i think you 're not being as clear for people in terms of saying this is the percentage that we 're looking at but there have been occasions in our history where we 've looked at something and gone the guidelines say this the value is so significant that we 're still going to note that so that is part of our customer and practice when we look at applications and we would continue to do that council of clinton nothing further um anyone have anything further for or against can i just i mean there 's an element of common sense here if an opportunity that is too good for the city to pass up then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we yes yes lord man like common sense yeah like you know yes hey lord mayor and councillors there 's something really good here you should have a look at this you 'd let us know through the lord mayor and to the lord mayor as the deputy lord mayor has said absolutely because you would probably find out about it through other means regardless right so we 've had and against we 've closed and we have no further questions so we 're going to put this to the vote all those in favor and we will declare that carriage unanimously let 's go thank you everyone let 's go to 12-2 strengthening heritage assets value proposition would somebody like to move a motion to deal with this item thanks council fleeton a second to please thanks councillor lisa uh council fleet thanks lord mayor so moving the officer 's recommendation on page 47. i 'll just make a few comments um page 54 in the report states on the demand side it 's understood from the original notice of motion that the city doesn 't need to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to experience and then it goes into however the recent study making space for culture 21 demonstrated a significant demand within the creative industries for space in the city and identified barriers to meeting this demand of individuals surveyed 84 are interested in having creative workspace in inner perth and 60 identified in the city of perth as their preferred lga however 75 of respondents identified affordability is the top reason preventing them from taking up space in inner perth the role of the creative industries in contributing to community vibrancy safety and economic growth is well documented i just want to reinforce that that 's a big part of why i moved this motion a few months ago i 'm not sure why the city used the word however because the market told us exactly that and that 's why the stats are there i just want to make a few points around the building eligibility as to the location i see this in itself as a trial if it works there 's nothing stopping your future council from expanding to new areas with new funds i actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can really make a difference in an area that sorely needs it i think the report nails exactly what we 're trying to do if council wants to expand the area please consider expanding the budget as you 'll dilute the impact to rendering the project toothless in what we 're trying to do in a big bold way over the next few months i 'd like to see some more information on the way that the city will score applicants i 'd like to work out the percentage of funds available as the report is ambiguous it uses languages like say five percent if you 're going to use a percentage like i was trying to get at the previous motion what 's the percentage so we can give people some surety there 's very promising research in the paper on page 55 that will come as the applications are invited in july despite that word however triggering me earlier i very much liked the report i think it was very well put together it was very well researched and i 'm very excited as to what we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second are there anything you would like to add uh anyone else wish to speak for the motion question i 'd like to move an amendment okay the point two c of the motion be amended to read as follows works area to be the status quo as per option a christian we need a second there please thanks councillor lisa she second at the substantive oh yeah yes can can do can do says our man at the top there we go so carry on thank you um mr chair um as i circulated the map to fellow elected members earlier today um i disagree with the position that the current status quo works area dilutes the impact i believe it is essentially the same area it just precludes people whose street frontage may be on a different street um i would prefer to see a sense of competitive tension better applications i see on the questions from elected members what happens you know if we 've got so many that we can 't um so many amazing applications that we can 't approve all of them it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grants and we can consider at that stage increasing the budget so i 'd like to see my my opinion is that having a greater pool of potential applicants will hopefully drive a better outcome um notwithstanding the opinion of the officers that it may dilute the impact thanks council gordon uh councillor lisa anything on the amendment um i think the amendment is sensible because there uh it would the what the option b that was suggested precludes williams street and what council gordon is suggesting in her amendment includes william street and i think it 's an important street to to look at in terms of heritage so that 's why i 'm supporting the status quo option does anybody wish to speak against the amendment council of latin thanks so looking at the map i mean i 'm looking at it now if you go down to st george 's terrace there are no buildings there that would be eligible that i 'm aware of up on williams street you 're looking at bankwest tower you 're heading into an area that 's already been redeveloped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do this if you like i don 't think it 'll actually make a material difference in the receipts to all the applications that we get my focus particularly with this project is barrack street and the malls that 's the concentration area of the upper level activation study that 's what i 'm trying to match in this but you can do this if you like anyone else would suspect for the amendment or against the amendment okay so we 'll now our councillor gordon um just to say to councillor clayton that i agree it 's a very minor change between the two largely based on the inclusion or exclusion of william street and saint george 's terrace do i know any of the top of my head that maybe may meet the criteria no does that mean that they 're not there no it doesn 't so i just prefer to include the whole area thank you thanks councillor gordon and we 'll put this to a vote now this is the amendment uh all those in favor of the amendment that 's councillor lisa councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord mayor deputy lord mayor councillor fleeton so the amendment has been carried five three five three okay so we return now to the primary and where were we uh counsellor yes who 's right okay council fleet have you spoken here yes you have council you 're having today yes um spoken a lot uh anyone else wish to speak for the motion anyone else against uh councillor fleeton all those in favor carried unanimously thanks everybody we moved to 12.3 commemorative works request centenary of air mail service langley park i had a question lord mayor and i apologize to my colleagues i should have asked this last week we just need to move her in a second i 'm happy to move it move it thank you seconder thank you councillor so question first is to the city is this the same process that applicants would use if they want a statute yeah if i could direct this to the general manager community development i think it is under the same policy for commemorative and methodology for how that gets done is could be a variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for plaques this had already been existing this is a commemorative policy under council policy are there any other applications pending for any type of statutes or plaques right now i have asked that today and the answer is no right thank you thank you now councillor fleet would you like to open debate here second there was councillor gordon nothing there uh nothing more anyone in favor wish to speak four or just eat four against council of fleet and you 're going to close no okay now do we need to wait for the deputy lord manager just kind of a bathroom break okay sorry to announce that otherwise you might be curious otherwise otherwise you might be curious as to know when the deputy law man is gone all right then let 's put it to about all those in favor and that is carriage unanimously i think uh 7-zip anyway and we moved now to item 13 items 13 infrastructure and operations alliance reports 13-1 variation to contract quadruple 0-1-8-19-20 specialized cleaning of car parks roads and footpaths part a would anyone like to move a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sec moving officer 's recommendation that 's the laser thank you councillor clayton uh question first a discussion point two on page 83 states that quite a delegation visited this area the ceo the lord mayor the acting commissioner from wa police along with various staff um i love this item but what i 'm hoping to understand is how much more money do we need to allocate in the next budget to do what we 've just done here across the city because this will not be the only area that 's correct oh ceo and that 's actually what is proposed and if i could invite the general manager infrastructure and operations because the administration would agree that this function and opportunity should be a regular plan for the entire city now to the general manager infrastructure and operations thank you ceo and to you lord mayor um we 've seen this cleaning trial is extremely successful and clearly we need to extend it to other parts of the city so we worked up we 're working up a plan but clearly we do not have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we 're going to have to defer this to the next financial year and work that into the program of works at that stage thank you the follow-up question the numbers that i 'm looking at per week or per month or whatever surely we can buy this equipment and increase how many people we 've got to use it and just the numbers we 're looking at here 300 000 for a weekly claim for james street is that what i 'm looking at thanks councillor flynn ceo and through the general manager infrastructure and operations through you lord mayor um the that three 346 350 4 000 um is for the existing contract and that 's to the end of its its terms so that 's that 's over two years so it 's not it 's not it 's not per week or per month that 's the total requirement to see us to the end of the contract but yes you do make a good point it is expensive so the alternative would be to in-source and to utilize our own equipment to do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we do not do that level of cleaning with with city equipment at this stage so it would require specialist equipment and specialist resources to to undertake that type of cleaning but it is an option to be considered so just a question from me through the ceo oh sorry counselor no you 're the lord mayor you asked me thank you that 's very kind of you um through your ceo so does our equipment it can 't do it or it it can 't do it currently it would need to be modified or we would need to add to its arsenal for for example one of a better phrase how would you answer that through you see here look i 'm not the expert on on on the on the cleaning equipment um i believe it 's the same equipment that is currently deployed by the external contractors um it would require um the training and the necessary skill sets to to do the work i don 't think there 'll be requirements for the modification of the equipment but that equipment is already doing other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of procuring more equipment to be able to fulfill fulfill the function across the city okay yes councillor fleet i 'm i 'm confused item 12 here on page 84 states the table below provides enviro enviro paths costs in accordance with the current contracted schedule of rates to provide ongoing cleaning of james street weekly 363 000 how could that possibly be correct to do it weekly over two years would cost 363 000 and we 're saying that we 've got the same equipment already that doesn 't make sense so let 's get an understanding of those figures firstly perhaps um yeah so through the general manager infrastructure and operations lobby yeah cheers thank you through your lorna the the the cleaning is roughly six thousand dollars a week is the number that i i have in my head i haven 't done the the calculation but it 's roughly that six thousand dollars a week to to undertake that that work and what we are suggesting is that we do it on a monthly rotation and to the end of the contract term that equates to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i was just going to suggest that 's under clause 13 in the paper i think that might assist at the bottom of that page yeah 13. uh the council leaves you the second if it 's anything you 'd like to say thank you lord mayor just to say that i was very encouraged to read that let 's say if there was a covert lockdown or something like that that the equipment could be tasked anywhere in the city so this this spend may or may not be always on james street so i take some comfort from that and i 'm happy to support this motion thanks council lisa uh does anybody wish to speak for the motion um so i will just say that uh one of the things the clean machine has demonstrated but also the deep cleaning that took place in james street is a how necessary it was b the results which were tangible we could see and how welcome they were from the community i think it 's also a reminder of these numbers in front of us how expensive it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important function of what we do and indeed most of the a lot of the feedback a lot of it is around safety as we know a lot of it is around cleanliness making our streets and our city cleaner and i think as well as a high priority on events and activations and safety cleanliness has to be right up there and i think in future we should be considering whatever is necessary to make our city shine and by that we mean clean footpaths that look noticeably clean and that our ratepayers think if they need something cleaned they can get it cleaned that is very important and an important part of our function happy to support also anyone else uh speaking for it my questions before so let 's clarify things for me but in the budget we need to see a comparison about buying this industry buying this versus paying these variations because what counselor lisa said i don 't think is correct if we wanted to retask it we 'd have to do a variation so yeah thank you through the lord mayor yes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the internal resourcing versus external i would also some there are the clarity around the costs are actually in the paper on clause 4 as well just just to make sure that we 're all clear on the weekly costs but um we can undertake that further examination of an in-sourced versus outsourced model yeah so to the general manager 's point before you recall the figure of six thousand at six thousand nine hundred and eighty seven dollars the three cleaning cycle was completed at a cost of six thousand nine hundred and eighty seven dollars um anyone else for wish to speak for against council of slate close nothing further let 's put this to the vote then all those in favour that 's carried unanimously thanks everybody uh 13 2 request for tender quadruple zero eight zero electrical lighting renewal uh council gordon 's leaving the chamber thanks councillor gordon uh infrastructure lighting upgrades just close that door that 'd be great and that one in cash has got bionic ears would anyone like to move a motion to deal with this item i 'm happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it moved first yep thank you and a seconder thanks councillor co so just questions first to the general manager so when applicants lodge a tender do they have to sign an agreeance of terms and conditions saying the price that we 're submitting today is valid for a period of time three six whatever months so usually our documents require that that there 's a certain period but specifically to the general manager infrastructure and operations thank you through the lord mayor so are generally our terms off on on 90 days in terms of the validity of the of the tender in terms of fixing and locking in the prices where there 's an extension of time required which is effectively in this instance the requirements procurement would send out to um to the tenders request an extension of time and therefore holding the tenders valid for for the revised period so we 'd have to confirm that that actually did occur because i 'm aware that the tender was it was was first put out to the market on the 28th of august or thereabouts and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to awarding the tender is beyond the 90 days but normally the process is that procurement would have extended the validity period to meet the time frames such that we can lock in the prices one final question page 34 actually it 's an uh it 's to do with a confidential attachment am i able to ask a question no it 's important so can i no i 'm not going to close the meeting for it i 'll raise it with the city after it 's not going to impact on my vote thank you so much happy to speak to them please um i had serious reservations about the matrix and some of the commentary from the panel about this the only thing that 's leading me to support it is the city has a long-standing relationship with the people and the business here that have already done works we cannot have another matrix and a scorecard and a tender assessment as bad as the one that we 've got before us not answering schedules running out of time not giving them more time things not being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of the market though with where contractors are at and how we 're trying to lock in prices now which is the overarching consideration for me moving this thanks councillor clayton the second was councillor co council co anything you wish to add uh anybody else wish to speak for the motion anyone else wish to speak anyone wish to speak against demotion council of clayton let 's put this to the vote all those in favor carried unanimously and if we could invite councillor gordon back in 13 3 is on block waste to energy 14 corporate services alliance reports 14 1 on block monthly financial report for october 2021 14 2 schedule of accounts paid october 2021 14-3 community group insurance program would anyone like to move a motion to deal with this item counselor fleeton thank you lord mayor i believe the city has my alternate motion i 'd like to put up that 's on the screen now so you 're moving an alternate motion here and we need a seconder for the alternate motion councillor gobert thank you council of slaton thank you just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i think the amended motion provides a buffer to future-proof the policy for premium increases and potential new eligible community groups that may come along all while ensuring community groups must shop around for the best deal on behalf of ratepayers the amendment is not to encourage groups to cover themselves for unnecessary amounts or cover types more to ensure the policy doesn 't need to come back to council and be amended later when it turns out we haven 't covered enough to start with from my research the previous amounts of two thousand dollars would not be enough for the basic cover required um overall the result of this motion takes away one costly barrier for our committed volunteer groups meaning the funds go towards the end product they 're all involved for and most importantly it acknowledges the value that this council places on their work and what they do thank you thanks councillor flint so this is for the amendment uh councillor robert alternate yeah alternate sorry alternate uh councillor going thank you lord mayor and just echoing councillor flayton 's comments um the commentary that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again this evening i think it 's quite clear that that two thousand dollars just isn 't enough quite and that a slightly increased amount could go a long ways to assisting community groups to do the work that they do um i 'm mindful that one of the comments this evening was that premiums might be increasing so i think it 's just prudent that we build in some long-term flexibility into the amount so i think it 's absolutely appropriate increasing those amounts under part a to 50 000 and part b to 5 thousand thank you thanks councillor governor anybody else wish to speak for the alternate motion for four yeah speak for the motion um as a former community group member chair i 'm very aware of how challenging it is to get insurance but i 'm also aware of how challenging it is to diversify the revenue sources of community groups and so from a city perspective while we 're very supportive of community groups i think that we should be encouraging them not to be mendicant on the city and to the extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good um i think balanced approach i 'm happy that it is for 12 months because i 'm not completely convinced that we that all community groups are created a like and i 'm not sure that just handing out five thousand dollars for eligible community groups per annum is necessarily the right solution but i 'm very happy to give it a go what i think would be a great alternative is to reward community groups for rewarding their communities by putting on more events so the more events you put on the more activation you have in your community the more you should be rewarded um and but we can cross that bridge in 12 months time when we have the assessment of this insurance trial thanks deputy lord mayor anyone wish to speak against the alternate motion uh council question if i may in whatever format this item is approved tonight what are the next steps from here because i appreciate that we 've added in the requirement for two quotes but two quotes for what we 've heard there 's various forms of insurance available is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in workers compensation cyber security is at events so when will this sort of process be in a position to be used we had questions last week pertaining to the timing and i think leslie rates it again the timing is not necessarily going to align so can they back date not not back date apply for funds already spent so when will that be considered thanks councillor gordon no ceo thank you through the lord mayor some of these issues would be um i think clarified before the beginning of the financial year so this paper is recommending the budget be for 22 23. i also take the point about the expansiveness of the cover and what would be necessary based on the sort of activities that a neighborhood group might undertake just to remind the um council that the administration when we were looking at this included public and product liability insurance volunteer workers insurance associations liability insurance and also so that were the three main areas issues around workers compensation and the like is another sort of add-on i suppose and that 's why the administration is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to really test how all of our neighborhoods may or may not undertake their insurance processes and really is i think prudent financial management in the first year of its operations to really for us to better understand we also did take advice and compared to other local governments this is quite generous even at twenty thousand and two thousand dollars per neighborhood group so we 're we 're really wanting to take this opportunity to learn and to work with the neighborhood groups as to what their insurance requirements are and thanks ceo councillor gordon um can i just in the interest of good governance for shadow the officer 's recommendation in the case this is lost um can i also just say that i actually think a hybrid of uh councillor clinton 's alternate motion and the officer 's recommendation would probably hit the mark for me i think if you apply the eligibility criteria we actually end up with the list of community groups that steve weilard went through tonight they 're quite um not onerous but they they do require um certain performance to date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a budget of four thousand dollars per group would actually arrive at a twenty thousand dollar per annum but i guess a twelve month trial will allow us to ascertain that and we can go from there thanks councillor gordon anyone else wish to speak for the alternate motion against the alternate motion uh council loser thank you lord mayor i think that point two of the alternate motion where council sweden 's added on the extra sentence subject to the community group sourcing at least two quotes i think that 's um it 's going to be problematic time-wise i think it 's going to be potentially unworkable in the current form so i 'm not happy to support that extra sentence thank you thank you anyone else for the alternate motion i 'm going to speak against the alternate motion on on this point only and that is that we 've identified the the numbers and we 've we 've talked about four thousand dollars that we 've heard from steve uh we heard a quote of or a figure of 2 700. i mean if we establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 4 thousand that would be twenty four thousand dollars so i must admit under the banner of prudent financial management for the first year the trial as i guess perhaps outlined them by the ceo i 'm reasonably comfortable with the twenty thousand dollars because i think i think the reality is that some of those community groups wouldn 't be making an application to us and therefore i 'm not sure that we 're gonna need to be at 50 000 based on what we 've heard from the deputations tonight um i mean if the deputations had spoken tonight and said they were quoting figures of six thousand dollars each or seven thousand dollars then i i guess i 'd understand that but to me we 're put the officers recommendations are pretty close to the mark and for a one-year trial one year trial i mean if we come back this time next year and everyone says well we were way under then fair enough we would consider it then but i i feel comfortable with what the officers have recommended on the basis that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard from the deputations tonight so i will be opposing the alternate motion on that basis anyone else for the alternate motion anyone else against councillor fleet thanks i 'm not too sure where i see the word trial um i thought we were moving a policy and the policy is more than a year so while it 's only 2.7 for one group now it could quite easily become 4.5 in future years and we 'll be doing this again and that 's fine um i just want to tackle point two um which goes to i think what councilor bain said we are not giving the group money and they 're spending it we 're getting two quotes and we 're reimbursing them for the expense hence the change to the policy four approves the application of a maximum funding limit like everything in our budget not every dollar is expended it 's a capped amount on that line item so the fifty thousand dollars uh i dare say would not be expended but the key part which you 've missed in the contribution was b a maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two thousand dollars doesn 't cover so why not go for five thousand to cover it when we 're not going to spend the full five if they give us an invoice for 3.7 we 'll pay 3.7 we 're not going to give them an extra cash of money and say spend that so i urge you to stick with what 's on the table now if you want to call it a trial because it will cover everyone that 's doing a lot of good work if you go with the office 's recommendation pretty much everyone that 's active will be underfunded so please don 't do that um sorry okay all right we 're going to put that to the vote then and that is the alternate motion all those in favor that 's councillor coe councillor gobert councillor bain councillor bevan councillor gordon councillor fleet knows against council loser and the lord man carrie uh five to two fifteen

those in favor unanimously uh 16 the committee reports we 've done that pardon me sorry right 17 motions of which notice has been given item 17 171 notice of motion councillor brent fleeton reforming the perth parking levy council of clinton has submitted a notice of motion regarding reforming the perth parking levy council of flint can you please move your motion i 'll get you to reserve your reasons until the motion is open for debate sure the council requests the ceo to compile a comprehensive briefing paper on reforming all aspects of the perth parking levy including rates area it applies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration at an engagement session prior to the next meeting of the city of perth committee to allocate fifteen thousand dollars for financial modelling from an experienced consultant with working knowledge of the parking levy and the city 's parking business thanks council of clinton is there a second up councillor gordon councillor fleet thank you uh so right now every non-residential car bay in the city of perth with the exception of netherlands and crawley pays a tax each year for the state government this is a flat fee which ranges from 1057 for street parking no matter where it is in the city 1144 each year for undercover public parking and 1189 for tenant bays to cover this for every hour a customer parks with us and pays 4.50 a dollar 20 of that goes to pay this tax further still the state government 's forward estimates show yearly increases of 1.75 percent this means every year we have to find an extra 380 thousand dollars for this tax increase if we want to keep parking fees the same the city itself is the biggest taxpayer in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fund to a fund which pays for the cat bus and other transport projects the problem is the fund is now sitting on an unspent balance of around 95 million dollars after expenses are taken out each year this inequity started with the wa liberals who drastically increased the tax as a past partial offset to their ballooning state debt while in government now at a recent engagement session it was clear from the state government that they are tinkering with this they 're actively looking at changing it um i was very concerned with that around what they 're going to change in terms of the rates per bay if they 're going to introduce a tiered approach so if they 're going to make the tax more expensive in cbd and then tier it out that 's obviously going to have a huge impact on our tax liability we 've also got a lot of conversations going on between our transport team their transport team their transport plan our transport plan two-way streets all of these things that are up in the air that could be solved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've lost the debate that the parking levy needs to come down so instead of keeping on about that which i will do regardless we need to have financial modelling showing what could be the ideal scenario for the city of perth if it was tiered sydney has a similar model and i think the modeling that we could get i 'm not too sure if we 'll be able to do it before the city of perth committee the motion is basically saying to the city get us the best figures you can i don 't want to spend 100 grand on this exercise i want to spend as little as possible but if we wait for the auditor general to come back to us if we wait for the state government to come to us they would have already made up their minds i 'd really like some work done even if it 's in the city through michael 's amazing spreadsheets which i i love um even if it 's through that getting some help from consultants on the side i think it will help us put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to government and say look we get it you 're going to have to keep this tax going this is what we would like to spend it on this is what the tiered system we would like in east perth and westbrook it makes no sense whatsoever to have the same tax applying to a car bay in east perth northbridge and sitting in the middle of town so some modelling on that would be appreciated thanks councillor clayton uh councillor gordon okay um does anybody wish to speak for the motion counselor just ask a question um has the auditor general given us an indication when something 's coming back to us uh so we wrote to the auditor general i think it was around midway through the euro perhaps a little earlier than that the letter received said that we would that the auditor general was going to undertake the body of work that we had requested and that we were likely to hear back towards the end of this year or in the first quarter of next year now clearly it 's not we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of this year clearly so we would expect to hear back uh based on that information in the letter in the first quarter of next year but there was no certainty around that and i do remember the letter clearly said that you know depending on what else comes up uh this can be pushed back in our schedule of work so there 's no certainty when we will hear back from the auditor general although the indication is the first uh quarter of next year i 've got that right ceo so anyone for or against was there another question councillor bevan i have a question please maybe to the general manager of planning and economic development um item six um decision implications it states there that um were exposed to risks could that be elaborated on place through uc and through to the general manager planning and economic development good question thank you and through you lord mayor i guess what that point is trying to make is if we 're going to try and build a very strong case that we want to put publicly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right so the purpose of that point was to say if there is an expectation that it is going to be a very comprehensive body of work then we need to do it properly and it may not be done in the shorter time frame but if there is an appetite from council to do some more rudimentary modelling just to give council an idea about what the implications of different scenarios would mean for the city then we can do that but it won 't be the comprehensive piece of work that we could ultimately do later on thank you general manager that 's well explained thanks councillor bevan for your question anybody we should speak for the motion against the motion council loser thank you lord mayor um and thank you to council fleet and for this motion there are many inequalities in the way that the perth parking levy is administered by the department of transport and one small example is the department of transport do not invoice the owner of the parking space the way invoices are addressed is especially problematic in this in a strata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department of transport addressed to the strata company not to the individual commercial strata lot owner the strata company as a whole is invoiced and pays not the lot owner the effect of this is the lot owners who do not own and certainly can 't use a privately owned commercial car space end up paying for it anyway this is very problematic in mixed-use strata schemes where is it especially unfair for residential owners to be burdened with the perth parking levy costs for commercial parking bays they do not own and cannot use there does appear to be work on this currently and i 'm glad the lord may and the city of perth have sought and ordered and it 's pleasing to see in the briefing paper that the city has already commenced the process of seeking legal advice to understand the process and consultation the state government is required to undertake prior to making any legislative change although i commend the spirit of council fleeting 's motion my opinion is slightly it 's premature to spend any more rate payers money at this point and especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper before the outcomes of the legal advice and the auditor general 's report are received thank you thanks council lisa um ceo can i ask questions i see there 's an amount of fifteen thousand dollars mentioned here um for the financial modeling from an experienced consultant with working knowledge of the perth parking levy and cities parking businesses so can you just give some clarity on that fifteen thousand dollar figure uh yes lord mayor and i think the discussion um just with the general manager planning and economic development and with councillor fleet and it 's suggesting that this is really a high level assessment and one which would be informative so it 's not a full-blown review rather something that will inform our conversations with the city of perth committee and also with the auditor general but there may be after this early piece of work and opportunity if council supports to do a larger body of work but that would come back to council correct correct for consideration so this gives us the opportunity to have some data to have some facts and figures when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrashing it out with uh okay is there anybody that wishes to speak for anyone else against sure dln um this perth parking levy is next to homelessness and anti-social behavior one of the biggest issues that is a conversation piece for commercial businesses in the city and for many years they 've been screaming out for action they 've been screaming out for this council to try and do something to put pressure on the state government to reconsider its position if there 's one thing history has told us is that governments don 't like to take away levies once a tax is in it 's in anything that we can do to put pressure and to [Music] illustrate to our ratepayers that we are trying to understand and reconfigure the impact of this parking levy is critical and um so that 's why i 'm i 'm very supportive of this motion we don 't have the time to sit back and kind of wait for some um activity from the auditor general who i 'm very respectful of um very respectful of the auditor general um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule to become available so that 's why i 'm very supportive of this motion and any other motions that tried to deal with the perth parking level thanks deal i appreciate that uh does anybody wish this week against i too will speak for it uh look i think many of us have advocated uh certainly in the merrell campaign back in the day seems like distant memory now but uh remember standing up at the property council and saying that the perth parking levy needs to either be suspended reduced or the money needs to be spent and none of those things have happened and we 've all been making those noises for our ratepayers and for our property owners in the 14 months since our election and that battle continues and this really just enables us councillor fleeton 's motion i think here enables us to continue our advocacy in this area deputy lord mayor is correct many of uh those of you around the table have expressed this view either in here or outside are also correct this is a significant issue and it 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh property work in the city they don 't like paying it it seems unfair and it is a very high cost particularly in the outer inner ring if you like west perth east perth etc down to netherlands crawley so i too i 'm happy to support anyone against wish to say anything okay just just a brief question um is 15 000 enough will it be enough ceo could i ask the general manager planning and economic development to answer that a little bit sure um thank you and through you uh lord mayor i guess the fifteen thousand dollars is um an estimate that councillor fleeton has put forward as a basis for the notice of motion we won 't know what it would cost until we actually get some quotes for the work we will need to see quotes for this work from consultants so it may not be 15 it may be slightly more it does depend on the scope i think if if we 're going to go all out it 'll be a bigger scope but if we 're looking at a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be a much tighter scope so it won 't be the 100 000 it 'll certainly have been down the lower scale but whether it 's 15 or 30 or 35 we 'll only figure that out once we get the quotes from the consultants okay thank you anything further from anyone councillor clayton councillor good can i leave an amendment yeah to delete item two of the motion do we have a second there thank you uh council gordon um i saw i think the mover of the notice of motion has made it clear that perhaps while the notice of motion states a comprehensive briefing paper it 's really a um best endeavors in the time given to position ourselves to have the conversations we need to have in this space in the time that we need to have them so proposing delete item two to leave that open for future identification by way of quotations okay uh council government thank you lord may just ask a question um without writing a blank check to the admin um is there an account or some sort of operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it need to come back to council to formally approve any expenditure so yeah through the law mayor i wouldn 't possibly attempt to answer that question if i could um ask michael kent to answer miss the spreadsheet here 's your chance uh thank you very much um through the chair i think um it is obviously important to have some sort of an indicative budget the the way that the financial management regulations work i would strongly encourage council to consider providing a budget as part of this recommendation because otherwise what you 're asking to do is not an existing budget line it 's an additional purpose under the act which would require us to come back to council for approval for the budget anyway okay seo and if i could add the procurement process for a uh process above the threshold of i think 50 000 would take more time than is available anyway so indicatively it wouldn 't be unreasonable to say so between 20 and 40 would that be if i 'm looking at both um michael can ask a question sure so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requesting that the ceo compiles the briefing paper you 've got a procurement policy at your disposal to approve any procurement with three quotes up to 75 000. perfect so that 's what you 've got which is why the suggestion by councillor gordon to delete the reference 2.2 would give us um sufficient scope if required yep uh okay so is there anybody else that wishes to speak for the amen who the second that you 've spoken oh i asked a question about the question if i could um so just for absolute clarity the removal of the 15 000 um don 't know the right way to put it but it 's pre-approving for one of a better word an amount of 75 000 up to 75 000 potentially is that the way that i understood percussive could i could i possibly see how it would happen so with the time frame that we 've set what would happen right now is the general managers team would go away do absolutely everything that they could without going external at the emes before the city of perth committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say this is where we 've got to here are three potential ways that we could scope a consultant to help us here 's how much it would be and here 's the time frame or not do that we 've got the information that we need to go to government and say how about we introduce a tiered system and start spending the money it could be as simple as that thank you councillor flayton and same question that i asked to the administration could i just get that advice from the admin are we limiting our ability to do this work or or are you comfortable that you can access 75 000 up to if you need to ceo thank you through the lord mayor so we have the uh procurement authorization i think what i 'm hearing from council is that we 're looking at some preliminary work around the tier approach to the parking levy we already have some data which we in-house can model so it really is then once we 've collated all that information determining if it would be better served that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we can bring to council is sufficient so we 'll only know that once we 've started the body of work the question wasn 't really answered do you are you comfortable that you could spend 75 000 if that 's what it took if that 's what you needed i wouldn 't be wanting to spend 75 000 given the baseline that 's been provided by in the notice of motion is 15 so i would feel it 's very difficult to predict but i think anything above let 's say 40 000 you 're looking at a much bigger project and the time frames and the scope are tight and short and so i would think anything more than 30 would probably would be entering into a completely different sort of project so i would expect it would be below 30 000. so that 's sort of like the point but can you confidently spend 30 000 then i i 'm just not sure when you need to what 's the question though is it so is it i 'm just mindful that if we 're taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see an amount in there and counts the fleet and saying but our procurement policy allows this i just want to make sure that we 're covering our bases and not going to trip ourselves up if in the event that the ceo does need to expend potentially 30 000. well i think we 've heard that that that is that is quite possible here and and can happen correct correct however for the time frames so i think up to 30 would be your problem it 's really difficult to predict exactly what the cost would be other than to say what you 're our chief finance officer is wanting certainty from his budget perspective and what i 'm suggesting is we have delegations through our procurement arrangements that we can go up to 75 i think if we move past a 30 000 threshold we are entering into a larger project because with the time frame for a consultant to spend 30 000 in that time would be quite um might not be the best investment for us thank you okay um yes sir sorry if i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you very much through the chair i mean everything that the ceo has just explained in relation to the procurement process is entirely correct 100 correct the challenge that we have and perhaps i should have been more explicit earlier is irrespective of the procurement thresholds we still need a budget line item so by removing the second point in that recommendation we don 't actually have a budget line to expend against notwithstanding that everything the ceo has said about our procurement thresholds is entirely correct yep definitely lord mayor but as is the case with other things you have put estimates in budget line items is that correct yeah through the cfr uh thank you very much i 'm through the chair the the situation is with um with the budget because you 're actually looking to expand on something that is not currently an existing identified line item of any sort you actually don 't have anywhere to spend against so all you would need to do to fix this is actually sorry if i may offer a suggestion is to actually reinstate 0.2 with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentially up to 30 000 which would then allow all the things you 're trying to achieve to happen in an expedient manner and in the event that it turned out that the bigger piece of work was required then we could come back and amend that budget line item okay thank you michael uh ceo do you want to say anything there good advice right okay so what are we planning now ask a question please just to keep this going two right now doesn 't tell us where the money 's coming from now we do have a line item in the budget it 's called the fund that keeps the liability for the perth parking levy which has a reserve and a buffer that grows over time taking 15 000 or 30 000 from that is not going to be indented the ocean but again i reiterate there is no plan to go out to a consultant yet we need to get the briefing paper from dale page 's team before the emas before the city of perth committee and then we work out the scope then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been blown out of all proportion uh thank you councillor clayton so we are we 're still debating the amendment council gordon will get the opportunity to close the debate in the moment is there anybody else speaking for or against councillor gordon um just to reiterate that by removing par point two of the motion that you 're removing both the budget allocation and as council things pointed out the request to engage an experienced consultant so it 's really basically ask a counselor asking for an engagement session on a highly relevant item which i think we should all support yes yeah i think we all support it i i 'm just yeah yeah uh so this is on the amendment we 're voting on the amendment and that is to take two out correct okay all those in favor uh ko gobert lord mayor bain bevin gordon and fleeton and those against councillor lisa that has been carried as amended seven to one back to the primary motion there don 't want to close yes all right the audit only looks back at how money has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice to find out the legal argument or the legal requirement is simply does the state have to consult with us it 's got nothing to do with modelling the motion is all about getting our best interests in order and as council gordon put it yes it is me asking for an engagement session on a highly topical issue but as we have just watched and so has your cousin in greece it is extreme sorry your sister increased it is extremely frustrating getting some things through this organization which should only come through this body in this room the other frustrating thing which i could not believe was the two transport officers one from the city of perth and one from the state government disagreeing on priorities for the city of perth in the same room so with what dale page is doing please find out a comprehensive list of projects that we can fund from this balance that state can take

well-earned break before christmas mania sets in and um it was just a fluke that the ceo and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new uniform although it could be a good idea very handy moving on to item number three on our agenda tonight in attendance we have councillor clyde bevin councillor liam gobert councillor rebecca gordon councillor catherine laser and councillor victor koh in addition can i welcome the ceo her fellow officers and any members of the public and the media that might be here and there are no members on an approved leave of absence besides the lord oh here 's an apology okay so there are no members on an approved leave of abs absence and um it is protocol for me to remind counsellors to please submit any applications for a leave of absence prior to next week 's ordinary council meeting item number 3.1 uh ceo do we have any apologies yes deputy law mayor we have received apologies from lord mayor basil zimples councillor angie and councillor clayton thank you item number four announcements well i thought while the cat was away i could take the opportunity and counselor gordon you can set the clock if you like but i promise i will not take more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today um i think it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge a couple of recent announcements that have the potential to significantly impact on the fortunes of our beloved city firstly today the state government announced it would throw more resources at tackling anti-social behaviour in perth cbd and northbridge it starts with a major endorsement of roof force the security personnel that we at the city have been working closely with since we were all elected just over a year ago they 'll be given nearly a million dollars by the state to roll out more security services and thank you very much to the state member for perth john kerry minister papolia and minister mcgurk for today 's decision it is warmly welcomed by rate payers and your council there 'll also be an increased number of police in jagan square which is a key connector of the city to northbridge and it 's home to some of perth 's best bars including the shoe and across the road my favorite the royal and there 'll be a two and a half million dollar upgrade to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd agree is a much needed investment um and there will be a new city working group to coordinate the roll out of this much much needed activity the other significant announcement of course was the highly anticipated reopening of our borders on february the 5th personally i 'm so excited about what this means for our hotel and tour operators in the city thousands of brand new hotel rooms have been waiting not just for the leisure visitor to return to western australia but for big conventions and big conferences to come and fill their rooms with a lucrative business traveler there 's no doubt in my mind that next year will be challenging as we learn to live with covert but getting back to normal or the new normal will present a huge economic windfall for perth and with our administration currently working on our economic development strategy the timing 's perfect for us to take advantage of some of the opportunities ahead of us and really start to think big so it 's exciting times ahead moving on to item number five public participation so public questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and item 5.2 is deputation ceo are there any deputation yes deputy lawman we have received two deputations in relation to item 14.3 thank you very much ceo we have a 10 minute limit for deputations if i could invite rachel thomas representing west perth local to please step forward to make your deputation rachel welcome hi guys welcome be kind to me this is my first reputation so um so for everyone so good afternoon i 'm rachel thomas so i 'm also actually outgoing vice chair of west perth local and now i 'm an ordinary committee member and i 'm actually also speaking on behalf of some other town teams northbridge common and the city of perth western residents now i 'm also a subject matter on this topic which is the community group insurance support program and for those that don 't know that i 'm an insurance broker i 've been doing that for over well i 've been a broker for about 10 years in industry for about 22 so i think out of all the parties involved i 'm probably one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so what i 'd like to say is as probably an overview because no two town teams are the same we all know this the cost for insurances will always vary throughout those town teams many of us have premises we need to ensure for their contents and glass and things to satisfy our landlords requirements which we all understand and then we 're also going to be certain events that are going to be outside of our regular public liability insurance so we 're going to have to go on and get separate insurance for those sorts of things as well the bigger the better which is what we really want which means more expense for us as well i personally always only recommend one particular insurer to other community groups for their public liability and that 's community underwriting aside from that the policy is designed for community groups they 've got the best claim service i know of their standard policy is very clear and concise when it comes to events and what you can have and what you can hold and i find i never run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose above that association liability and voluntary workers insurance which was outlined in the proposal are also the ideal but yes as most of us can 't afford that due to the cost i 've even had quoted our own town team and we 've decided not to cover ourselves for that due to the cost to my umbrage um these insurance are really there to protect us personally as we go about our town team business and often that 's an association with the city of perth we share the similar risks i would suppose for some of these things that we 're doing our team town team for example is primarily made up of full-time working professionals and so as an example the limits that we require on these voluntary workers insurance would be more than some of the outlines of the 750 dollars i would need two or three times that to match my wage and to be very honest one thing that wasn 't mentioned in the brief is that most of us should also have a current workers compensation policy we get a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grants we hold markets we hold stalls and we get other small businesses in generally sold traders and the like to come and work for us they are deemed our contractors if we don 't have a policy in place then we are likely in breach of the workers compensation act and with that comes some pretty hefty fines and penalties as well as public public naming as well on the website of being in breach so i think that 's just one thing that i think would be remiss if we didn 't also include that in the mix and i 've had a funny feeling most of us are probably breaching that at the moment as we stand so it 's a bit of a shock for the system for some of those as well and and being a good breaker i am i can 't go past cyber insurance at least to be considered i recommend to my clients to drop things like covering their laptops and take out cyber insurance i can 't emphasize this enough any one of our town teams who has a website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only that liability for the third parties which include everybody in this room as well as well as all those other stakeholders that we have connection with now pricing i would expect prices in the insurance market to increase to from what you 've had before and they 're going to increase a lot we 're in the middle of a hard market cycle and this is looks like it 's going to be going on for the next two or three years it is the bane of my existence as well i can 't tell you how much pressure that has put on me in my professional life this the a hard market cycle puts upward pressure on premiums downward pressure on coverages and it also takes the brokers that are administering those policies a lot more time to get things done so of course their prices will increase remember any claims that we have are going to increase the price as well but we 'll be paying for our insurance god forbid touchwood as i always say cheaper is never better and you pay for what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quality service at the start you obviously want good advice during the year and a comprehensive claim service i would say if we use the scenario of city of perth giving a set amount of funds like the two thousand dollars noted in the proposal that 's simply not enough we would need at least four thousand dollars and more if we have cyber and more importantly workers compensation insurance i probably wouldn 't break a model where the city of perth arranges the cover for us due to a lot of these previous concerns that i 've raised obviously they 'll know that they 're not qualified and they 're not a licensed agent i can 't give advice we understand that but it 's also fraught with breaches their own professional indemnity it 'd also not be possible to have a set price and limits scheme as it was briefly outlined as well this simply wouldn 't be an insurer that would bear to do this for the for up to 10 town teams they 'd probably need more like 100 too bad to have a set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could mean more buying power with the particular insurers that they 're using policies can also be common due dated and this can quite easily help fall in line with the city of perth 's funding requirements and time frames as well and i would also suggest a wa brokerage would be recommended as eastern states brokerages do not have the knowledge and or often licenses to advise and take out wa workers compensation policies so that 's all for some free advice from myself any questions thank you very much councillor laser thank you so just to be clear you 're happy with the city funded option that 's recommended in the paper but you think that the 2000 is woefully inadequate hopefully and that should be increased to as you say 4 000 or is that still not enough i think ultimately if we have everything that is recommended a breaker has to recommend what their clients risks are yes yes it would be very helpful there 's going to be some of those that maybe don 't need a workers compensation policy but i don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would love to take out a cyber policy um so that just means that four thousand dollars could pay for the bulk of those policies and then anything over that we can obviously fund out of our own funds i have a question if that 's okay um did you as west perth local did you are there things that you haven 't done because insurance has got in the way of doing a community activity um i think it 's in the planning of the activity um even as as most recently as today we 're looking at some of the grants fundings that we want to do and to get the money we want for something we had have a minimum of a thousand participants for example to maybe get a twenty thousand dollar grant or a fifteen thousand dollar grant that is woefully outside of our five hundred dollar limit we can get extra but then it 's just an extra layer of cost and difficulty that often you have to weigh up if it 's really worth it so we do try to stay under those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean 500 is a lot i get but it is it is something that stops us from being as big and as bold as we 'd like to be catholic oh thanks for coming to speak to us um insurance is something i 'm always um uh struggle a bit with trying to get my head around can i ask you with the west perth local do you have insurance now yeah and do you mind me asking are you allowed to show us how much you pay well not really um i don 't have it right now what we pay it 's probably two thousand dollars i 'd say um from memory but bearing in mind um that does cover a little bit of that glass cover we only have public liability insurance and some glass cover little bit of contents to throw in to satisfy our landlord um but you 're looking at about the three the two thousand dollar mark for that yeah anyone else no thank you very much and um can i just add that we 're very i think all of us as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're very appreciative of the volunteer work that you do for our city um it 's not easy to be a volunteer in a community group i was one for many years and so we appreciate all the all the work that you 've done for west perth and west perth local thank you thank you so if i could now invite emily tilbrook representing the east perth community group to step forward and make your deputation thank you thank you deputy lord mayor councillors and ladies and gentlemen my name is emily tilbrook i 'm the vice chair of the east perth community group and i 'm speaking today on behalf of east birth community group committee i 'm going to be saying very much similar things but on a slightly different track because it 's very focused on things from our perspective of the east perth community group so thank you for the opportunity opportunity to make this reputat representation to the council with respect to the council exploring options for the community group insurance support program to cover the cost of insurances for community groups in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has close to 900 members just giving a bit of setting the scene for what we insure we have active committee of eight and several working groups comprising approximately 40 regular and active volunteers our shin digs and community meetings also regularly attract about 100 or so members over the last several years the east perth community group has applied for sponsorship from the city of perth for a variety of events and activations the cost of ongoing administrative expenses such as insurances are specifically precluded underneath those city policy sponsorships which you guys would all be very aware of insurance has repeatedly been mentioned as an issue for us either in relation to insurance costs or the relevance of the coverage of the activities of the group in some cases we doubt if we could obtain suitable insurance for instance if we were to pursue grants to install parklets there are concerns regarding the insurance coverage for the installation of the infrastructure the more we look into those kind of issues we um considering infrastructure like this in the community the greater the concerns we have around insurance they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover the and factor in that stuff but that 's an ongoing insurance concern for us as well affordability of insurance is a critical issue to us as we need to provide financial protection and peace of mind for our members volunteers and participants the east perth community group shares the same broad concerns with insurance as the other neighbourhood groups west perth local northbridge common in the city of perth western residents we 've all had email communications throughout the week it 's pleasing to see that as a part of your investigation the city consulted other local government authorities who have noted who have noted provided similar incentives and that you 've obtained information on relevant and available insurance policies for community groups and cost estimates we note that it would be useful to see in greater detail greater detail regarding these investigations so we 've not been able to find adequate insurance cover to cover cover for the cost as low as those that you guys have quoted that you have been quoted to you it would be interesting to see the details of the policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us greater insight into how other jurisdictions manage this our current insurances are two thousand seven hundred and seventy six dollars and twenty two cents and it 's cheaper than the 3 540 we were initially quoted and it 's actually cheaper than previous years for us however it doesn 't include workers compensation which we have recently identified as a shortcoming and we 're also mindful that insurance premiums are likely to increase and therefore the cost is only likely to increase over time because of this we would like to highlight the two thousand dollar grant while very very welcome would not cover the current insurance rates for us we estimate that the two thousand dollars shared between ten groups on your breakdown of costs comes to about one thousand eight hundred and thirty dollars per group including gst and two thousand and thirteen dollars in so not including gst and 2013 dollars including gst as a as a lee as that therefore leaves a gap in the amount we we currently pay and the proposed grant amount would likely be even greater with workers compensation and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a bit short for this microphone whilst we welcome the cost for insurance would the council consider an option where the amount available will be varied according to the size of the membership and the number of volunteers and finally we have questions regarding timing current grant guidelines don 't allow for reimbursement of previous expenses we will welcome some clarity around this in the guidelines especially as insurance renewal periods may not align with grant timelines in closing we want to be clear that we are very appreciative of the consideration the council is giving to funding insurances for community groups and only request further consideration being given to the current and projected costs we incur to obtain adequate coverage thank you wonderful thank you very much does anyone have any questions for emily no emily we thank you for stepping up to be vice chair of east perth community group it 's a big task and we really appreciate the work you do as well and thank you for coming down this afternoon thank you very much thank you so moving on to item six on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received yes deputies loaned me the following interests have been received an impartiality interest from councillor lisa in relation to item 12.3 as charles kingsford smith was her great-grandfather 's cousin and a proximity interest from councillor gordon in relation to item 13.2 as her apartment is adjacent to his majesty 's car park i hope that means you get a stake in sydney airport council lisa thank you very much ceo are there any disclosures of interest from the floor nope wonderful items uh agenda items seven to ten will be dealt with at the ordinary council meeting next week uh reports we now move to the reports as we move through the reports i 'll ask if any councillors have questions in relation to the items item number 11.1 fenced off lead dog park investigation are there any questions councillor gordon thank you madam chair just one additional question to the one submitted earlier regarding what people 's expectation may have been when they submitted feedback that they wanted the ozone reserve to be expanded like would they have had the context that there were limitations on such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand and more spacious ceo if i could ask the general manager planning and economic development to answer that question thank you through you deputy lord mayor i think the intercept survey certainly were more conversational with people on site and i suspect but i can confirm that that additional information was provided i 'm not entirely sure whether the exact extent of the expansion that 's now captured in the report was actually socialized at the time of consultation i can confirm that but i believe certainly it was whether or not there 'd be an expansion whether you 'd support an expansion or not but the exact extent of that i 'd need to confirm council lazy you 're happy with your questions question answered excellent we 'll move on to item number 12.2 strengthening heritage assets value proposition sorry 2.1 major events at oh festival sponsorship any questions on this item 12.1 in there if i recall i had a six months application time council bevin yes yeah um i believe that 's probably too long um i would suggest that three months would be more appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afl uh we didn 't have six months to prepare for that and i think we need to be agile and have the ability to make decisions a lot quicker than six months did you want to ask the administration a question or was it just a statement it was yeah probably that was a comment could i ask the question is that possible to break it back to three months or a shorter period of time ceo so if i could ask the general manager community development to answer that uh thank you through the deputy lord mayor the current guidelines the first six months are because the predominantly major events and festivals relate to national and international events so for that kind of scale we 'd expect that there 's quite a lot of activity approvals traffic management alike so in an ideal world yes the six months would be our suggested response we can however put in the guidelines that there is some degree of flexibility follow-up question oh that 's fine thank you thank you councillor co you have a question uh this is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are there any particular events in mind that some of these changes propose here would would benefit ceo do you have any particular events in mind um i think with regards to the percentage it 's really looking at attracting which is actually point number two in the recommendations attracting some of the larger events if i recall last year there was an opportunity for council to consider the wa day opportunity the guidelines did limit the potential to attract or at least match the funding that would have probably attracted them to the city rather than where they currently are so it really gives maximum flexibility do you feel that answer your question counselor co counselor laser yeah sorry um sorry counselor co i actually don 't remember was this discussing the engagement session i feel like i don 't i 'm not very familiar with it um would you like to answer that ceo if i could ask the general manager community development to respond oh thank you the event strategy uh the 2025 event strategy was endorsed by council in may earlier this year so it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more facilitated events that actually is our priority in our event strategy to have a facilitator role rather than a market-led role or rather than a city-led role so as part of that conversation and preparing for the budget we 've had discussions uh as recently as last week in regards to what is the desired outcome for major events and festivals noting as we have in the item the expenditure that 's all been already been allocated out for the 1.18 that 's been allocated in the budget so the discussion in this sense for the item is about ensuring an in-principle agreement for a stronger budget and for stronger percentage involvement by the city in terms of sponsorship so that we can then go out to the community and say that the organization is committed to the event strategy does want to see more sponsored uh market ledger proposals through and that will then give us hopefully some more proposals coming through because as we 've said in the item the events that we 're seeing although we want to be the capital city and events heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events come through at this point in time that we would like so that 's why the recommendation is on the table for consideration and i 'd also quickly note that because major events have to as you as you 've pointed out council like um bevan give at least six months notice so we 're talking about major events that 's part of the reason of putting this up now so that we can go back out to the market and say there is going to be a more significant budget in this particular area thank you can i oh counselor laser go ahead thank you through the chair i had a question about the budgeting so i had a response to my question which was good but it also says that council should should should we agree to this motion we need to determine where the money comes from basically so what would be the next step to determine where the money would come from in the budget thank you ceo so this will be part of the budget conversation that we 've already commenced and um looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it 's to be determined by council councillor co sorry again about the uh where the money is going to be coming from will it be subtracting from things like um like um the art sponsorship or the music music festival sponsorship those sort of things will be subtracting from those other areas ceo um again it would be from the broader budget so it may well be that there 's a capital project that doesn 't have a priority it might well be within the existing grants and sponsorships it 's a sum of money that would be looked at from the entirety of the city budget so it 's at this stage i can 't advise specifically where the money would come from thank you and ceo if i may ask a question is this pool of money the kind of money that we would be dipping into if there were blockbuster events at optus stadium that we wanted to capitalize on as a city like we did with the afl grand final and the people 's parade as it relates to acting activating the city again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council decision so we would hope that it would be anything that um activates our city so would it be from this pool of funds this would be for major events there are other funding pools for different um whether it be something it 's difficult to predict but based on whatever the request is then the funding would come from whichever allocation was appropriate so i think the budget allocation that we had just to follow up was 300 or 400 thousand dollars for the um grand final parade is that considered a major five no i think council gordon wanted to increase it to five thousand but we 500 000 but we didn 't do it did we or did we anyway um is is that considered a major event budget that could be something that would be drawn down from the major events yes thank you any other questions no thank you very much so item number 12.2 strengthening heritage assets value proposition are there any questions from councillors on this item councillor gordon thank you um sorry what i forgot to ask earlier with regards to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status quos were actually reducing the number of streets of which properties can apply and i just wonder whether doing that will reduce the pool of applicants and potentially mean less competitive tension and that we wouldn 't be giving it to people that could achieve greater things ceo so this is in relation to 12.2 and i have the general manager community development as able to respond to this question uh thank you through the deputy lord mayor in the attachment we do articulate why our recommendation is to actually tighten up the area for the number of streets it is a decision for council it is a recommendation of the officers that we would get more impact by having a smaller area that 's designated for these this type of support so that really is the rationale and through some of the benchmarking that they 've done and it which is also included in the attachment so there is a level of rationale of why it 's recommended but ultimately it is a council decision thank you very much any other questions on that item no we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of air mail service langley park noting the impartiality interest from cath councillor lisa and her ancestor are there any questions on this item no okay moving on to item number 13 13.1 variation to contract zero zero zero zero one eight nineteen slash twenty specialized cleaning of car parks roads and footpaths part a thank you for that sexy title any questions on this item you 're happy with the answer for your question counselor laser yes thank you wonderful item number 13.2 requests for tender another sexy title zero zero zero zero eight zero electrical lighting renewal infrastructure lighting upgrades uh any any questions on this item and council laser you are happy with your questions yes thank you excellent item number 13.3 waste to energy uh any questions on this item counselor gordon you 're happy with your responses no questions item number 14.1 monthly financial report for october 2021 are there any questions on this item no thank goodness michael kent 's not here or is he oh okay um item 14.2 schedule of accounts paid any questions on this item no we 're zooming through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this item counselor lisa thank you we had heard from the deputation and it is in the papers that the modeling was done on 10 community groups but we don 't know of that many i don 't think we know of that many in our city can we just have some uh commentary about that please ceo if i could ask melissa murphy the acting general manager of corporate services to respond thank you and through the chair um yes a list was provided to us in terms of the groups that we commonly interact with at the city i have a list if you 'd like me to let you know whom we um we considered we considered activate perth big n city of perth western red residents association classical collective uh classical catchment group eastern perth community safety group historic heart incorporated love east perth northbridge common on william rotary club of elizabeth key west perth local and with one voice perth north bridge residents association and williams street collective the group was not meant to be exhaustive it was an indicative list at the request of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what a typical group might be considered for insurance so it wasn 't overly specific or prescriptive it was provided as an illustrative group thank you very much for that response i have a follow-up question if it 's okay um are the majority of those groups groups that have actually sought funding from the city in the last 12 to 24 months groups like on william begin um can i refer that query onto our community development area please three year deputy lord mayor not all of those as far as i 'm aware have received funding through local activation grants or the like we can provide a detailed summary for elected members if you like thank you i 'm just curious as to the status of some of them and if um if they exist did you speak to them is there a ceo or a managing director that you engage with maybe if i could take that question deputy lawman from the insurer 's perspective they really want to get wanting to get an indication of the types of groups we 're talking about so when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with a common uh cause or agenda may not necessarily be needing insurance so for the purposes of demonstrating to the insurers the types of groups that have existed in the past what their terms of reference are and what their scope is would have been informative for the insurer to reach an estimate as far as what might be a a a um a premium that could be paid so some of those groups that have been referenced haven 't actually operated for some time but for a period of time they may have they might have had different agendas i think for the purposes of this paper we 're also very interested in ensuring that it is a group of people who would need insurance which usually means they have to do some activity that needs a coverage that 's why i think that will ensure that those organizations that are delivering services to the community are the ones that we 're covering rather than groups who may have common interests but not necessarily delivering to community if that makes sense thank you very much councillor gobert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on some of the commentary this evening um are we able to get some advice or can i get some advice from admin on what a tier one and tier two insurance scheme might look like so that we 've got um the that grant amount that would address the smaller groups like the william street collective and the other ones in east perth and then looking at the top tier or our identified neighborhood groups like west perth loboy 's perth local northridge common activate perth and the city of perth western residents association so could i just have some commentary about how tier 1 tier 2 might look ceo thank you and we would take some advice from the insurer i think coming back to my point that those organizations that deliver activity or services are the ones that would require um or would be eligible for this payment i 'm not certain um of some of those other groups what their serve why they would need insurance so i 'm not even certain that they would be it would be necessary so maybe if we get some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked and maybe arrived at a premium and then if there is a tier approach to the premium payments because take your point some of the community groups are very large their risks are higher so usually and i 'm there 's a broker in the room i 'm acknowledging better place to work out how an insurance premium is arrived at but risk is at the basis of it all thank you councillor lisa um thank you dm the point made by the east post community group about the timings so are we able through this policy to reimburse something that 's had to be paid urgently ahead of ahead of our process here ceo it would be that the invoice would be provided to the city and then the payment would be made so it wouldn 't be as i anticipate on an annual basis because everyone 's insurance premium can be have different dates so unless i 'm wrong on that and i 'm now looking to the general manager corporate services but it would be a recouping arrangement so payments when the invoice is received yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendation which is that the preferred method um is to take on a a funding approach that is a city um um administered or depending on which approach we take we can then look at what the appropriate method might be including a reimbursement so at the moment one of our recommendations to you is that we look to do a fund that is city administered funded sorry thank you very much for that response any more questions counselor gordon thank you um with regards to the feedback from the deputations that the uh two thousand dollars per eligible community group is not sufficient is there any reason why we can 't maintain the twenty thousand budget but allow up to four thousand dollars per community group and then have criteria either a tiered system like councillor gobert said or varying amounts given ceo um we could actually look into that over the next between now and the council meeting because um agree with the point that you 're making some of the community groups are larger their premiums would be higher because their risk is higher so if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some community groups won 't go up to the 2000s so there could be a way where we work with the insurer to arrive at that variable premium based on each group so if we could take that on notice and provide advice back thank you very much uh councillor bevin through the chair if i may my answer might have just come actually have we considered the formula for distributing the money considering you have um different populations different memberships different degrees of exposure to each of the groups so is that something that we 've looked at and considered ceo so we haven 't looked at each individual and what a premium might be for each individual community group but we will go back to the city insurer and seek some further advice as to whether their camp whether that would be you know how it might all wash out yes thank you councillor gordon thank you and there was some good advice this evening from our resident broker um i was just wondering i assume there 's a reason why the city when giving this grant couldn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurer for the recipients there might be like a governance issue with regards to doing that ceo so the city actually is insured by the local government insurance scheme so that is actually i suppose is a is like a broker really and they have a very they mostly um ensure local government so they have a very uh understand the context of local government but i 'd if i could send to the general manager corporate services because that might be the city 's insurer but i 'm not certain in this regards to this recommendation yes thank you uh at the minute our insurer has advised us that um uh we should probably um not um uh recommend an insurer uh that the advice that we 've been given is that the um that we don 't want to sort of be in the space of being an insurance intermediary um and making our recommendations about what insurance or what sort of insurer the group should go to because of their own specific circumstances and risks thank you very much does that answer your question thank you any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responses we 'll move on to item number fifteen point one draft strategic community plan twenty twenty two 20 20 32 public consultation counselor laser were you happy with the responses to your questions um thank you dlm there was one question in regards to energy use so um we 've got water use measures in here and some other environmental sustainability measures but we 're not doing anything about energy use so the answer to me is should it be considered appropriate for this goal to be included at what point does it get considered is my question ceo it might well be that that energy use is something that is captured in the sustainability strategy which is currently under development so i would recommend that might be a more appropriate strategy does that answer your question yeah thank you any other questions on this item nope we 'll move through to item 15.2 the nomination of elected members to the library board of western australia if we can just note that the recommendation is seeking a nomination of three elected members so if you 're interested in nominating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item nice wonderful item

you that 's 9-0 for those keeping score um let 's go to announcements i 've got some really good news here and some news that i 'm very enthusiastic about and it is my belief as you might know listening to me or following me on social media that the great things happening in the city of perth far outweigh those things that are at times challenging and we are aware of the challenges but there are some exceptional things happening within the city of perth i can tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ christmas lights trail which we received today shows what we have all seen for ourselves and certainly that i 've been saying the city boom is on people get on board two weeks ago i cut ribbons to open piccadilly arcade a number of new vendors at perth city markets i noticed jeff lee sitting at the back and the christmas lights trail all off the back of announcing we 're re-embracing the city of light tag and we 're going to stage a weekend of celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of john glenn 's orbit and that famous tag in february of next year this saturday the christmas pageant comes back to the heart of the cbd where it should be right down st george 's terrace how magnificent the 50th anniversary of the christmas pageant in the year of my 50th birthday by the way and 32 degrees is forecast it 's going to be a glorious day in our city in short and the numbers back this up there are more people in the city and those people are spending more money compared to the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less in other local government areas by approximately five hundred and twenty five thousand dollars that means and if you 'll bear with me perth residents are shopping local and spending more in our city of perth local government area according to the data which we received only a few days ago expenditure is 20 million dollars a month higher in october 2021 than it was last october i 'm going to say that again slowly 20 million dollars higher this october than it was last october that 's up 7.8 percent year on year for the month of september total spend was 234.8 million dollars a 7.9 increase for the same time last year resident local spender was 12.9 million visitor locals spend 221.9 million what this tells us as i said residents are staying in the city to spend they 're spending less online and they are buying locally and there are more visitors in the city the august night time economy expenditure was up 25.5 this year compared to last year and that was before afl grand final week and pedestrian activity or as i like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in 2020 and for the first two nights of the christmas lights trail the number of visitors on friday nights is up 35.4 compared with the first two weeks of last year and the saturday attendance saturday night is up 38 with the first two saturdays of the corresponding period last year that big big jumps 35.4 and 38 parking who would have thought councillor fleeton parking has been a massive determining factor because i can proudly sit here and tell you that parking in the city is hassle free hassle free my friends can the shopping centers say that no they cannot they 're giving out uber vouchers to ask people to leave their cars at home we don 't have to do that here we 've got great car parks that people are taking advantage of a flat rate fee of five dollars at night time a ten dollar all-day parking fee at select car parks and on weekends and public holidays three-hour free parking in car parks close to our shopping heart three of our best the cultural center pier street and his majesties there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on also we just launched downstairs our lgbtqi plus plan it lists and brings together all of the things the city will be doing in this year of the 30th anniversary of the pride parade and our city staff proudly represented us including councillor lisa councillor gobert and the ceo michelle reynolds and we thank them for doing so with their city of love t-shirts a reminder event sponsorship applications close on the 14th of december and there have been many received and that service is providing great opportunities for ratepayers in our city the stolen generations memorial the maya myers was opened in wellington square only last week a very significant piece of public artwork that reminds us all it is important to reflect and to respect a place where all australians can come together learn from the past and move forward together and i 'm especially proud to say that today marks six months since our safe night space in hay street east perth opened in the six months that that facility has been opened catering for the most vulnerable in our community there have been and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women 2 318 presentations that 's an average of 13 women each night taking shelter coming out of the cold the rain and out of danger off the street and into our safe night space facility last night there were 16 women who took shelter this has been a very significant step forward in this space for our community and on behalf of all elected members i 'm very proud of what we have been able to establish in its first six months of operation just finally i had the opportunity this week to visit the borough biddy meyer facility on wellington street as our councillors and many people listening will know we 've advocated strongly for the state government to enter this interim homelessness space and i will say that it came off the back of our work opening the safe night shelter for men the two-month trial and as a result bulu bitty maya was opened i think ahead of time i was delighted to see that 24 residents are cared for in this facility and i 'm told that that number will soon move to 40 residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional staff are advocating as hard as they can to increase their capacity when the time is right and that is certainly something they are moving towards and i want to congratulate all of the staff that i met there and have the opportunity to be shown around that great facility which we hope will continue to expand and continue to work towards the full use of the 100 beds that they have available so as you can see it has been a very busy period there is a lot to look forward to and there are great things happening in the city of perth and every elected member and every staff member of the city of perth should be very pleased and proud with some of those great achievements the city was also recently awarded gold at the perth airport wa tourism awards in the major events and festivals category for the christmas lights trail 2020 and how lucky brad 's here to be able to hold that up like that on cue this category recognises tourism leisure festivals events and exhibitions which enhance the profile and appeal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a positive economic impact increased visitation and community involvement as a gold medalist the city of perth will advance to represent our state at the national qantas australian tourism awards it 's fantastic acknowledgement of the success of this signature event for the city of perth at a state and national level you know my belief i think it 's the best family event that we do in the city and it 's been wonderful and we 'll see them again when we leave tonight how many families and how many people are enjoying our christmas lights again and the city has won two australian institute of landscape architecture wa awards for the east end revitalization and high street pedestrian priority precinct it 's incredible danny all sat there for 12 months never held up a trophy once wow the awards were for excellence for infrastructure and landscape architecture award for urban design the project involved almost every single

deputation ceo are there any deputations yes lord mayor we have received one deputation in relation to item 17.1 so can i tell you that thank you ceo please be reminded there is a 10 minute limit for deputations and i 'll now invite callum ashton representing prop tech hub wa and jeff leach to please step forward to make your deputation i might just check is it just callum giving the deputation it is callum come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to uh state your name and your address thank you thank you lord mayor deputy mayor and council members color mastering level 2 110 williams street perth i probably won 't need this and i 'd like to start with uh saying i love perth i 've been to every single capital city in australia every state every territory and perth is number one i love it and the change that you have made over the past few years has been absolutely amazing and um thank you so much i want to share my deputation on the tech plan and why i feel that it 's important now i 'm not going to start with with saying 50 years ago the biggest company was steel telephone telegraph and standard oil because we know in today 's year the three top apple amazon facebook all tech we know how important tech is having in our community in government in business and in residential it 's why our ratepayers can listen to this tonight is because of technology but where is tech going to take us into the future and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line outside this room queuing up to help lord mayor deputy mayor and the councillors to help with a plan of technology and to help earth be the tech capital of australia but how do we do that and how does it look we 're hoping that city of perth can have the leadership and we will follow prop tech it 's not a prop on a stage and sometimes it does get confused for that it 's short for property and construction technology we have been open for 286 days we have 30 property and construction technology businesses that have joined so far and we have over 100 industry members the combined value of our innovative members is over half a billion and our industry members over 250 billion we 're putting on several events in the city and have already attracted over 10 000 people 26 of those 30 members were not working in the city and now they come here and they work and they 're members and they get involved we want to do more and as the lord mayor has said it 's not about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do for the city and we want to help we want to do what we can for the city thank you thank you thank you callum appreciate that very much and appreciate the time as well you can stay there if you don 't mind because there might be some questions from our counselors um so again thank you thanks for being here tonight are there any questions from any of our councillors councillor gobert thanks for the deputation um with regards to other australian capital cities you said you 'd been to all of them what do you see as our biggest inhibitors to being australia 's tech capital looking at other capital cities yeah so brisbane sydney and melbourne their local councils city councils are really backing tech they provide a serious plan with serious grants and that 's allowed to get the investment there which has then attracted the talent that 's we 've done a brainstorm on what do we need exposure is one of them capital is one and we have set up an investment council and we 'll be deploying capital next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we don 't really know where we 're going and where the city wants to go and that 's why um if the city had a tech plan there there was so many people out there that would would line up and help thanks callum councillor gordon no you 're leaning forward to push your butt no you 're allowed to lean forward here it 's a democracy a counsellor co uh thanks for speaking to us um you mentioned did you say 27 people 26 26 26 members out of 30 didn 't work in perth before but now they 're working yeah they come to birth yeah that 's fantastic um do you do you foresee your company to be growing even further absolutely so july next year we 'll be doing a prop tech accelerator program for land developers builders both commercial and residential and real estate agents and they come in with a big idea with their big problem and they network with the innovators and that creates these entrepreneurship opportunities and then that will take our 30 prop tech members to 40 or 250 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where all the action is hey yes council co follow up just a follow-up question do you employ anyone from um like new graduates from university in any particular fields or anything like that what we do actually we have a work experience program that leads into an internship program so we had over 20 now go through the work experience program and successfully employed four through the internship program they have come mainly from ecu and curtin university are there any further questions from anybody and callum can i ask if if we had a strategy out for public consultation to inform the plan by early next year would that be a good result it would it would and we love perth that 's why we 're all here and it 's perhaps the strategy of how do we get perth to be number one because we can do it we have the industry and we have the backing and if you had the opportunity to feed into that strategy to to give input would you would you take part in that process absolutely okay that 's excellent um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much thank you a little merry christmas thank you

the 26th of october 2021 thank you councillor bevan can i have a seconder for this motion i thank you councillor coe who got his hand up quickly that 's very good uh show of hands all those in favor this motion being unopposed i will declare it carried unanimously questions by members which due notice has been given i do not believe there are any no correspondence has been received item 10 is petitions no petitions have been received so we move on to the reports and i 'm moving a motion that the following items be carried on block 13 1 rft triple zero eight threes per for sure principle shared path and lighting upgrade works 14-1 monthly financial report for september 2021 14-2 schedule of accounts september 2021 14-4 corporate business plan quarter one report i could have a second uh for this please thank you councillor gobert uh do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declare it carried unanimously the recommendations of those items have now been passed on block in accordance with clause 9-2 of the city of perth standing orders local law 2009 and the officers recommendations have been adopted by council we 'll now be moving on to the reports extracted for debate 11 and 12 nothing there 13 infrastructure and operations alliance reports as we just heard 13 1 is on block 14 won the monthly financial report for september 2021 on block also 14-2 schedule of accounts paid september 2021. so we got a 14-3 infrastructure capital project re-prioritization for november 2021 would anybody like to move a motion to deal with this item thanks councillor gobert a seconder thanks councillor lisa uh council of god anything you 'd like to say council laser anybody wish to speak for or against the motion uh does anybody oppose the motion uh there being nobody opposing the motion will declare that carried unanimously 14 4 corporate business plan quarter one report on block 15 chief executive officer reports 15 won the inquiry of the city of perth recommendations quarterly progress update so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but i know the officers have it the council notes the quarterly progress update on the remaining inquiry into the city of perth recommendations for the city two notes the proposed cancellation of the implementation of recommendations 210 of the inquiry into the city of perth as outlined in attachment 151a and the third bullet point which is new requests the ceo to progress the intent of recommendations 17 and 18 of the inquiry as outlined in attachment 151a with a view to implement a suitable cultural feedback assessment for the city 's council members ceo and city 's executive leadership team thank you councillor clayton um so we will now put the alternate motion uh second or first of course thank you councillor gordon um council of later sure i 'll just explain i 'm sure everyone 's got the piece of paper in front of them um i don 't think anyone should shy away from 360s being used for senior leaders ceo or council i think it 'd be a very effective development tool for us as a group but also further into the organization sometimes they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely not they 're a development tool they 're not the be all and end all there 'll be other tools that the ceo can use as well i think it would also help the lord mayor better engage with the group around this table and i don 't want us to forget the lessons of the inquiry i 'm hesitant in a year after the inquiry after all recommendations were adopted that we now say that the administration can handle the cultural feedback assessment loop internally without necessarily going external i think that 's not a good look at all and we should be setting up a process or a culture of feedback and openness long after we 're all gone we 're not just talking about the group here of every faith in the ceo and this management team but we 're looking into the future we 've spent eight million dollars on an inquiry and we have to make sure that we implement those effectively thank you thanks uh council of latin councillor gordon um councilman gordon is the uh second uh if you 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord may yes i agree wholeheartedly with what councillor fleeton has said and i think the elected members around the table as well as the public have ambitious goals for this city and if doing the 360 review can help us in achieving those then i think it 's a good outcome and a good investment of what i understand will be a small amount of resources so i 'm supportive thank you councillor gordon councillors you had your hand up are you speaking for or against here um i think i 've picked up a typo lord man so um in the alternate motion it refers to 17 and 18. however when i refer to the attachment it 's actually 18 and 19. the points we 're actually talking about okay we 'll just ask um brad to check that the movement and second are consenting to that change so the numbers are changing too 18 and 19. right i think it does anybody else wish to speak for or against the alternate motion okay well let 's put it to the vote then all those in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the we returned to the debate councillor bevan had we 're done with that that 's it happy days gee that 's good work thank you let 's go to 15 16 no reports 17 motions of which notice has been given 17-1 councillor sandy angie the tech plan a councillor angie has submitted a notice of motion regarding a tech plan councillor angie would you like to move your motion thanks lord mayor uh so my proposed motion is that the council requests the chief executive officer to one investigate ways to attract and support local interstate and overseas tech businesses to the city of perth two present a tech action plan for consideration at a future council meeting which outlines what support incentives and or other initiatives the city of perth can provide three if required list a provisional sum as part of a future budget for consideration by council at the 2021-22 mid-year financial review or at the time of setting the 2223 budget to allow for the cost of repairing the check action plan four as part of the tech action plan outline priority initiatives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of future budget for 2022 23 and beyond and 5 undertake appropriate consultation as required my reasons for this proposed motion is that tech is not only an important but a critical global sector with the largest companies in the world being tech companies as outlined in the deputation we 've just heard think of canva they started out here in perth and were actually discovered at the west tech festival but are now based in sydney according to recent media reports canva is now worth an astonishing 55 billion these kinds of companies are the ones that people and countries and cities all over the world want to attract because they bring employment opportunities other cities across australia have plans to attract tech as noted at our october 21 council meeting i outlined how city of sydney has a tech startup 's action plan which it published in 2016. sydney now has a global reputation for innovation and entrepreneurship and has the highest concentration of startups in australia the likes of atlassian afterpay canva judo bank and other high value innovators like tyro payments and airtasker all kickstarted operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan which it published in 2017 city of brisbane has a host of initiatives including residency for emerging startups at the business business brisbane business hub a joint initiative of brisbane city council and the brisbane economic development agency and a choose brisbane campaign for prop tech in our october 2021 council meeting the city of perth administration outlined how the city of perth has been supporting tech over the period from 2013 to 2021 these range of initiatives based on the information subsequently supplied to me by the city 's administration uh sums up that this the topic i 'm sorry i was going to um i was going to jump in at an appropriate point to get a second so let 's get that now given the debate is kind of in the process of opening up thanks councillor koh second councillor angie continue on thank you um the total support for these initiatives was 926 000 from 2013 to 2021 so that 's approximately fifteen thousand seven hundred fifty dollars each year for the eight years also based on the information provided to me by the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars worth of support to the sector in the current financial year today while this is a start and i acknowledge that and a broad range of programs have been supported i believe we can do more and better to position perth 's startup hub not only in sponsorships but in other initiatives and in particular while the city of perth currently supports some initiatives there is no coordinated plan like other australian cities we do need a plan we don 't have to reinvent the wheel there are many precedents and i provided links to those in in the agenda papers and the city of perth has so much to offer as we all know with many advantages over the eastern states for example as you know we 're perfectly positioned in the world 's most populous time zone with approximately 60 of the world 's population living with one hour of our time zone i recently met someone who had relocated to perth from copenhagen her tech company had plans to move to singapore but when covert hit they diverted to the safe shores of perth just this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had relocated to perth and he is part of a tech company that 's now moved here we need more of this we need people to know that perth is a tech hub and we need to support them when they get here we saw the city of perth spring into action to embrace opportunities this year including the afl grand final or to activate the lord mans distress fund let 's spring into action now to help position perth as a tech hub and an innovation hub and now is the time as our borders reopen to the rest of the country and the rest of the world in the new year at the lord mayor 's brand perth forum in july on the theme of city of lights one attendee talked about perth being the city of bright ideas let 's be the city of bright people and bright ideas a tech and innovation hub in closing i just wanted to note the administration 's response to my notice of motion and we have seen the draft economic development strategy prepared by erbis for the city a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not able to disclose its contents development of specific tech plan was not included in this strategy i 'm pleased to hear in the admins response that the tech sector will be consulted as part of this strategy but the strategy is not enough as in the precedence provided from sydney and melvin a specific action plan for a tech was followed on from the overall economic development strategy and that 's what i 'm asking for in this notice of motion that that plan the commitment to develop that plan is locked in further i reference the city strategic community plan again while this is currently under review the current plan talks about a can-do reputation that delivers investment and assists small businesses and development generally through a willingness to assist and encourage let 's assist the internet as stated in the city 's community plan has caused remarkable expanse expansion in digital technology and harnessing the virtual world has become important to all facets of society as we heard in the deputation people are lining up to help us with this plan we 've just all come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lgbtqia plus advisory committee plan which was the result of a notice of motion that i put up a year ago i 'm asking for the council support to support this notice of motion so that in a year or more 's time however long it takes we can again be on level 11 celebrating another great plan for the city and i did note sorry for being taking up everyone 's time that at the launch of the lgbtqi plus advisory plan just now the lord mayor said that this plan was ground breaking and world leading let 's create another groundbreaking world leading plan thank you thank you um councillor angie uh second it was councillor co is there anything you 'd like to add councillor ko i just wanted to mention i 've actually over the past couple of weeks i 've been attending a couple of tech events and i 've noticed one thing that a lot of tech startups actually want uh isn 't actually funding is actually exposure and as a city i think we can actually provide them a platform for exposure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councillor kai uh councillor gobert speaking perform uh i 'd love to move in amendment please let me know i 'm giving the effect under point three after the words counsel to delete the remainder of that sentence and under point four um after the words considered by counsel as part of delete a and leave the word future then delete the words budget 422 23 and beyond and after that put the words deliberations and have to happen again so that would give the effect of 0.3 to read if required list a provisional sum as part of a future budget for consideration by council full stop point four being as part of the tech action plan outline priority initiatives and required budgets to be considered by council as part of a few of future budget deliberations and points one two and five remaining the same yeah we have a second that please for the amend amendment amendment uh councillor angie thank you councillor thank you lord mayor i 'm just in um listening to the points that counselor angie made um i think that um it 's entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council angie has put to investigate ways to attract and support businesses to the city to present a plan as we have we have a plan for our lighting we have a plan for our electrical upgrades we have a plan for our curb replacements we have a plan for many things that we do as a local authority and when we look to the future of our city it 's it 's very clear that digital technology is only growing and growing i think it 's important as part of this process in the council meeting to acknowledge ideas send them away to the administration and then have them presented back to us at a later date i think that in speaking to the specifics of the motion deleting the last part of point three um i think that would just constrain us a little bit i think that we need to um we 've already had a bit of a first cut of what might be presented to the media review and i 'm just a little cautious that we might be um re-prioritizing at a late date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm just mindful of that specifically to point four i think it 's just again under the same mindset it 's if we acknowledge the idea as part of the motion it 's safer in my consideration that we just acknowledge the idea and put it to a future budget so i think i 'm quite happy to speak to the motion if it is amended at a later point but i think this just tidies it up a bit to say if we acknowledge the idea then we can have a discussion about what is included or what might be included at a later date thanks councillor gobert uh councillor angie is the seconder i 'm just thanking council government for his amendments yes thank you uh does anybody else wish to speak for or against councillor gordon i 'll speak against and probably seek to clarify the intention of the amendment um if the intention is to acknowledge the idea and consider it at a later date in line with the budget then current point two is not captured under that and it 's still requesting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any budget consideration so it doesn 't achieve that um when you brought a lord i 'm happy to raise a point of personal clarification i think that point three does indeed do that it says list a provisional sum as far as as part of a future budget consideration okay well the view is that you have clarified your point and um i think that does make sense counselor gordon are you satisfied by that explanation well the motion as it would be amended would be instructing the ceo to present the tech action plan so let me just check if that 's the view up here all right just sorry it 's a point of order it says well it says let 's let 's just can let 's just get uh let 's just get clarification on what 's before us first and then so i think the view up here council gordon is that it doesn 't specify which budget it just is at a future council meeting so i think on that basis i think if he 's allowed and stands as has been clarified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes we are okay yeah certainly ceo uh through the lord mayor i would just ask the question it 's just for a future council meeting for a future budget so that could be any point so from a city administration perspective to have some time frames otherwise this could be something we put off for five years so some clarity as to if this motion is passed is it within this financial year or next financial year that 's actually stated in the motion so you know we have to in the application for the motion you tick a box which says what year and i noted that um wa 's board is soon reopening and i believe it should be done as a matter of urgency however i understand the administration has competing priorities and have put a one-year time frame on it i think what counselor governor was just trying to clarify is that the motion was general i said the plan be presented at a future meeting any budget requirements we presented a future meeting the one two and three four listed wasn 't the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed so clearly if there 's budget required for the plan that would go ahead of any presentation at a future meeting so that is not the order of doing things in that thing oh ceo sorry i may have been confused i thought we were talking about the amended motion which actually took out then some of those dates so yeah so we took out the dates in three and four which would give clara if we accept the amendment would have given the clarity to the administration as far as deliverables is anybody else wishes to speak for or against councillor goberts can i ask you a question oh man i guess you could as the mover i 'm able to take out the amendment to motion four or point four of the motion um can i ask a question well firstly i 'll say that with the consent of the secondary you can uh now you have i was the second yeah i know that counselor angie no um are we happy to take a question now we have we 've got to deal with this first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice from the administration i 'm happy to take out um the amendment 2.4 and leave it as just point three being amended and thank the ceo and mr slants for their advice okay can i ask the question now yes for angie um i think i 'm not sure but it appears the intent of counsellor gobett 's amendment was to just give it flexibility to the administration so i guess my question is to the administration would you prefer to see dates in there or dates taken out i think that 's was the council goldberg 's intent is that to not put pressure on anyone in the administration and to leave it open to you as to the timing of when things are delivered uh ceo thank you through the lord bear and we very much appreciate the flexibility that is afforded however with a very uh heavy project load that we already have clarity around council expectations and delivery would be much appreciated so as much as we sincerely appreciate the flexibility clarity of delivery is probably a most important uh key performance indicator for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so councillor gobert is going to close now for the amendment thank you lovely and just to reiterate the points i 'm bringing the discussion together as it were noting council gordon 's points and the advice from the ceo and back and forth on that appreciate that as well i 'm quite happy as the mover with the support of the second r um for the amendment to just be points three um as amended and then leaving point four as presented by councillor angie um i again i appreciate that there is some direction that we need to give as the council um understanding that we have been presented with some um i guess first cut of the media review and i thought it would it would be a bit um onerous on the administration to set that as part of the media financial review uh but um overall i think that this if we were to as 0.4 um take that out and leave it as by council as part of a future budget for 22 23 and beyond um i think that addresses the motion without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to vote for the amendment all those in favor councillor co councillor angie councillor goblin deputy lord mayor bain council of beverly and those against councillor lisa lord mayor councillor gordon councillor fleeton so that has been carried as part of the so it now forms part of the main motion now we are back to who okay speakers for and against now the main motion we 've heard from councillor angie councillor we 've heard from council go we 've heard from councilman speaking for please yeah um speaking to the overall intent of the motion now um look as i said we 've got plans upon plans for everything that we do as a local government i think that it 's important that we acknowledge this as an idea and that we put it into our deliberations that we that we are going to shortly go into again for our budget planning um whether or not that that 's prepared for the long-term short-term i don 't know i think it 's just critical at this point that we at least refer that to the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future budget 22 23 and beyond is a starting point and i 'm interested to see what might come back as part of our program for that who knows what we might see we might see various grant proposals come out of that we could see co-working spaces we could see any number of ideas gen be generated out of this through community consultation and consultation within stakeholders in this industry i mean i 'm not a tech expert i take the advice of people who are experts in this field and much to what council angie spoke of before about the lgbtqia plus plan that we launched some minutes ago upstairs it 's there are things that are in that plan that i would have not been at all aware of unless we were presented with that so i think it 's important to just acknowledge the idea refer to the administration and be provided with that advice so with that i will ask for the support of my colleagues thank you thanks councillor government does anybody wish to speak against the motion council of fleeting i 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just want to make a few comments and i might make my own mind up during that if that 's all right um i heard a lot about brisbane and comparing us to other capital cities so brisbane has a population the city council in brisbane has a population of 1.2 million people we have 30 thousand brisbane 's budget the annual budget this year was 3.6 billion that they had to spend ours is 261 million so they 're 13 times the size everything counselor angie said i 100 agree with as to why we should do this my concerns are totally around the implementation and the outcome this is completely different to a social issue plan that we launched before i don 't understand the correlation between the two i moved a motion earlier this year actually it was when we first got elected in 2020 around the commonwealth government 's task force to attract global talent so i 'm completely on board with the reasons why i just worry that we 're sprinting while the organization is still catching up on the fundamentals in terms of strategies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sets us up for failure in terms of expectation management and outcomes so i love the idea it 's just we don 't just get to say things in this chamber and they automatically happen you have to implement it ceo and what you 're telling us is right now we 've got other things that we need to get right first so this is on its way i mean point one we 're already doing that point uh i don 't know which points have changed now i 've got difference here um i also think your amendments is not accurately reflected on screen anyway um but what i 'm saying is we 're already doing these things we 've got staff in the chamber who are working very very hard on these things um and we just need to get that top line strategy right which you 're already indicating but i 'll leave it there uh thanks councillor fleeton is there anybody who wishes to speak for the motion council obey thank you very much lord mayor as someone who 's been to israel on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days to palo alto where i saw startup deals happening live in front of my eyes to melbourne where sally cap the lord mayor boasted to me about how melbourne wants to steal sydney 's mantle as the tech capital of australia i 'm very supportive of this motion and in fact i would like a working group to be a part of this motion but we don 't seem to to uh do that at this council if we we as a city want to be a global economy which pay plays on a global stage we must act like a modern and progressive city and not just support but help to cultivate a growing and emerging tech community we need practical measures which include being alluring to the lucrative venture capital market providing a landing pad for new businesses helping startups to be linked and networked with industry so they can commercialize intellectual property providing cost-effective spaces for brilliant ideas to flourish imagine if we had all those pieces of the puzzle about 10 years ago when as councillor angie said melanie perkins was forced to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasn 't mature enough we 're about to open up in this state and now is the time to start thinking about how we can use our international connections and align with the state government 's diversification agenda to help startups go global we 're in the midst of an innovation boom in this world where new businesses can spring up and become global players in a very very short time we should take out take a leaf out of that that book when it comes to that kind of agility while the city is developing a broader economic development plan working on this in parallel will signal to our administration the ceo and our significant rate payers like jeffrey leach who is in the room today that we are uh we are this this plan and tech is a strategic priority for our city and it shouldn 't just be left on the shelf and we shouldn 't just rely on others to within the administration to kind of pull something together that we as a group may or may not or individually support so that 's why i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord mayor is there anybody who wishes to speak against the motion uh councillor gordon thank you lord mayor i 'm just a bit confused all round i guess i 'd be confused as to why we bother with an economic development strategy if we 're going to cast it aside and jump ahead and do our own thing anyway let 's let 's line our ducks in a row and make things fall out of one another let 's get the strategy in place then implement the action plans um i 'm also confused about the achievement of the of the amendment my understanding was that we were going to consider this in line with the future budget but actually all we 've done is eliminate half the wording from three which i think we should have maintained to allow for the cost of preparing the tech action plan so now the cost of the action plan isn 't contemplated at all in the amended motion um so we go ahead and we budget only for the initiatives that are identified in the action plan so if we support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full steam ahead with something that we haven 't strategically identified and endorsed and consulted at this stage so it 's very confusing thank you councillor gordon um councillor bevan you should speak for the motion yes i do thank you many years ago when i joined the bank i thought the calculators were sensational things have changed a lot since then and we don 't have a tech action plan we need one we have to have one we 've talked about activation in the city council talking is fine it 's a doing that produces results i think it 's time to start doing things we talk about can do and how long do we wait before we can do i think it 's time when we have the enthusiasm and that 's what we need we need enthusiasm to get these things done in council in fact tom hafey once said if you want to be an effective leader you have to be the most enthusiastic person in the room and i think that we have a couple of them here tonight and i 'm very pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councillor diebane deputy lord mayor and i think it 's the enthusiasm that we show tonight that 's going to produce results for the city of perth and for this tech action plan that we desperately need thank you councillor bevin is there anybody who wishes to speak against the motion for the motion um i 've just got uh a couple of questions i think for the administration so my understanding maybe i 've got this wrong my understanding is that we are using the strategy to inform our plan can i ask is that right person correct okay and that strategy um that strategy work has begun and is being undertaken now is that correct correct okay and when and i did ask our guest um if he were able as part of the public consultation process to inform that strategy or to speak to that strategy in early next year whether he would be happy with that outcome he said yes he would be he 'd be delighted or something to that effect is that going to happen yes consultation on a draft strategy is due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so i think what we 're wondering here is so off the back of that how quickly would we have the plan we can see i think everybody in this room is uh supportive of what councilor angie has put up and uh despite the confusion um supportive of councillor gobert 's enthusiasm for it as well and the deputy lord mayors i guess the question is how quickly will we have the plan if we follow the process that we have before us well once council approved the strategy then the opportunity to really we should be working in parallel with the plan anyway so it may well be that once we have the feedback that will almost im immediately then inform a planning document or plans uh it depends because each of the themes may well have their own separate plans so you would have a digital plan you might have a so the plans will link back to the major strategy um is that june next year is that this time next year is it when is that so the actual depends on the consultation and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to council in march next year if council approve the strategy then we would have something that would inform the budget process in 2223 okay right so i think i think in many ways we 're sort of um we 're arguing for the same thing um if that time frame is accurate then that 's that 's what we 're talking about i would have thought um but i guess the best way to find out is to put it to a vote but councillor angie you have the opportunity a yes question so just following on the next question in that logical sequence was that strategy that we went through and drafted had the short term medium term long term actions correct in the coming three months will we have a work plan on what the team is going to be able to achieve in the zero to two year market if this is passed i think no so that 's why in part the strategy and the opportunity to consult with key stakeholders on where those priorities might be for the short the medium and long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this effort immediately and so it really could be a little confusing particularly externally if you know after consultation we 're advised that there 's a different priority which is highly unlikely however you don 't know and so the process of having a strategy that then the plans fall out of is how um usually such things occur um but again coming back to my point i think informing the 22 23 budget could be the strategy and the supporting plans okay council has one more question um does the passage of this motion tonight make things happen faster um i think if we work to inclusion in the 2223 budget it could be that this just preempts some of the work coming out of the strategy so it 's it 's hard to predict but we would need to start work on it now because really those considerations and projects uh for the 22-23 budget really are in the mix right now we 've already had a preliminary budget meeting we 'll be having another one in early december so we are starting to talk about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as clear is um without a strategy to inform the projects we 're doing it a little bit back to front okay i ask these questions because i think from what i 'm seeing around the room i think everybody 's in furious agreement that this is a space that we want to charge into but i i guess we want to charge into it um fully strategized but uh councillor angie it 's your opportunity now to close the debate thanks lord mayor i guess i 'll just go through and address um a reply to some of the comments made by lord mayor and others um in relation to the lord mayor i 've got the draft economic development strategy right here that we 've received and drafts obviously can 't disclose but there was no um indication in that strategy that this kind of plan would fall out of that or was the intention intention that that would be and next step this makes clear that as a council we are committed to a tech startup plan as part of the development strategy and i thank uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of working in parallel that we know this to me two years and you know the phrase this is a no-brainer this has been done across the country and all over the world to have a tech action plan is a no-brainer we don 't need consultation to tell us this i mean and i 'm sure that will be the outcome of the consultation anyway so like i said it 's not wasn 't contemplated in the current strategy prepared by herbis with the city this makes clear that it is um as councillor bevin said i 'm in agreement with what he said we do need a plan and we need to start doing things and people want to see action and development of an action plan sends a signal to the market and to you know in the country and across the world that we are open for business here in perth and that we want tech businesses here in perth that we want to be a hub in relation to councillor gordon 's comments about being confused i 'll have to say i can always rely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i put forth as amendment or notice of motion whether it 's a statue of a woman a youth advisory group investigating securing a pocket of west perth and that was just in one meeting so i won 't comment further on councillor gordon 's comments other than just to note that while councillor gordon may see her view as a counselor as more limited in my view good governance is more than that good governance follows rule of law it 's transparent it 's accountable it 's effective and efficient but it 's also responsive it 's responsive to our community to our city and to our ratepayers so in relation to councillor felicians comments about the potential cost and the lack of budget that the city of perth has the initiative the idea that i put forward for a plan contemplates entirely our city 's budget and as we 've seen in the sydney 's plan which i put a link in the notice of motion too it can be simple things it can be an awareness campaign which one of the councils raid notion creating an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tech startup ecosystem it can be using our communication channels to showcase tech startups to show this to the country in the world it can be just through grants and sponsorships supporting tech events which we 're currently doing and it may be that some of the plan actually just packages up some of the things we 're already doing but as i said it 's a cohesive plan that sends a signal sure there may be other initiatives as cons contemplated by council afflation that may be more costly but of course that will all be within the city 's budget and of a scale that 's suitable to our city using the examples provided um i thank councillor um co and gobert and govet and um and bevan for their support sorry flicking through my notes i think i 've covered everything other than just to note that a plan is quite different to a strategy and what we need is concrete action so with that i think i 've spoken for probably long enough i hope that council supports this motion thanks councillor andrew we can now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary motion all those in favor and they are counsellor coe councillor angie councillor gobert councillor bain and councillor bevan those against councillor lisa lord mayor councillor gordon and councillor flinton we can declare the motion the amended motion carried five to four well done councillor angie we

point should we uh have the live stream closed given that uh no so should we yeah uh there 's not there so no further questions there no okay let 's go then over to 18 one perth concert hall reserve transfer transfer request no no um this is still the proximity interest here so are there any questions on this item from any councillors and if there are if there are we will then close the meeting at this point potential one there seems to be a mismatch of 18.1 is sometimes referred to as east perth portal and sometimes with the reserve transfer request right i 've got it as reserve transfer request here well maybe it 's just the bookmark i think it 's just the bookmark okay so are there any questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and see if there 's a question here 18-2 perth concert hall cash backed reserve request to release the funds we know the council loses uh outside the chamber the proximity interest has been declared are there any questions from any councillors on this item no

a moment to reflect and actually a moment of reflection is appropriate as we begin this morning many of us will have heard the sad news that russell wolff respected broadcaster with the abc died during his sleep in the early hours of this morning russell was the abc breakfast host he was enormously interested and invested in the goings-on and affairs of the city of perth he was of course also for a period tv weatherman with abc tv the abc itself a long time home in the city of perth firstly on adelaide terrace as we all know and now more recently in east perth i know that deputy lord mayor diebane worked with russell for a good period of time at the abc and russell and i began our careers together on community radio and we would appear on each other 's programs russell was a good bloke he was a good fellow he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style all of his own and he was an amazing part of the abc here in perth and as we pay our respects to him and the great legacy that he leaves we remember his family and acknowledge them and we might just take a moment 's reflection for russell thank you everybody and i know that uh our friends at the abc will appreciate that greatly on russell 's behalf and obviously russell 's family we wish them all the very best in their time of grief i 'd like to move to uh happier news obviously and that is the election of our new council it gives me great pleasure to congratulate and welcome our new councillors which of course in effect is welcoming back our four councillors who were up for election that is councillors fleeton councillors bevan councillor gobert and councillor coe a great endorsement for the work of our group in the first 12 months and to have four out of four of our incumbents returned i think speaks volumes for the work that has been done and is being done in our community and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work is being done as i did at our special council meeting last week i also want to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank all of those candidates who put their hand up to run for the four council positions that were vacant it takes not only courage but in particular a dedication and a commitment to the city and to our fellow rate payers and to all of those people one i think i notice is that raj raj one of whom is here tonight raj congratulations to you and our fellow council candidates who were not successful as i said it makes us all better having an invested group who want to be a part of the city of perth and represent the ratepayers and i thank all of those people who put their hands up and i particularly congratulate councillors fleet and bevin gobert and co there is much work still to do we know that but the job has begun it 's begun in good style and it 's wonderful to get at least the next two years together as a group to keep working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document will go out from the city of perth which outlines some of our achievements over the 12 months there are numerous to mention and i won 't take this opportunity to mention them now but i think more importantly even than what has been achieved and as i said that communication will come out at the end of this week as we mark 12 months in office but more so it 's the way that it has been achieved we have worked together professionally transparently cohesively and respectfully really importantly respectfully we 've got lots done and we 've got it done in the manner that which would be expected of a capital city council but most importantly that we expect of ourselves and i 'd like to thank our fellow councillors for working in that manner i 'd also like to take this opportunity again to thank councillor angie for her tireless work in our first 12 months and her period of 12 months in office as deputy lord mayor it was an outstanding contribution and sandy i 'd like to thank you personally for the great assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champion for our city in that 12 months i know that work will continue and i know our rate payers know that that work will continue but thank you greatly from all of us for your significant contribution to our first 12 months together can i also take this opportunity again to congratulate our new deputy lord mayor die bain dies you know and i 've had the opportunity to express several times i 'm very much looking forward to working with dai and that 's a partnership that has already begun we 've intended ratepayer meetings a stakeholder lunch and a freedom of entry celebration in just the last few days it 's down to work and down to work immediately and i am very much looking forward to working side by side in partnership with councillor and now deputy lord mayor bain i mentioned the transparency in my announcement there at the start and of that transparency and what we heard at the special counsel meeting last tuesday was the desire from a majority of council to rotate the deputy lord mayor 's position every 12 months and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will step down in october of next year or at the appropriate point towards october of next year to allow another councillor the opportunity to step up you can 't get more team oriented than that deputy lord mayor bain congratulations we look forward to working closely together over the next 12 months and again i congratulate you and thank you safety in our city and in our community remains this council 's number one priority on most days you 've heard me say this before our city remains the friendly and welcoming environment that we all expect it to be but as we know particularly our councillors who have been out in election mode speaking to ratepayers frequently every day as we all know on the bad days at the wrong time in the wrong place people do not always feel safe and this is not a situation that any of the city of perth councillors are satisfied with for that reason earlier this month i wrote to local government minister john kerry and wrote separately to the premier to inform him of my correspondence with the minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city 's proposal to reinvest the balance owing of 4.2 million dollars for the city of perth inquiry and that they support that balance owing being reimbursed towards critical safety initiatives in our city essentially we 're asking the state government to allow us to spend city of perth ratepayers money on the safety of city of perth ratepayers business owners and operators residents and visitors third in the letter to correspondence dated 30 november 2020 from the former minister for local government david templeman which stated that the state government was and i quote open to working with the city to identify and negotiate that a portion of funds recouped may be invested on shared priority initiatives there is no more pressing shared priority initiative than safety in our city and with the support of the state government the 4.2 million dollars would be meaningfully used by the city to fund the following an increase in safe city security patrol officers to improve visibility and community access to safety services in high priority areas in the order of 1.6 million dollars the installation of additional cctv cameras in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and east perth to the tune of around 1.3 million dollars the delivery of youth intervention programs and preventative measures for people affected by drugs and alcohol in the order of around five hundred thousand dollars an increase in assertive cultural outreach services again in the order of around 500 000 and the implementation of recommendations from the recent crowded places security audit to reduce the risk of terrorism and other hostile events to the tune of around 1.4 million dollars i am i 've got to say most hopeful of a positive outcome as we all know no premier has made a higher priority of the safety of his or her citizens than our premier premier mark mcgowan and clearly the local government minister as the member for perth is well aware of the safety issues we need help addressing again safety is this council 's number one priority and the one that 4.2 million dollars of rate payers money reimbursed would go a long way to helping us address and i look forward to hearing back from that correspondence in the very near future at that point announcements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item 5.1 public questions no public questions have been received in advance we have just received one recently so this is from the floor okay so could i call on chris wally 's chris here chris hi if you 'd like to step forward i 'll remind you that uh uh we need your name your address which we have here but i 'd like you to stay there my name is chris walliam from bandra and we need you to keep it to 10 minutes as a maximum thank you okay i 've been in this um thanks i 've been i 've been spending christmas new year period in perth for about say 25 30 years now and during that time i 've always gone to the um the nativity plays which have taken place in forest chase along with the iga carols by canton lake concerts at jubilee gardens but during the last three years unfortunately those events have not happened the first time was largely because of lousy weather it was just too wet to have any open air concerts but the year before last plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as a result there 's been no open air concerts of any description whatsoever anywhere but i 'm actually my question to uh council is this does the city council have any plans at all to resurrect the negativity play uh concerts or happening in forest chase this year and the week before christmas eve plus the iga carols by candlelight concerts at either jubilee gardens or langley park langley park was the last place they had them simply because it 's a bigger venue where more people could gather thank you chris thank you um i 'll in part answer that question one of our achievements which will go out in our circular on friday was the resurrection of the nativity production last year and the nativity production is again part of part of our christmas offering this year i 'll invite the ceo to refer to the relevant general manager but can i also add to that that our christmas lights trail in my opinion is the best community event that is offered in this state it is absolutely breathtaking and to see the number of families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together it goes a long way to addressing some of the anti-social issues that i mentioned earlier but also it is a time to be in the city of perth and it was breathtaking and spectacular to see so many families making the most of our christmas lights trail that 's personally from me but ceo if i could refer to you please thank you much thank you lord mayor mr wally yes the iga carols by candlelight event was delivered by a third party which at the time was variety wa and the city is not aware of any plan to deliver the event in 2021 however we are pleased that we do have the nativity um have happening in forest place over the christmas period so thank you for the question okay thanks chris thanks for being here tonight we appreciate it very much thank you are there any further questions uh from the floor okay thank you we 'll move to item 5.2 deputation ceo do we have any deputations tonight uh yes lord mayor we have received two deputations one in relation to item 12.2 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded there is a time limit for deputations i think you 're all well aware of what that time limit is and i will remind you if we 're getting close i 'll invite the first deputation to come forward that is mr rowan mcdougall representing curtin university and miss paula taylor representing 32 degrees south group to please step forward to make your deputation for item 12.2 i can ask you also please whoever is speaking or if both of you are speaking to give us your address thank you thank you and thank you for the opportunity to provide the deputation to you here this evening i 'll also acknowledge that we 're meeting on what land and pay respect to their elders past present and emerging as i don 't have to convince you that perth is a vibrant and connected and progressive city and we 're all we all love living here we 've had a dream run with covert and also with the resources sector however times are changing and i think we all realize we need to look to future industries if we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a great partnership with the city of perth over many years in building an event that attracts tech investors and entrepreneurs from across the country and the globe representatives from apple google twitter qualcomm microsoft facebook zenga snapchat you name it have been here to perth and they 've loved their experience in this city they 've been involved in west tech events that have run in previous years and they 've provided insight for the citizens of perth into the global tech sector curtin 's supported this event uh since inception has been invested over a million dollars into building the program and are committed to its future future it 's a highly inclusive and collaborative event that brings together the perth tech community and this is towards a common goal of diversifying the economy here in perth and in western australia i think we can say that west tech fest is generally accepted as the premier tech community event in wa however we 've struggled to break into a broader public awareness and this is really where we need the help of the city of perth with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future of the city and the state now there 's no better example of what 's possible with an event like west tech fest and the tech sector than the canvas story which i 'm sure some of you are familiar with many of you know that this digital design company started here in perth what you might not know is that they pitched at a very early incarnation of west tech fest and it was through the connections that were made at west tech fest that they met bill thai who was one of our co-founders of the event who provided the founders with access to early capital and the expertise to build a globally competitive product and company recently you may have seen that canva raised 200 million dollars at a 40 billion evaluation now just think about that for a minute that is a valuation that 's more than west farmers billions more than fortescue and almost twice the valuation of woodside this demonstrates the enormous value that investors place on future potential and we need to position perth to capture some of that potential now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place for them and they relocated to sydney but west tech is aimed at building the ingredients and the culture that encourages tech companies to start and stay here in perth to scale we can build another canva and there are many startups that are being supported through the west techfest network right now that could follow a similar path companies like health engine space draft power ledger and vet chip are all companies that have potential to build into these unicorn type companies and employ the numbers of people similar to the 2000 plus people being employed by canva today to build a successful tech company you need entrepreneurial spirit you need spart investment capital access to skilled people and access to customers software platforms like the app store now provide access to global markets almost immediately even the city of perth has discovered that with streaming technology you 're able to reach a global audience relatively quickly and covert has certainly taught us that we can connect with our peers nationally and internationally from here in perth while enjoying the beautiful environment that we do here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tech sector jobs i think we can say that wa bounds with entrepreneurial spirit and also the smart capital in the resources sector but we need to diversify this interest into the tech sector if we 're going to embrace the future west tech is about raising the profile of the tech sector inspiring the next generation of entrepreneurs and building the capacity to support the start and growth of next generation businesses right here we want perth to continue to be recognized as the vibrant connected and progressive city of the future that it is today so thank you for your time and we 'd be very happy paula taylor and i as a co-founder to answer any questions you have about the events uh thank you for your attention thank you ron well done and well delivered and paula thank you for being here also um do uh any counsellors have any questions that counselor angie thank you lord mayor um first question is just will the free events across the sea proceed without the additional funding requested from the city and what is the general implications of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason to approach the city for increased funding is we believe the time is now to really scale the interest in this event coming out of the pandemic as a great opportunity for us to embrace some of these future industries and business opportunities right now if we can get the profile for this event out to a broader audience attract the attention of investors nationally and globally and continue the relationships that we 've been able to do we see there 's great potential to build and diversify the economy here and we really need to start now uh if we 're able to if we don 't get the funding to scale obviously we will continue with the event but at a smaller level just to add on to that thank you for your question we are doing a big push this year for one for diversity and inclusion and we are launching west tech women and we 'll be running that as a free event at the woodside auditorium that is event we 're 100 committed to and we 'll go ahead with that there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have up to um 17 between 17 and 20 events in the city in planning some confirmed already and we will have to definitely scale back because just of resources also we have a marketing plan ready to launch on the 3rd of november we 've hired a marketing manager digital extensive digital strategy and our aim is actually as warren said to reach a broader audience that will need to be scaled back as well just because of funding so there will be some um cutback in the program but some will definitely go ahead as planned uh yes the um counselor angie thanks lord mayor um one more question what 's the total cost of the event and how much was what percentage was the original request so in terms of the budget it was more than i think it 's 38 is that correct in terms of the grant for the city of perth in terms of the budget we manage it 's in excess of 200 000 but what we didn 't include in the grant was the impact and expenditure of the third party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that so i can 't give you an exact answer but we have 10 partner events in the city so all you know coming together we have created a festival in the city of perth and that 's where we 're at now um in terms of the budget for what we 're our expenditure it 's yeah i think over 200 yeah i 've got a question yeah but councillor gordon 's got a question also and had a handout very quickly and i like that thank you look there um just a question regarding how you will be expanding your reach this year in light of um lack of travel into the state i can answer that okay there 's a number of initiatives we 're launching um investor office hours we have 15 vcs locked in including local perth feces but also on the east coast representing the major funds blackbird air tree one ventures so they will be doing one and a half hour sessions with local founders we 'll be running some live at the main west tech fest conference at beaumont and their point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way we 're also streaming in international and national speakers as well as local will have a hybrid event and for the first time ever we 're launching this year it 's called the west tech fest investor network and it 's 10 angel investors local investors coming together pooling a hundred thousand dollars to support angel funding for local startups that 's good thank you just a question then regarding the estimated estimated attendance sorry of 3300 is that people in attendance in person or that 's the whole um because up to 20 events it 's easy we can comfortably reach that number the main event is 350 on average most events are 200 250. councillor kai thanks for coming to speak to us i 'm just curious where do you get a lot of your money from you say you budget 200 000 and you 're asking us but where does the money come from uh every year we go and uh approach sponsors for support of the event over the years we 've had sponsorship from a variety of different groups this year we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ australian government have supported the state government have supported to a certain level uh there 's a number of corporates that also are supported at a at a modest level so we we try and operate the event through sponsorship every year and so on that is there any government state government funding yes there is the state government so through jetsey are providing twenty thousand dollars twenty twenty thousand dollars yep twenty yes and also i might add federal government ten thousand in yeah um yes we must say we 've struggled to uh to get the level of sponsorship that we believe the event warrants from the state government it 's been great to have their support but if we look at um similar events say in in the state of south australia queensland they 're supported by the state government up to a level of around half a million dollars wow and absolutely without the city of perth support the event wouldn 't be where it is now because the city of perth has been a really much valued supporter for many years when the event was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear just one final question from me there may be others last year there was fifty thousand dollars cash support from the city of perth do you recall what amount you uh asked for last year it was a three-year 50 000 for three years in a row which is what we asked for right yeah okay okay thank you are there any further questions uh well can i thank you both rowan and paula for your excellent deputation thank you very much thanks for being here and thanks for uh the great event that you were put on in our city uh can i just remind councillors which i didn 't then but if any councillors have any questions of the admin in relation to any of these deputations please reserve them until this item is open for debate i 'll now invite deputation number two mr david gonzalez and mr paul alain hunt who are representing the lgbtqi plus advisory group to please step forward to make your deputation for item 12.3 paul if you would be so good 10 minutes as you know also your address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perth paul elaine hunt i 'd like to quickly start by acknowledging uh intersex awareness day and also how excited i am to be going to this event uh that was mentioned in the deputation just before me um at the core of our society and our ideals as perth residents and australians more broadly is not just democracy but values values such as respect tolerance compassion equality opportunity and the right to a fair go for all no matter your creed colour sexuality or gender today marks my 30th birthday it also marks almost to the day the first time i told someone that i was gay some 15 years ago growing up in perth these promises respect tolerance compassion equality came true for me for the most part i was lucky enough to reconcile my challenges and to grow and i still stand here before you today i was all but just a child when i came out it was thanks largely in to the support of a at then city of perth based youth centre that made that happen the freedom centre a community centre and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young people lgbti young people today face many of the challenges that i did age 15. it 's now been more than a decade and a half since we can all understand why this is a challenge after all our community is dealing with consequences of generations of prejudice ignorance and even hatred but it does not have to be this way we can strive for better we must strive for better for our children for our friends for our families this is not simply the city of perth 's responsibility of course but our state our nation and indeed our leaders and those with a far bigger voice than mine the path that our communities youth face is steep it is mountainous but together we are making progress this progress comes from our community but also our supporters and leaders outside the rainbow the city of perth council and management now have an opportunity to save lives to change lives to strive for a brighter equitable and a truly just future we have this opportunity tonight by voting to pass this comprehensive document before us a plan that promises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a process that will become a beacon for other cities and states across australia and dara even say it internationally the process of engagement with community is a construct in a constructive and empowering way and then delivering on it is a model that we should be very proud of the document before you and the process it was built on is proof that the city of perth has the capacity to listen to its constituents businesses residents and reflects the diversity of this great capital city a document which acknowledges the past and moves forward with respect genuineness and the air of leadership it deserves true leadership is engaging it listens and creates change from the bottom up and it 's one where i 've been delighted to see the lord mayor give the ample space for this genuine approach to take root i not only admire that but it is quality that should be replicated across the political divide at all other tiers of government if we as a community can build on these processes in order to build the kind of grassroots solutions the city of perth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change not just for the lgbtiq a plus community but provide hope for many others who could be activated to also partner with the city to reach outcomes that would benefit this entire state it was unique that the lgbti qa plus advisory group was only established last year and within the space and time we found ourselves in we were given the right amount of oxygen to flourish we have listened to the community through gatherings workshops public submissions many of these were our own efforts rewarded with 50 or so people turning up versus the single digits which were part of the earlier process we have worked day and night sometimes into the early mornings as true community volunteers to produce this document and this plan for our community and for the city of perth we have a com we have accomplished something that many even within our own community were skeptical and thought to be unachievable especially given the time frame but we have and we have done it together in partnership the city of perth the community the city of perth council the lord mayor basil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandy angie councillors brent fleeton catherine lisa rebecca gordon clyde bevan liam gobbett and of course victor co this is your plan as much as it is ours we are ready to launch this plan and we firmly believe that the lord mayor should be uh the one to bring the community together for this when we launched this it would be a momentous occasion if the lord mayor would join us for the physical event if that 's what we have the launch is in about five weeks so we 'll have to act fairly quickly to make that happen but uh as shown by uh the capability of this council um it can be fairly agile especially with things like the grand final um you can do anything when you put your minds to it now i 'm aware of the time sorry uh but it is important to look back at what this process has yielded almost a year on uh what are some of the lessons that we have learnt from this exercise to date first off that when a community comes together acts together thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been rainbows and sunshine though i like to think some of my ties certainly provided some color in the meetings i won 't lie administration and bureaucracy has at times been challenging this was a new group for the city of perth it was a new group for the city of perth council it was a new process and a new vision of engaging with the community and of course you can expect some resistance because change after all can be difficult it goes a little bit beyond that it goes to the basic details of accountability um we have requested to obtain a budget expenditure report but that is still to be provided i was only recently made aware that the budget had been spent and not then rolled over um from a mere accountability standpoint we we do request the budget and expenditure report is provided to the group on perhaps quarterly basis um and maybe if we can see what it was where the money actually went um over the last financial year that would be good too likewise meetings themselves we have always insisted that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meeting as per our terms of reference we have found that our role in actively contributing to this draft has been pushed back on at times yeah without our insistence we did find that agendas were not being provided until we 've walked into the actual meeting at times and walking in blind to a meeting is disempowering it came to a head this week with some general communication issues so we found out that the city of perth administration had decided to amend the terms of reference without the advisory group 's knowledge so that is a motion that is here tonight i don 't think it 's realistic for um council to pay to pass a half-baked motion that provides a open check without um council oversight recommendations two so that 's just underneath the plan nine minutes paul nine minutes uh hands over control to the advisory of of the advisory group uh from the community to um the administration so from an accountability standpoint we um we don 't want to see that happen um i 'm going to move on from that now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the secondary recommendation proposed by staff which is listed under 12.3 as stated in the terms of reference any changes to the terms of reference or management of this advisory group need to be jointly agreed to and developed by the chairs with the city of perth administration before going to council that hasn 't been uh done now i won 't leave this on a sour note um so i 'll reiterate the incredible opportunity before us the true path to true equality for the lgbtiq a plus community is a long and sometimes arduous one it often happens inch by inch fight by fight and there is no sprint in this journey but sometimes on nights like this we take a significant step a leap on the path this is thanks to the persistent and passionate work of your advisory group um tonight we present this plan which is ultimately a game changer for the council and the local administration beneath it it reaffirms the city 's place as a leader within its tiers of government and perhaps a leader at a state and federal level too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as we have said previously it 's not a 10 minutes each situation it 's the one uh it is the one deputation but i think given the importance um prepare to give you a couple of minutes if you 'd like to take two minutes to uh sorry with respect that was not clarified by governance and we were given 10 minutes each so i do have a 10 minute speech there so sorry when when was that that was on friday and again on monday and again this morning at 7 00 uh at 8 30. let me just check with governance if you 're like i 've got mike weaver 's email on the on my phone unfortunately i have governor sitting right next to me so i don 't have to go far just a moment if you don 't mind with respect we would have changed our deputation to be able to include all the information required if we had known that there was a limit on our deputations lord mayor i 'm happy to move a motion to allow a ten minute deputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak all those in favor so away you go thank you thank you in july earlier this year i was proud to start my deputation with a quote from harvey milk that hope will never be silent and thus i look back with a full yet heavy heart at all we have achieved and know that in order to keep hope we now must speak out we started this year with a firm commitment from the lord mayor and council to address inequality and prejudice with an approach that would see the community empowered to enter a true partnership with the city we thank the lord mayor and indeed all councillors for their respect and even arms length restraint it 's been somewhat helpful to have enough space and oxygen to allow us to deliver a plan that is meaningful powerful and indeed consequential earlier this year i spoke how it was never an accident that forming an advisory group with 15 people from such diverse backgrounds would produce such a strong response i went further and said that it 's a response that no one should be scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the result of being part of a passionate community one with many hopes and dreams and i reminded council and its administration that at the end of the day these are ones of diversity ones of inclusion and ultimately one of equality things that no one should recoil from values that we can all embrace and indeed use it as a model for authentic community partnerships that truly deliver lasting benefits for for people across our city 12 months on this document shows that this city its councillors and its community have stepped up to the mark and worked together in partnership and the result is a commitment to not just words but rather to taking meaningful and consequential action none of this would have been possible without your leadership none of this would have been possible without you allowing a transparent and community driven process and indeed none of this would have been possible without the good will and faith that follows it 's one we where we hope to land with something to aspire to a process and a model of community chairing that we literally fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so easily replicated to provide not just hope but to activate many different subsets of our city where we struggle to come up with solutions that have real buy-in and take-up this lack of buy-in is because we often disempower our own stakeholders at the thought that it needs to be a controlled process a checkbox exercise or simply one that is risk adverse however this is not the kind of hope we dreamt of when we glimpsed the agenda a few days ago and thus this is not the deputation i originally envisaged to give to you today what we see in the agenda is a blatant poison pill tactically timed in the form of a second recommendation that attempts to shift power and oversight away from council and allows for staff to radically restructure the advisory group without genuine collaboration with with zero meaningful consultation and absolutely no collaboration or co-development counselors what you have before you is evidence of evasive tactics gross misrepresentation and worst of all a regurgitation of all the good will that we brought to the table pathetic and a miserable attempt to shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to ensure that the advisory group has a two-way dialogue in partnership with the with the city this has faced many roadblocks and pushbacks from staff who refuse to empathize with that approach or are simply outright resistive i don 't know whether this is due to a lack of leadership or whether this is instead learnt from leadership i suspect the response will reveal the distinction no one wants to air their dirty laundry but it 's with much sadness that instead of extolling the benefits of the plan we are instead defending the processes the processes that have produced such historic work so unique and so universally acclaimed that we strongly believe that this model should survive into the future it 's not our intention to call people out we have zero interest in doing so it is a complete distraction to our aims of achieving community outcomes but being backed into a corner we must call out process failures to ensure that future pathways retain integrity authenticity and legitimacy paul and i have committed ourselves to take the many lessons learnt from the past nine months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail the many process failures with the hope that the city administration will respond in a fair and proactive way that can be done internally and with us rather than excluding us we have long advocated for the need for community sharing especially in the lgbtiq space where autonomy and self-empowerment are values that we have built and defended for decades while we have always had staff facilitate meetings the chair the chairing has always been done on the basis that there should be independent community chairs what is being proposed is that staff now control all three main roles that of chairing facilitating and the secretariat this is dangerous it is damaging and it drowns out any genuine community involvement let alone the ability for partnership i can proudly say that every recommendation all 34 recommendations came out of strong genuine community consultation with repeated development and refinement all based around consensus around the advisory group table there was however the curious case of a singular earlier recommendation that did not work its way up from the community and impaired appeared inserted by staff this recommendation was for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the staff member advocating for it and in the end the ceo called that out and left us as an advisory group to concentrate on priorities that rightfully came from the community but throughout it 's only been because our group has pushed for timelines pushed for milestones and areas of responsibility that we saw the document form into an actual project plan rather than a document that would have been merely inspirational counsellors i cannot describe the work that would have been produced had we not railed against the early attempts to force 15 highly skilled lgbtiq people to fill in postcards with coloured textures in order to share their feelings instead we pushed for a standard that saw consensus-based decision-making in play this allowed for conversations that built concepts and built concepts into hard-hitting recommendations ones that you have that you have before you today we want to ensure that this empowered model of community engagement works it 's worked so well to produce a powerful and meaningful plan despite the toll and i 'm committed to ensure the road we 've tread is one paved with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want our plan to be the basis of actions and outcomes that meaningfully change lives and make our city a better place for all lord mayor in pride month before the end of this year we hope that we can come together to land a public launch to give it meaning and to commemorate the remarkable journey that this council and yourself have set into motion throughout this process we told ourselves that we had nothing to lose nine minutes david today i realized the only thing that was all on steak all along was our integrity it 's a value i think that harvey milk would be proud that by retaining hope and speaking out against silence that we have indeed perhaps held on like so many others to our integrity from those that have come before us and whose shoulders we stand on thank you david thank you appreciate that and thank you councillor fleeting councillor co for moving that motion to give you the opportunity to speak i 've got to say some of the language there directed towards our administration was quite strong and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our very hard-working administration and i feel compelled as the lord mayor to say that and put that on the record i have the great privilege to work with many staff here in our administration they are hard workers they 're people of integrity and i think it 's a cautionary note to everybody who gives a deputation here in our chamber that they show our administration and our staff as you would do each other and fellow councillors the respect that this chamber would deserve and indeed command notwithstanding thank you for making your passionate deputation we do appreciate it it 's important that all councillors had the opportunity to reflect i did also want to say i wanted to thank david and paul allen for co-chairing this very important advisory group it has been important work and it has taken us all on a significant journey and a journey that is moving not towards a conclusion but towards the end of its first stage and that 's how i see it i 'm sure that 's how many of our councillors see it this is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very first chapter and i well know how this journey began and we 're very mindful of it so with that i 'd also like to wish paul elaine a very happy 30th birthday and um who would have thought that you would have been celebrating here at the city of perth but that 's pretty special in its own way i 'll net and drive back from bangkok today okay i 'll now invite councillors if anybody has any questions thank you thanks lord man thanks for the deputations um certainly learned a lot over the last year i know you 're concentrating on the recommendation in front of us point two let 's for a moment take that away you 've talked a lot about the process over the year you 've mentioned three positions city officers said that they were going to take them can you just go into that some more it 's the first i 've heard of it and i don 't think i 've read it in there around these positions sorry could you clarify what position so in your in your deputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to fill themselves just in terms of the overall structure of the advisory group they would effectively be filling the roles of chairing of facilitating and the secretariat so effectively two goes ahead is that worse right yeah and with respect we 've always shown respect to the staff and we 've willingly incorporated them within all meetings but we believe that this would turn any meeting into a check box exercise when where community members no longer have a real participatory role where they 're simply just attending just a follow-up lord mayor the ceo might have to answer it are you assuming that 's what 's going to happen or have you been told that 's what 's going on it 's uh appeared in our minutes which uh were not signed off by the chairs and sent um uh on friday in in a surprise uh rush in in the lead up to uh the this meeting uh the minutes contain details of a proposed change to the terms of reference that were not discussed at the meeting and they include updates again that were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these minutes that 's been declined we have ourselves needed to retract these minutes because they were not a true and accurate record of what happened at the meeting three weeks ago okay thank you thank you councillor clayton uh councillor gordon thank you lord mayor um my question is whether you 're aware of how the other advisory groups to this city as established and it seems at this stage the other groups are um advisory to the city whereas your group 's established as advisory to the council so are you aware of that distinction and why do you think that yours should be different or i 'm a firm believer that we need to raise the tide for all um i do believe that this advisory group was formed in a unique circumstance so as a circumstance where the city had to step up but it 's a circumstance where we shouldn 't relegate ourselves uh in the future but just because other groups decide to to work under a different format i would advocate that all groups should have a be part of a strategic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oversight role in these advisory groups uh councillor angie thanks david so in relation to those three roles what would you how would you like to see that operate a sharing of responsibility between all of you and the administration or how would you like to ideally see that evolve i think that there 's honestly no reason to change how we have been set up you know i mean the council set up this advisory group with two chairs and um and a group of it 's an advisory group chairs around it um i don 't think that made any sense let me say that again the council set us up and i believe it was actually your motion um uh councillor angie to have two chairs and then the rest of the seats of the advisory group um these we do believe that that 's the best optimal way to ensure that there is community engagement and and to to to take some of these opportunities in the plan to the next level and come up with some really innovative ideas as you can see in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear that if the advisory group is managed um rather than innovating um that had that been the case the document itself would probably only be you know half the size that it is i 've added that um at the moment we 've been operating on the basis of the community participates via chairing and by contributing we 've always welcomed the positive contribution from staff to facilitate and to of course provide secretariat services we honestly know that we can 't do this without the staff however when when we go with months without meetings and roadblocks and and uh curious issues like the the minutes that i mentioned uh well there really isn 't the goodwill there to trust that all responsibilities for a meeting would all lie with staff um can i just say i mean i 'm i 'm a little bit confused here be and the reason i say that is because in my 12 months in this building rubbing shoulders with the staff and administration of the city of perth i have only ever found and i appreciate that 's coming from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our administration to be enormously supportive of the lgbtqi plus community and indeed the establishment and ongoing success of the lgbtqi plus advisory group i know the levels of pride with which our staff have felt and celebrated the advisory group and how much of their spirit i believe is fostered in the advisory group so to hear tonight that you feel that the administration is not supportive is getting in the way is not cooperative i 've got to say is a surprise to me and it has not been my experience in my own personal conversations with many of our staff who have reveled in the fact that we have been leading the way in this space with the establishment of the advisory group so perhaps you might like to comment on that in uh in july lord man when unfortunately you weren 't able to chair um one of the council meetings i was delighted to speak towards a deputation that was congratulatory and aspiring for staff i truly believe that staff were on a journey to come with us in building a community partnership however there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent plan in front of us contains a statement where we were declined the ability to use our own words and have it attributed to us this is a statement that is from us as co-chairs and we were being told that we had to use the words of others these are kind these are the roadblocks that are almost inexplicable and perhaps i might might explain it as you know you might love something that you hug it too tight that you try to control the process too tightly and in the end you suffocate it we believe that the community needs to have a role and that 's what we 're arguing for lord mayor um i would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge that you know lauren sam conrad this has been a passion project for all three of them what we are concerned about is changing the process with which we are already operating it 's yielded amazing results um it 's brought some great media attention and um and it 's it 's it 's positioning the city of perth in a leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just don 't want that process to be disrupted going forward by changing the way the accountability of it okay are there any other questions counselor lisa thank you lord mayor just one quickly we haven 't really talked about the plan are you happy with the plan as it 's before us we i i can say the work of the plan was the work of six months of the beginning of the year when the community was in the driving seat i know there 's been a lot of staff changes and i appreciate that that has made it hard met perhaps even culturally to kind of bring up to speed but where we were in june and july is very different from where we are now i 'm proud that the recommendations have survived in full but i i i 'm worried where we take take it so yes i can fully recommend the plan and its recommendations counselor uh thanks lord mayor um i just want to ques ask uh the ceo a question i think that uh that has to happen during the debate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that okay yeah sorry lord the item before you said that we were able to ask the staff questions about deputy it was the other way is it the other way was it yeah so we can 't clarify anything that 's been said you can during debate dude okay no further question from any councillors the hub we 've got a property review going on right now i 'm not comfortable with it being a stand-alone hub are you okay with it being incorporated into a broader multi-use facility look i think to be to be completely honest um it 's very early days it 's in the plan yeah but we we don 't we haven 't done a feasibility study scoping study or anything else we don 't i mean that would that would actually take some time obviously um you know i 'm not going to say that i agree with anything just yet but um but i don 't see why not however i do know that there is um strong uh support for a hub of its own i acknowledge that it wouldn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean this is this is where things grow right we we 're not going to build a new optic stadium um tomorrow or anything like that um you know it starts off small and then it turns into something a decade down the track or something like that you know managing expectations yeah that 's all these things you get carried away so as long as you know it 's not going to be optus stadium yeah that 's a good start but if you could just sign off on jagen square just on that i think yeah figuring out scope and uh being realistic is important but um at this stage we we 're conscious that it 's a real it needs to we need to bring the community with us and in any any community type project you need uh engagement and that goes back to what we 've been talking about all tonight thanks again gentlemen uh there 's no further question so we appreciate you being here and uh to paul elaine again happy birthday thank you very much uh we moved to um item six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest the following interests have been

agreed the minimum score threshold of 70 would be appropriate but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the percentage score was for this proponent could i please have that comment sure thanks council laser ceo thank you lord mayor and to the general manager community development sorry i don 't have the actual number in front of me but in terms of the threshold has been met as as per the report thank you council lisa counselor angie yeah i just had a few questions i submitted them prior to the answer thank you now yeah feel free to answer those questions okay thank you um so a couple of the questions were covered by the responses to the deputation my other question one of my other questions was i note the administration 's statement this application was received as an unsolicited bid on 24th of august not an events application however it was assessed as an events application have specific criteria been developed for the unsolicited bid category ceo thank you lord mayor and if i could direct to the general manager community development and possibly for ease of other questions if we should just um yep thank you thank you through the lord mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the unsolicited bid category as each application is required to be assessed against clear criteria for a fair and transparent assessment in previous years west tech fest have applied under the city 's economic development sponsorship program and due to the city 's sponsorship and grants program being on pause the administration accepted the application under the events sponsorship program due to alignment to the assessment criteria and the ability to benchmark the application against applications submitted for round one of the event sponsorship program thank you general manager uh councillor angie i 've got a few questions sure um the next question is i note the administration 's statement that the city has a vision for perth to be the events heart of wa from our event strategy and under the heading of strategy on page 15 of the report the only relevant report listed is the event strategy my question is are there any other documents relevant to this application for example just on scanning a few documents sorry i 'm just reading this of the computer the strategic community plan page 16 talks about a can-do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally through a willingness to assist and encourage page 18 a strategic community plan the internet has caused remarkable expansion in digital technology and harnessing the virtual world and important to all facets of society so um in this regard i 'm just wondering if there 's any other relevant strategies that should have been considered or could have been jim ah through you lawmere we 've noted that the city 's strategic pillars livable sustainable and prosperous reflect the current priorities of this council and are referenced in the council report i 'll also make a comment that the initiatives that support continued growth and development of tech startup and innovation sectors will be included in the city 's economic development strategy which is currently under development council angie thank you um one more question have any matched funding grants been provided by the city of perth in the past in the past year that is 50 50 grants as opposed to 30 70 one i can recall is activate perth of a hundred thousand in december are there any other examples jim ah through you lord mayor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a business improvement grants where there were two streams to apply and non-match funding up to ten thousand and match funding up to twenty thousand and the precinct development grants with a breakdown as follows so the business improvement grants there were eight non-matched funding grants up to ten thousand and eight matched funding grants up to twenty thousand the activate perth uh precinct development grant was a hundred thousand fulfill this space council has also endorsed a city fortune investments proposed extension to the on the point jetty 439 000 but the applicant has since withdrawn their application thanks gm uh thank you um did say the last one last time but it 's okay sorry the last question is what does the city currently do to support the growth of the tech sector in perth that is what a specific city initiatives in this regard i know a few example of tech initiatives across the country for example the city of sydney 's tech startup action plan city of melbourne 's emerging technology test beds brisbane business hub for startups and others as ceo thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager planning and economic development to respond sure so in addition to the wet west tech fest we 've supported the establishment of early co-working spaces including space cubed and other underutilised spaces in the city we 've supported the work of startup wa which has included startup ecosystem reports in 216 and 220 we 're a supporter of startup news we 've worked with the perth angels on a variety of initiatives including their angels breakfast and also an angel investing masterclass session as well as commissioned a report into how to unlock further investment with perth angels into our tech ecosystem we 've also supported hackathons and other programs including startup weekend and founder institute we 've worked with startups across industry verticals such as medtech and proptech and given funding towards the development of research into the growth and development of perth startup ecosystem uh the city has been accompanied by members of perth 's startup industry to attend the global innovation and entrepreneurship fair in chengdu one of our sister cities to give exposure and international trade opportunities to local startups we also have a reciprocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to travel to perth and utilize their office space and vice versa and we 've also supported initiatives for the continued growth and development of the tech startup and innovation sectors which will be included in the city 's economic development strategy which is currently under development thanks general manager we 're also live streaming our council meetings which in some way fits into that space which is excellent thank you for that response was there any more thank you lord mayor i 'd like to can i just at this point i deputy lord man do you mind just popping up here please because i am busting to go to the lord thank you jeffy lord mayor so i 'd like to move an amended motion i 've put this forward to the administration previously so they have the words for the screen so i 'll read that out so that the council approves an event sponsorship to 32 degrees south group propriety limited for west tech fest totaling 125 000 excluding gst comprising 120 223 cash contribution and up to 4777 in kind support for city fees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding thank you councillor angie can you check the screen and make sure it reflects what you 're after thank you do we have a second the emotion the amended motion secondary counselor ko counselor angie do you want to uh give you a reason for the amendment thanks debut lord mayor so tech is not only an important but a critical global sector with the largest companies in the world being tech companies as outlined in the deputation again think of canberra and what great ambassadors they are for perth and they started at west tech as i noted in my questions other cities across australia have plans to attract tech and and it 's great to see some of the initiatives the city of perth is currently supported as outlined by the administration previously i recently met someone who had just relocated to perth from copenhagen so the tech company that she worked for in copenhagen had plans to move to singapore but when covert hit they diverted to the safe shores of perth as pointed out the deputation this is the this is the point in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tech startups to perth to grow their businesses we need more people to know that perth is a tech hub and this is just the kind of event to do this to be honest i knew nothing about west tech or tech until i was sent along by the city of perth to deliver a speech at last year 's event by talking to people at the event at the event i found out more and was so impressed by the west tech story by way of background because this wasn 't in in the papers and for those of you who might not know anything about it like i didn 't last year it was founded in 2011 and it 's the premier annual innovation technology conference for wa attracting founders tech leaders and investors from australia us uk and asia now in its tenth year west tech has successfully grown from a one day conference to a genuine multi-day festival that is a hallmark event for the local innovation ecosystem the festival program combined content combines entrepreneurship investment and technology with high level networking events bringing together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event organizers place significant effort in attracting interstate and international investors to come to perth to see the talent expertise and potential investment opportunities firsthand through the involvement of bill thai a silicon valley based global venture capitalist and adjunct professor of innovation and economic development with curtin university the event has created strong linkages and relationships with leading entrepreneurs and investors from silicon valley an early investor in companies such as twitter and zoom bill chai has been instrumental in the development of perth 's start-up ecosystem having invested in number of perth-based startups and assisting successful funding rounds for companies such as canberra even for example in 2020 westcheck program featured a fireside chat via zoom with bill ty interviewing ceo and founder of zoom eric ewan people in perth would not otherwise have these opportunities in recent years organisers have seized on the opportunity presented by first location within the indian ocean to increase promotion of the event with delegates from key markets such as singapore malaysia indonesia hong kong and china and taking this live stream online as we are tonight when covert made this not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifestyle i recall being told by one of the founders last year that perth was ideal for this event with people when borders opened to the world could come from all over the world to experience not only tech but also things like windsurfing and our great climate and outdoors lifestyle it 's for all of these reasons and the reasons provided in the deputation that in closing i urge my fellow councillors to support this amendment on its merits and support the motion this sponsorship is modest when we compare to the potential benefits outlined to draw a comparison the targa west that we sponsorship we approved you know just a few months ago was 93 000 it 's just one example at the lord mayor 's brand perth forum on the theme of city of lights one attendee talked about perth being the city of bright ideas this event attracts bright ideas and bright people thank you thank you councillor angie and thank you also deputy lord mayor for uh occupying the chair for a brief moment my apologies a councillor co as the second of the amended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i think sandy oh sorry um uh counselor angie um uh put all of this into great words i feel i myself love technology and i grew up i actually studied computer science this sort of stuff gives opportunity for young people to participate bring their ideas forward and actually get involved in things like technology which is one of the most renewable industries you can think of being a programmer is one of the most renewable occupations you can ever do so i 'm i i believe this this event will be able to put perth on um on the international stage and with the increase in funding i 'm hoping that um the organizers will be able to um give us a great event thank you councillor k is there anybody else that wishes to speak for the motion amended amended motion uh yes council government thank you lord um just a few questions um the budget implication or the financial implications under point 16 of the uh the report uh notes that we have a one million dollar total budget amount for event sponsorship and the officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion would effectively put 120 of that as cash what other events are for lack of a better phrase at risk of not being delivered or are we likely to see any of the cities events drop off or external events drop off what 's the implications thanks councillor governor ceo thank you to the general manager community development ah thank you through the lord mayor the city events are separate so the signature events are through a separate budget and they won 't be affected by any decision that could be made today and in terms of other events in terms of what could be forthcoming we 're not aware of all events that could be put forward and obviously we 're going through a review of the next phases of programs so any reduction in budget will obviously reduce um the available expenditure for the rest of the year thanks jim was there another question counselor government no specific events that we 're aware of that could be impacted okay thank you my other follow-up question i guess isn 't relevant but um if the city does become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount during the media financial review to perhaps plug that gap if council does decide to increase the funding for the event ceo if i could direct to the project director strategic finance with regards to that um thank you very much with the chair um council always has the opportunity to consider its budget position and make an amendment um i would merely offer a caution around spending what we 're not sure we actually currently have thank you uh i 've yes one final question then um best way of putting it oh look i think i 'll leave it for now okay yeah you can take it you know uh i actually know you can 't uh councillor gordon you 're speaking against i would also like to ask some questions certainly um does the city have a copy of last year 's attendance figures and how do they compare to the 3 300 people forecast to attend this year thank you councillor gordon ceo to the general manager community development please ah thank you now i don 't have the exact details to hand and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're putting forward noting that there are a number of new events um the program is slightly different from the previous year councillor gordon and would the forecast figures normally include partnership events or just the main events ceo hi jim thank you through there the budget that was provided was the 250 000 for their events so that was what was provided in their submission thanks jim uh can we go back to council government the question isn 't it yeah council gordon were you done okay council of government sorry let me remember no apology necessary council goal it 's your chamber as much as mine uh for for a lot of our uh events we get some information and return on investment and direct economic impact um what 's the likelihood or what 's what sort of information are we likely to get from the applicant or indeed from the event from the city 's own information to increase the funding to this amount that 's here to the gm community development it is noted that in terms of the submission now and there is a comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the um there 's no clear indication of previous success customer satisfaction or demonstration of quality so it was only attendance figures provided it is recommended project evaluation data is mandatory and sponsorship agreement and acquittal be outcome-based with sufficient evidence so that 's something that we can clarify further yeah and is that something that we can just require as of right with the amendment as we see it now or is that is that some follow-up information that we can request or do we need to mandate that through this amendment that is something that we can identify when we go through the process of advising them of any of the decisions by council and i 'd also just add that this is really the end of the previous structure for the grants and sponsorships in terms of we will be more outcome focused for the future ones such as the local activation grants currently available thank you now is there anybody who wishes to speak for the amended motion is there anybody who wishes to speak against the amended motion counselor gordon thank you lord mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has policies and processes in place for for various reasons it may need to ensure consistent decision-making um and on this occasion to increase the funding to 50 is not in line with our previous decision making i note in the office 's report it said the application lacks sufficient evidence or justification for a substantial funding increase including limited demonstration of how the 2022 event will have increased capacity reach attendance and outcomes also note that the 2019-2020 and 2020-21 acquittal report contains no evaluation data only attendance figures with no clear indication of previous success customer sex satisfaction or demonstration of quality um if we 're just looking at the figures for the main event we 're talking 350 people the officer 's recommendation already has that at 165 ahead of ratepayers money but if we 're increasing it that 's 357 dollars per head which is seemingly excessive normally match funding grants are up to twenty thousand dollars they target a different area um so if we 're proposing to match this funding it 's inconsistent with the current processes of this local government from the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government putting in 10 grand so why our rate payers will now be required to contribute 125 000 again just to me seems excessive so i 'm happy with the officers recommendation because it 's in line with our previous decision making thanks councillor gordon is there anybody else that wishes to speak for the amended motion or against the amended motion uh councillor angie to close the debate thanks lord mayor just addressing some of the issues raised by fellow councillors so in terms of budget as clarified by the administration there is remaining budget left in the pool of funds available for sponsorships so so that um you know where it 's up to us to consider where that budget 's applied in terms of numbers i think it 's clear that this type of event is something that is not necessarily purely based on numbers but something that profiles our city um in terms of it being a possible check heart global tech heart in the world and the opportunities that they cut that are available in perth for startups in terms of lifestyle and other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my initial statements but this is not purely about driving numbers of people into the city yes there will be people coming in for the free events but it 's about creating identity and brand for our city as a smart city as i said before a city of bright ideas and there is a precedent for match funding this did come through the unsolicited bid category and as we saw you know for example on a similar scale they activate perth match funding of a hundred thousand dollars so although um it is different it 's come through a different category we are currently in the process of an entire reset of our sponsorship strategy and policy and the administration 's working through that at the moment so i think it 's up to the council in this instance to set the direction of you know what we would like to see in terms of sponsorship and policies in terms of information you know often it 's the case that there 's been amendments to to um items of sponsorship just one one that comes to mind for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um increased funding to the christmas pageant i think a couple meetings ago and there 's been another of other amendments so you know and these amendments happen i think if we if we started as a council passing the entire um agenda on block i think that 's that 's not what we 're here to do we 're here to ask questions we 're here to look at the big picture and we 're here to set the strategic direction for our council so again as i said before i urge my fellow councillors to support this great initiative for perth that celebrates perth as a smart city as the place for tech thanks councillor angie so i 'll now vote on the amended motion all those in favor of the amended motion and that is councillor co councillor angie and councillor bevan all those against the amended motion and that 's council elisa councillor governor the lord mayor deputy lord mayor and councillor gordon the amended motion has been lost five to three so we now return to the primary motion my understanding it was while i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity to speak and chose not to am i right is there anybody else that wishes to speak for the primary motion or against the primary motion we 'll now put the primary motion to the vote unless councillor gobbett wished to close out the debate uh all those in favor of the primary motion and that is carried unanimously or yes it is unanimous isn 't it eight zip thank you uh we could let fleet and our council of fleet and come back in affectionately we call him fleet in here the term of india he loves it uh we moved now to item 12.3 final lgbtqi a plus plan 2021 2024 and no interests have been declared here i note that right yeah um so firstly you could have a move as somebody to move a motion to deal with this item counselor government to move a alternate motion with the effect being the officer 's recommendation minus 0.2 and just one moment please okay could i have a second to there please uh councillor government council of bevan sorry councillor bevan uh councillor gobert thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of history on this uh plan as it has been presented to us before uh going out for comment um and i 'll keep my comments brief to the point of part two in my experience when council creates an advisory group or a committee the terms of reference are set by the council for a reason and it is that they are to advise the council i 'm quite happy with the terms of reference to remain as being set by the council i think that it 's it would set a bit of a precedence that i 'm not comfortable with personally and i would like to retain that oversight i 'm not prepared to delegate that function to the administration so i think that there 's a lot to celebrate and acknowledge that has gone into the plan as it is and um i think we we 're on the right track so i 'm comfortable with proceeding with the officer 's recommendation uh part one only thank you uh thank you council government councillor bevin was the second uh nothing further to add thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council okay uh thank you lord mayor um i just want to say thanks counselor governor for your comments um i i believe i think we just need to make it clear that the council cares about what happens in this committee and we want to know what 's going on so i i would like to actually attend the next meeting uh when that actually happens um so um i 'm in support of the plan and i would like to and i would like to see 0.2 redacted at this stage and um let 's see how we go let 's try and make the best best of this weekend thank you councillor cos anybody wish to speak against the motion council god you i just want to jump in and speak for it okay uh well in that case anyone else anyone wish to speak for yes please um i 'd just like to congratulate the advisory group and our staff on the plan that they have presented to us it 's very well considered um and obviously a lot of work has gone into it potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i will support um councillor goberts and then alternate motion not necessarily because i agree with everything that 's been said local government is a heavily regulated environment and it can bring out frustration because you think the administration are working against you when in fact they 're trying to work with you to deliver the same thing but they are just more familiar and more confined in terms of how they operate so it 's it can be frustrating removing recommendation treatments it can be revisited at a later date and perhaps that can be better consulted with you or better consulted with me so i can understand why that 's the desirable outcome so that is why i will support the alternate motion thanks councillor gordon is there anybody else that wishes to speak uh well firstly is there anybody that wishes to speak against the alternate motion i 've asked that already i think anybody else that wishes to speak for councillor angie thanks lorna yeah just in favor of the amended motion i guess i think we saw the passionate response from in the deputations about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group so if we 're talking about genuine engagement then you know if that 's what we need to have genuine engagement then i think we should keep that that arrangement in place because i do recall the meeting earlier on in the year where we had i could only describe as a beautiful deputation in support of both the process and the plan and i was so proud that you know to see the um the community pleased with the opportunity to work with the city together hand in hand and there does seem to have been some kind of misunderstanding in the interim so um it 'd be good to keep that up and just as a final point i 'm just pleased that this whole thing has been managed to be um completed in a year i remember putting this up as a notice of motion i think it was exactly this time last year so to think we 've come a very long way in just one year from when that notice of motion went up so thank you everyone thank you councillor angie anybody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love me sorry that 's all right just got me die um i 'd like to support councillor gobert 's motion because until and unless elected members are convinced that the committee is functioning at a level which we 're all comfortable with it would be prudent for any decisions to alter alter its terms of reference to be brought back to elected members for ratification and not to be determined by the ceo or the staff only i 'll just add that i 'm a bit concerned at what i 've heard tonight regarding the governance of these meetings especially when i 've seen how hard the ceo has worked to deliver her program of an evolution to excellence agendas and minutes are basic governance essentials and should be taken very seriously and personally i 'd like to see the minutes of all our city committees going forward if that 's possible thanks thank you deputy lord mayor um i just had a question to ask um so yeah there are a number of advisory groups within the city of perth and are they structured differently does the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those other advisory groups terms of reference mostly these advisory groups are under the community development alliance so if i could refer to the general manager sure thank you the other advisory groups that support council endorsed plans are all structured in the way of administration sharing and doing the agenda and the minutes and for the elders advisory group and the access inclusion advisory group and we also have a culture and arts advisory group that 's the same in terms of chaired by administration terms of reference are also done administratively thank you thank you um were there anybody else that wish to speak for or against um just a few comments that 's right speaking in favor but i just want to address a few things that come up in the deputation more broadly so it 's an advisory group it 's not an extension of council the committee members are bound by code of conduct and i 'm aware of um the comedy of me lecturing people on code of conduct but one thing that needs to be remembered in this environment is we 've already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests in the city of perth there 's finite resources it 's a it 's a great plan as i said before i 've learned a lot but we need to be mindful that we all need to pull in the same direction this advisory group needs to teach the nine people around this table and help us along the way i don 't want to get into a situation where we 're competing against each other um so i just wanted to point that out happy with the terms of reference being said by council happy with councillor gobert 's amendment thank you councillor fleeton is there anybody else for or against um given the passionate nature of the deputations and uh i did say what i had to say earlier uh in defense of the staff generally on the defense but in support of the staff generally i do think it might be appropriate here to give the general manager an opportunity if there was any points that were raised in those deputations there was some strong sentiment expressed there and i think it 's the fair thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's any points you may wish to clarify thank you lord mayor um in terms of the deputation and in terms of the item coming forward i want to start by saying the organization highly values all the advisory groups and is particularly pleased with this plan and the progress that 's been done and the involvement and commitment from all of the advisory group members so that goes without any need to go further into that but we would not have the plan we have today if it wasn 't for all advisory group members the second point i would make is that we acknowledge that the advisory group was a very unique circumstance because we didn 't have strategic direction so there was no plan in place and the purpose for which council set up has that was done in december i believe that the advisory group has really exceeded the expectations there in delivering both the diversity inclusion and equity framework and also this plan my third point is i suppose that the a couple of comments just for clarity the terms there was a comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met with the advisory group on the sixth of uh where we 're now october the year is flying on the 6th of october and we took them through the structure for the other advisory groups and highlighted that for those advisory groups there is already a structured plan and their role of the advisory groups is then to help administration deliver the actions that have been endorsed by council in that strategic plan so the reference was not that we would change the terms of reference and that was why we explained that we would put it back to council for council to make a decision of how they wanted the advisory group to proceed in terms of the emphasis from a different phase in terms of development stretch of the strategy we spoke with the advisory group about the use of the other advisory groups and things like the aboriginal advisor group where we the elders advisory group which has helped us do innovations like the academia biddy agreement which is completely outstanding innovative but is done in the advisory group format through administration that was explained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how the structure is as determined by council we will continue to want to work innovatively and in a leadership role to make a difference and we want to do that together the last comment i 'd make is in terms of i think there was a comment in regard to the chairs not being provided opportunity to make the statement in the plan that they wanted there was a statement in the original draft plan that i think actually went out or just prior and the co-chairs had then advised administration they wanted that statement to be revised you 'll notice in the item that we actually refer to that that statement was amended and administration took the effort to go out to all the advisory group members and get their endorsement of whether the change was supported and the majority of the members supported the change so it was implemented in the final plan under the existing terms of reference that were set by council it was clearly stated that the agenda was to be developed in consultation with the co-chairs but it also said that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisory group themselves so our customer and practice for the minutes has been to provide the notes unconfirmed minutes to the advisory group for them to confirm so we are complying with the terms of reference and we believe that if there 's any misconstrued items in there that it is something that the group need to confirm their interpretation as well so that we are very much trying to use all of the advisory group members fully in the development of the plan and in the feedback happy to take on board any further opportunities for improvement or consultation but we are very focused on irrespective of what decision is here by council that we work collaboratively in leadership innovatively for the good of the community so thank you thank you general manager i appreciate that clarity there just before we put it to the vote if there 's nothing further for anybody for or against is there council government closed yes okay uh please um yeah just picking up on um i think council of koh 's points um look i don 't personally see an issue with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the advisory group to watch to learn to gain insight into how the group functions i personally don 't see a problem with that um although i have taken the points of other elected members being directly involved as the chair or as a member i think look yeah lesson learned for me that 's probably a step too far but observing i don 't see a problem with that at all and i would echo the comments of councillor gordon in that a lot of the things that we do in this industry not just local to this local government but i would say that with eight years experience as an elected member is frustratingly long term and sometimes you just have to take that one in the chin and just accept that things take time to do so although there 's a lot of a lot of good things in this plan i would just counsel to say be prepared to work to that over a long period of time although as we have heard tonight some things can be done quicker than others so particularly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bain 's points in that um i think the council absolutely needs to retain that um or not divest that delegation and until that i can be personally satisfied that the group is functioning well and we 're getting the right advice that i would want to retain that oversight so with that i 'll close and ask for my fellow elected members support thank you thank you councillor god we 'll put it to the vote just before we put it to the vote can i thank you both paul elaine and david for your very kind letter dated september 9 which i think fellow councillors also were the recipients of so we will put this to the vote now all those in favor they are counsellors leave oh it 's unanimous thank you

event space now and uh seconded by councillor lisa thank you council lisa anybody wish to speak for um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council those are anything you 'd like to say uh councillor angie i just had a question so um in the report it says there 's 10 000 that 's come from the heritage perth weekend i was just given that that 's like a much smaller overall budget so it 's a much bigger proportion of that budget is there a reason that 10 grand was taken out of heritage perth and not that 10 grand just didn 't come out of that overall bigger budget of australia day ceo sorry what was that so ten thousand dollars for this 175 thousand dollars appears to have come from the heritage uh perth week it 's just that that 's a small budget event already so that 's awesome there 's a reason why it 's come from heritage thank you to our guests tonight uh happy birthday um can i please invite the general manager community development to respond to that gm uh thank you we actually believe there 's some savings uh in terms of how we 're doing our marketing we did quite a lot of hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found with some other festivals is uh having that online is is the quicker as the events

that we do what a great day this is the crew of the hmas perth right in the heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of us i am well aware that the hmas perth has gone through a period of renewal and regeneration and a reimagination as is our city of perth where we stand right now a 1.5 billion dollar city deal with a university just to our left soon to bring around 10 000 people every day into our city of perth and rose street just behind us the winds of change have begun this ceremony dates back to medieval times it 's quite beautiful it 's quite special and it 's wonderful to have you all here today and how special it is that the hmas perth is based here off the coast of western australia right near the city from where she takes her name that 's very special to us the origin of the privilege of freedom of entry and the colorful ceremony attached to the granting of entry by a city has a much deeper and historical significance than the modern ceremony that you see this morning in the 11th century walled cities in europe and european trained soldiers for defensive measures and city protection were behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and modernized and today it represents all of the great things about our royal navy all of the great things about our city and all of the great things about the hmas perth and what i particularly love are those former crew members of the hmas perth being so proud of what the modern incarnation represents and being here today to enjoy the splendor and the pageantry so like the crew of the hmas perth and indeed the beautiful ship perth is on a journey of modernization but very very mindful of the great traditions of the past we 're a city on the move and we 're a city that is excited about our future and as i look out today and see the faces of the people who are on the ship the hmas perth i 'm reminded of what service means how important it is and how in this time when many of our friends and family and other parts of australia aren 't experiencing these great freedoms and privileges that we have how lucky we are to be associated with perth how lucky we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how lucky we are to have people who protect us when we need protection that 's what the navy does that 's what our armed forces do and that 's what those who are custodians of our great state and city have been good enough to do for all of us over this recent period can i acknowledge also the city of perth brass band and those of you who are here today might like to give them a round of applause it 's wonderful to see our band out alongside the navy band nothing suggests that a city is alive and well like color and movement and music and to both of our bands here today how glorious it is and perhaps ladies and gentlemen just perhaps today 's great pageant and ceremony is a forerunner of another parade that we might have through the streets of perth in a little under four weeks wouldn 't it be magnificent to have two competing afl teams right here where we are now for a grand final parade on the friday before the afl grand final comes to perth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we thank the crew of the hmas perth for honoring us for being here for everything that you do to keep us safe and to many of you who i just had the opportunity to chat with in our brief walk around i know many of your families are not here with us today they are interstate or in some cases overseas and they are not as lucky as we are our thoughts are with them and our thoughts are with you separated from those people closest to you final thing for me to say to the ladies and gentlemen before me first beer is on me in about 45 minutes we 'll see you then thank you everybody what a great day [Applause] thank you look thank you lord mayor would you please all stand as hmas perth gives a general salute to the people of the city of perth [Music] us [Music] goddamn assistance [Music] i so [Music] up [Applause] wow [Music] thank

    "text": "[Music] thank you thank you for joining us with the various hats i wear earlier this year i did feel like all worlds were exploding in terms of our escalation of work with business foundations fremantle port authority gaming and wagering so a huge amount of um incredible change but what really i guess touched me day to day was was the way we as advisers responded to the desperate need for advisory to each business owner through the generosity of of many local councils and city of perth definitely been one of them uh and and immediate trust so what what i found personally was whilst with businesses you 're running businesses there 's this myriad of um balls that you 're juggling around you know strategy moving forwards marketing yes finance you 're juggling all this but during the the restrictions it narrowed down really quickly to survival and survival meant cash flow management uh there were some probably very few businesses who did that well but it was a case of forecasting so and moving forward thinking ahead as brian said as phil said this this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way we operate under uncertainty great uncertainty but what you can do as business owners is put in place measures around cash flow forecasting if you don 't already do it so this was kind of essential for survival and all we could manage to to help forecast was one week at a time for three months and if they could get towards three months planning that was that was brilliant in itself so having those robust measures around cash flow management now in preparation for whatever lays ahead because that uncertainty is with us for a long time to come but also as business owners the next step uh is is the review of of your business um expenses so that the fixed expenses which we talked about that whether you open the doors or not you 've got to pay them so so reviewing all those fixed expenses reviewing your variable expenses how can we do it better and this is this is the time now where we have a fair bit of stability kind of do these reviews now because it 's it 's just there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lockdown comes or when anything else comes we don 't know what it 's going to be so doing that review of your financial statements now we certainly are there to help you do that as advisors making sure you secure funding that 's available so for example city of perth has small business grants available and and certainly whippersnapper has taken advantage of that five thousand dollars but there 's there is funding available try and secure it now try and get find out about it and you know it 's available to you but also taking it a step further is is around cash flow ratios like as a business owner you can have your finger on the pulse just by monitoring your your ratios week by week month by month now i know this is kind of like maybe finance stage three but if you need help around that that 's that 's another thing we do as well so without further due um i thought it would be really interesting to hear from um a real life client of ours um whippersnapper distillery who responded um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us a rundown looking at earlier this year the impact on your cash flow for whippersnapper and how did you respond how did you survive i guess we 're a bit different from many businesses with different facets so we make products that we sell at the cellar door with a small kind of coffee shop associated with it we sell a lot into the retail market as wholesaler and we export some so we 've got a few different clients in a few different different spaces but at least for us it kind of happened a bit slower than a lot of people have quite quickly so from december we started to see the drop-off in chinese buying some international visitation into january we saw we saw that increase further and then we kind of covered hit we saw obviously we were locked down so we couldn 't have people attend are we going to do take away sales we had the government impose a restriction that allowed us to only sell one bottle um to one person per day and then of course all the other restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of depth by thousand cuts to our business so from january onwards there was this emerging kind of thing about hand sanitizer and we we rejected uh doing that a lot of other distilleries jumped on it far earlier than than we did and other distilleries probably um partly caused that problem by buying huge quantities of ethanol earlier to create some of that some of that shortage we had this effect of declining um income revenue and then we started to see through social media there was perhaps a little bit of a backlash like and we saw it from the medical circle and fraternity a bit as well where people were kind of commenting on social media like why are you making hand sanitizer as if we were bad people because we weren 't doing it and we 're like look we 're not experts making our sanitizers we don 't know the chemicals that go into it plus we we ferment but it 's very inefficient very efficient so it logistically wasn 't easy but then we got to the stage where we talked to our staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together we were like what are we going to do we 're going to shut down are we going to do this have a go at it like yourselves most entrepreneurs were optimistic we 're also optimists as well and and so we we basically kind of i guess you call it pivoting but we just survived by shutting down whiskey production making hand sanitizer which is not a simple thing because buying grain to make it it 'll take us five to ten days to ferment it you know we 'll be talking to such small quantities it didn 't work so then we had to immediately kind of figure out all these steps in our supply chain and what we had in wa so we teamed up with um the fern grove winery which is a huge winery sells the bulk of their product into china we did deal with them we were buying basically the the worst stuff they had i remember having that conversation just give me the crappy stuff you 've got and as much of it as you can give me and then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move thousands of liters of wine from the deep south down near franklin up to us how do we then process it how do we do that fast enough so then we kind of pull stuff out of our front room put them out the back to basically run the still train them up as much as we could to operate that at a basic level and then start to do that and then how do we batch it up so then we teamed with a laboratory in mongolia which primarily focused on the mining industry so they brought their expertise to it and how we make ourselves tga compliant so in space for a week we shifted our whole business and managed to survive and keep us going so just picking up on a couple of key words there survival so this wasn 't just oh it seems like a fun thing to do you know this was survival not only for you guys as co-founders but you mentioned your staff every everything was on the line so um what a yeah what a difficult situation to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke to your staff you had your staff very engaged and i think that leans into what brian was saying that that need to to work together and the immediate cooperation with another group you know a winery that you probably had no prior dealings with so there 's this incredible um collaboration within a week so yeah we had that conversation probably like many of you did with your staff we called them in we made a decision at that stage to have a crack at the hand sanitizer and not to shut down so a few things we did um i moved everyone from casual to part time because it saved me another 25 in what i was paying out to them each week they also liked it from perspective of there was now subsequently because everyone was super worried about to get sick at that stage so they liked they liked that um and we basically looked at the skills of them and and so one of my main baristas he had the background engineering okay so you 're going to drive the ute down to franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's your job and then the others we put into training up and different things so i think they they get through in fact through this they actually made more money because as we started running longer days and more shifts and weekends and stuff they got monkeys and over time supplies and so actually brilliant probably pretty pretty happy through it it did help us in a way because they then had skills of ourselves and for example he actually ran still so now when he 's out taller people he can say i 've actually distilled and he actually knows what he 's talking about when he 's running the still so so there were advantages in that um but it didn 't it didn 't last that long for us the intensity of it i guess we 're quite good networkers in our industry so we were able to make those calls and on and talk to someone who gave me someone and i could i could make a deal with with fern grow for example very quickly it 's one of those situations where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in real life normally go out and talk to other people you get a feel because all right i can make that price work i 'll take it you know and in hindsight now some of those things i 'm like anyways past that but yeah so we kind of we 'd heard through the great line there was big quantities of hand sanitizer coming from overseas and interstate and it was really that surge bond that you saw in the shopping centre that that sucked it up so we didn 't we didn 't over commit to it but because we had to pivot so quick it did suck up more capital because you can 't change your business overnight so so there 's revenue going so we made a lot of revenue through hand sanitizer but we didn 't make a lot of a lot of profit out of it but that didn 't matter because we were we were surviving but then after about six weeks it started to drop off so kind of went through this peak went for about about 20 bucks a liter through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then it came down pretty fast and in may it just stopped overnight there was just no demand for it but thankfully then restrictions were lifted and then we had this surge in attendance and sales because i think people would pent up we just wanted your whiskey yeah and do stuff so we 're able to switch back so um interesting because you mentioned profit and cash flow and and this is something really important as business owners to be aware of the distinction you can have a really profitable business and struggle with cash flow and vice versa in which a snapper 's instance there was great cash flow for survival kept the doors open kept um staff employed but profitability wasn 't there so this is a really important distinction and i think because you guys um were one of our clients pre-march um you had already been through our growth program so so these guys you know you were well positioned um in terms of strategy finance marketing you already had that knowledge content but do you do you feel that as a result of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moving forwards to the new year i think that did but also the nature of our business um so our business we make whiskey takes a number of years to age you spend a huge amount of money putting in the barrel then you wait and then so as you can imagine from startup we 're basically running at a loss for a number of years and knowing that going forward as a pioneer in that industry we claimed close to running out of cash a few times and had to and we 're lucky to have a couple of people behind us that we could go back to and get a little bit more cash to go but then as soon as we had whiskey out we then you know you have to get your production up so you 're then having to grow even though you 've got your main product you 're waiting on you don 't have enough of it in terms of what we do day to day like we we have a challenging product because um as soon as it 's ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about half of it to the ato in excise straight away before it leaves the distillery and then we also have terms with our so if we 're selling direct to the public that 's great get cash next day probably like a lot of businesses but if we 're dealing with our wholesalers or we 're dealing with national chains like coals and forwards we 're looking at anywhere from 60 to 90 day terms some of them are really good through the pandemic and shorten them half my cash is going out straight away and then i 'm waiting 60 to 90 days next slide for my money to come back in and then for example last week we did a new product release so you 've got a huge amount of cash shot up and your product release and then you 're waiting for it to come back so i think over the last few years i don 't know maybe i 'm pre-programmed to just like work on my cash flow real time and so how do you do that like what tools do you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the pulse cash flow wise what what is it that you do that helps you to manage that so the first thing i do is i always have six monthly forecast day either through a mentor we do it together or i 've got my skill level up to the company where i 'm comfortable with doing that so i run xero i do an export dump into an excel document and then i kind of plug those numbers in and then the cash flow forecast that that 's a lot more challenging to do because we have some of these facts i talked about like the terms and then some people like distributors don 't pay you on time and then we do get some rebate from excise but the ato just seem to pay whenever they feel like it not on any schedule so you can 't it 's very difficult to plug that in the ato know their challenges and they 'll try to help you that 's not them it 's the legislation they 're working in fact they 're really good to work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberately to fund the the pivot i didn 't pay um poig but it was due i ran them up and said i 'm going with the cash i 'm going to pay back to you this month this one this month yeah and they were like 100 foreign well you can you can work around those things but the forecasts are challenging so i try to do that probably a couple of months out but they 're really best guesses to be honest because of these factors but what i what i 'm more doing is constantly in my own head and on paper going i 'll have this money coming in next week you can just zero that off that way and that money going out there and i 've got i 've got a fixed amount going up my wages every fortnight and so then to certain extent you prioritize so okay if i don 't get that money coming in now i 'm gonna delay paying them because they 'll whinge but that 's fine these people will have to pay straight away so and and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best guess but it 's better than not having anything it 's a plan and you don 't set up the plan and leave it you are updating it pretty much every day and it sounds like you 're updating it even more frequently than every day but you 're updating it constantly you 're seeing the impact on your bottom line week by week for at least three months and you guys do it physically so so important the the other thing that 's interesting you touched on is is what i call the working capital cycle which is is critical for cash flow management so the cycle of working capital it starts with when you buy inventory so cash is going out there you convert it to something it may be a product or you may provide a service then you have your customers that you 've sold to and your debtors you 're waiting on the funds to come in now for you guys the producing of the product is is extremely long term the whiskey has to ferment for long periods you 've got your debtors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not that 's an extended time period as well 30 60 days um and you 've also got the money going out to your creditors which are suppliers for items that you bought for your business um just general overheads so so what you have is a working capital cycle with a number of days in between each step and the faster you can spin that cycle the higher your cash flow in coming into your business but some things are fixed so you can 't hurry the production of your product but you can you can consider the terms and conditions with your debtors your customers that you 've got sales going out to them and how can you bring that cash in faster but also to your creditors how can you extend payment terms there so there 's all this that i think as business owners you really need to consider the number of days in between each of those cycles and how can you how can you spin it faster so maybe without even realizing it you 're already doing it um but it 's something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do to actually calculate the number of days between each section of your working capital cycle and how can you make it spin faster i remember doing the course of the enemy saying that to me and i can 't if i can 't change coles and woolworth 's distributors can 't i have no power i can 't tell them what i want from them so what i did is i went back to the people that we buy consumers off and then i asked for terms for them longer terms okay so at least that helps me in in that sense but the other big a big challenge that we have when you spend so our financial system is built around one year but we make a product now that we might not sell three four five years so that cost of production how do i compare that so the money i 'm making right now in terms of sales is built off the cost of production two three four five years ago so these these things are challenges as well we can get around that extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so what lies ahead for whippersnapper um well we we need to continue to grow like i guess i guess like all businesses you you grow where you die really which probably isn 't great for humankind it 's not a sustainable model but um you know we 're looking at the eastern states least in states is a huge market for um well it 's it 's about probably 85 percent of the spirits market in australia so it 's very difficult to make an entrance and get sales over there without having a presence so that 's why you see people like little creatures and boat rocker and colonial beer and all these people move over there so we 'd like to set up a second distillery over there at some stage so that we can then um build on that we 've got some internal governance stuff so at the start when we when we set up we we 've got a lot of small amounts of investment from a lot of people at some stage i 'd like to consolidate a lot of that and bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people don 't invest in businesses unless they know a lot about them or they invest in you and when they invest in you they do small amounts so we 've got to try and change that change some of them now get bigger strategic investors in that to help us that but allow us to keep the soul of our business and our brand and ourselves so that 's so that 's some of the things that we 'll look to do we 've got new products um we want to increase our production um we 've done a lot of work in forecasting what does that look like so how do we increase our production we could buy bigger equipment we could hire more people we could outsource you know so you look at things like your brand who you are what you stand for so that means outsourcing is out we do it all ourselves we do it all locally we do it all by hand okay big equipment don 't necessarily want to do that we don 't want to take a loan out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into repayments there are some advantages and i have to look into more this about instant tax write-offs and what that can be applied to in the next year so we might get some sort of but the next one will be um additional labor so we can run our equipment from five days a week to seven days a week and extend the days of the week so at the moment we build our production cycle around ocarina monday to friday but the yeast they don 't work to that cycle yeast just start on day one then five days later they die so they don 't care if it 's a sunday when they die so we 've got to try and you know get our staff to work around that right so and so we 've done a lot of modeling with okay what is that what will that cost look like in terms of the labor and um i 'm not account but i think the wording is throughput cost that additional cost of that right i think that sounds right um well done so so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really high so so what does that look like and it looks pretty good for us we can increase our profit increase our revenue quite a bit through making more although we have to wait longer to do that yes so so yeah there i guess some of the areas that we 're focused on looking at at the moment yes unlike brian i 'm convinced there won 't be another lockdown um so you know good luck yeah so what i 'm picking up i mean it 's really exciting plans ahead and what i 'm hearing is localization when i say localization australia-wide so this was something business owners quickly realized an ongoing focus is the danger of the globalization trend that australia had followed probably over the last 10 or more years that globalization is good and supply chain customers uh that are overseas is is great for business well we we quickly realized that that is a major risk to businesses and what we can rely on is is local local customers and local supply chain and and you 're doing that within australia look it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so jackie from the city of perth um you were a recipient of a small business grant um i 'm keen to hear how i know it was five thousand dollars to sum that 's a little little bit of money to some that 's a lot of money um how did that grant assist your business um during that phase when you were pivoting so i guess the first thing is don 't be scared to ask people for help and i 've never been afraid of doing that um we needed cash and like i said you can you can put on your credit card but all people i don 't want to borrow too much so how can i get it elsewhere uh i 've met murray jules in the ceo of city perth a couple events beforehand and i rang the city of perth and said can i talk to murray jordan see i 'm always good at distillery blah blah blah he actually ran me back that night i had his time that was good and i said look this is what we want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's got this grant thing which is fantastic and then he said leave it to me i 'll get one of my dd people to call you tomorrow and i 'll just help you develop a developer now um you know at a time he was saying look we 're trying to help everyone we can whatever way so that um they kind of push that through really quickly for us um so look it helped a lot that 5000 went towards purchasing ibcs some alcohol measuring equipment things all that that we needed to survive to have yeah so yeah so that generosity and it continues even now those small business grants through the city of perth are still available so um for any of you that don 't know where would they find that information on your website jackie it is on the website you can do your city personal fitness grants we have uh pops of prospectors in each of the bags as well so you can take that away with you but we will also be emailing out the details post this meeting great thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more i would be in the morning so i 'll do them at night and while i was watching tv even if it 's even if it 's crappy and it 's poor quality and i 'm just pushing it out there are heaps around the place um yeah it depends on what you 're doing ours is very much manufacturing yeah engaging with because we 're a lot about primary producers of farmers so that links have like deep herd well done any any other questions have you done much um collaborating with other businesses we try to we try to do as much as we can it varies so so some will be like a lot of bars and that sense so we 'll help them with marketing and merchandise and go in there and talk to them and build those our businesses build around relationships so collaboration is a natural part of it um and and so it can be at that really localized level where we 'll we 'll help them out we 're going to distort it through two they might have a product release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vice versa we 'll collab and we might share brand and stuff we have big collabs we do with with big bigger kind of players in our space like whiskey loop for example they they do lots of small gift packs under their own branding and so they they make big inroads into securing gift packs through audi and some of the chains through that type of thing one one of the cool things we did was at the end of um so as the hand sanitizer was phasing down all heaps of breweries that we 're friends with were really really struggling especially brew pubs couldn 't open they couldn 't sell it their product is in keg form it can 't you can 't suddenly use so we did a product that we call a brew moon where we got 21 breweries to give us kegs that were basically written off they brought them here we poured them all in together and then we distilled it all to make this um this moonshine product it 's a bit more like a gin we call them moonshine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got six bottles each and then we gave them so then we sold the rest ourselves and they got 500 back for those kids and they 'll get that we all put their name on the bottle um so yeah we tried to where we could help others for instance yes because i yeah i certainly had um one of my clients in fremantle a brewery same thing as the we 've got all these barrels and and it 's going to go all these problems that that challenges that uh were unheard of um unable to be imagined pretty much thankfully those guys are all killing it now yes yes exactly that 's that 's what we want and and you know i wish your business as well incredible success and i think you 'll you know having been through the most challenging year and survived and not only survive you 're thriving and you 've got really robust processes financial management processes in place that puts you in a good position for for that growth ahead um so it 's really exciting there 's a couple other little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point in our businesses cycle where i thought everything was going to work i took a screenshot of our bank accounts okay i 've still got that and i can go in there and see how little money we had it reminds me just how bad it was so everything i 've got now is way better than what it was and then the other ones it does i was there and i can do this yeah the other thing is because my stepfather was in vietnam and stuff i could read quite a bit of books and so i try and get things that distract me and often looking at people that were in far worse situations it puts everything in context like yes this is just nothing you know this is just my business you know yes you shut my door tomorrow still going to see my kids you know yeah still got my health uh and and this was the fundamentals that uh to to bring the fear and panic out of um what was happening and i and i think as advisers that was something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a space of uncertainty as well but getting to that point where you know you 're no longer thinking from a position of fear that 's being calmed so what do we do next this is where the strategy and the creativity comes through and it 's wonderful really wonderful to hear these are all the positive outcomes from this year 's experience and moving forward can you please put your hands together for carmelina"

    "text": "[Music] today we 're going to be talking about how to find the right digital tools and the right apps for your business and what i 'll do is walk you through a process that we use to help businesses find apps i want to kick things off with a bit of an activity just raise your hand if you have your phone within easy reach of you right now almost everyone you have your phone hey already in your hand beautiful all right so just use that hand to grab your phone now what i 'd like you to do is open your phone up and count the number of apps you currently have installed on your phone and i 'll make this a little bit easier for you typically on most phones they have between 20 and 30 apps per page if you count the number of pages you can get a guesstimate that 'd be cool too 22 all right so just buy a show of hands to get a bit of a temperature here just raise your hand if you have more than 20. more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right so we have a few people that have between 100 and 150. now go back and have a look at that screen again and count the number of ones you use on a regular basis so within the last week how many apps is that so a quick show of hands again um more than 10 yep more than 20 really okay more than 30. okay so most people more than 30 on a regular basis fair enough how many do you use on a regular basis 35 and 45. cool so um so me i have 140 apps installed on my phone and i use about 25 on a regular basis every week and there are three real observations that i make from this particular exercise the first is that it 's not really about finding apps right there 's an app for everything you know the android store has something like 2.56 million apps they 're available and then apple has i think 1.85 million available you know in 2008 when apple 's first launched the apple store first launched they had 500 apps so app @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right the second observation is that we only use a fraction of what we have installed on our phone would that be fair there were stats out of the us that said that two years ago i believe the average person had about 40 apps installed on their phone and they used about 18 so about 50 of them on a regular basis so and we had between 20 and 30 apps today in the room of what people use on a regular basis so it 's not about finding apps it 's about figuring out which ones solve the problems that we 're looking to solve which ones do we actually use if i was to ask you if you have an app installed on your phone that you 've never you you installed but never used would that be true for anybody here yeah yeah do you have apps that you 've used once and have never used again yeah yeah so it 's really about finding the ones that work for us that 's that 's the real key right and the third observation how tight are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it within arm 's reach right these things drive our lives quite literally yeah we rely on them so much and the reason why i point that out is that sometimes people say to me are you know we don 't need to you know i don 't use a lot of technology without realizing that it 's so ingrained in the way in which you know we operate these days it 's a natural thing and we rely on these things so much you only need to uh and and we don 't just rely on these things uh it 's also changing the way in which we interact with the world right do you agree with that it 's um you only need to hop on a train to look around you know walk onto a train look around and see everybody sitting on their phones earpods in listen to a podcast listen to music on social media you know it 's changing the way in which we interact with or technology has changed the way which we interact with the world netflix another example you know we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now we just have an ai driven interface that tells us exactly what we want to watch based on previous behavior you know it 's changing our behaviors and it 's changing our expectations around the world and how we interact with the world that also impacts how we act as consumers as well doesn 't it you know if technology is something that we 're tied to and the way it 's changing the way in which we um interact with the world it 's also changed the way which we behave as consumers you know this whole idea of instant gratification of needing things straight away and the stats really back that up you know in a fraction of a second is the amount of time it takes for someone to make a snap judgment on your website 74 of people are likely to switch brands if they find the purchasing process too difficult which says a lot about our loyalty and our brand loyalty these days if we don 't get things straight away we 're not going to buy from that person again 70 of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my two favorite stats eighty-two percent of consumers expect an immediate response to sales or marketing questions so people want answers straight away and 60 of customers prefer self-service over speaking to someone so we don 't just want answers straight away we don 't want to deal with people in order to get those answers which is really fascinating in terms of how technology has changed the way in which we interact with the world so what impact does this have on business what does this mean for business different customer service yeah in my situation yeah it 's changing the way in which we need to deliver our services right so technology is changing us and changing the way in which we consume things in the world if technology has changed the way in which we interact with the world then it makes sense that business also changes in line with that as well right and so there 's this thing called digital transformation and digital transformation is defined in a very simple way you know digital transformation is the integration of digital technology into all areas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers and i would actually argue that digital transformation is a lot broader than that digital transformation is so much bigger than that it 's not just about how you implement technology in the business it 's also about the human side of things really isn 't it if you think about digital transformation in a business it has a real human impact when you bring technology into a business it has an impact on the culture of the business the way in which we operate the way in which we run businesses you know if you bring technology in to improve efficiency and technology is changing really fast then equally so it 's important that you keep up with that that the culture within the business keeps up with those changes right so there 's this relationship between technology and the way in which we interact in business as well so it requires changes not just in business but in the way in which we run our businesses and we kind of saw this through covert would you agree in covert we learned very quickly that we could work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zoom and talk to people on zoom on a call sometimes with varying impacts as you might see here all the time the question is how do mosques just respond to those scandals and what would it mean for uh for the wider region i think one of your children just walked in let me shift it shifting shifting um shifting shifting sounds in the region do you think relationships [Music] what i love about that video is it illustrates perfectly the balance between technology and human right it 's uh we can have all the technology in the world but it 's how we use it and how we implement it that actually matters and you know despite everything you know there 's still those opportunities like that where things can happen that are outside of our control that are human experiences so when you think about bringing technology into a business it 's not just the technology it 's the impact on people that is something worth thinking about with covert what else did we see um we saw that it was okay to you know it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on into a trend where now businesses are starting to look at that as a permanent change right so we 're going from we 're always working from offices to now it 's completely okay to start looking at flexible work arrangements so we 're talking about an event that 's taking place where technology has enabled a permanent change to society and the way in which we interact yeah so i think that 's something really important to consider and the point i really want to make amongst all of this is the digital is really here to stay you know technology is here to stay i know sometimes i talk to business owners about how um you know they 're not really interested in improving the way in which the business operates they 're not interested in bringing technology into the business and i find that to be quite sad because it 's there isn 't a choice about it it 's happening whether you want to make that change or not so it 's not a case of thinking about if you 're going to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to do it and so i want to make sure that we 're on the same page regarding some common terms within the uh technology space so what i 'd like to do is define a few things with you if i was to ask you what is the cloud how would you define it yeah yeah storage the cloud it 's the cloud and outsourced yeah the cloud is simply a way to describe scalable on-demand services accessed over the internet right so when you hear things as being cloud-based it just means that it 's decentralized decentralized services centralized architecture right you don 't have a server in your office anymore it 's up in the cloud it 's a service that 's provided over the internet internet banking is an example of that sas what 's sas it 's not an attitude what 's sas software as a service yeah so sas is software as a service so it 's software that is cloud based that you generally pay a subscription fee for what 's an api this one 's really interesting because apis are almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to really maximize your use of technology within a business but i find that an api is typically not well understood it 's an application programming interface i was having a chat with my partner last night and asked her to define it for me and she defined in this really nice way she said it 's simply a socket right it 's like a power plug a socket in a power point right it 's a way to define how things like setting the standard by which uh things can talk to one another so an api is simply an app providing a standardized way to talk to it so that way you can pass information backwards and forwards and so what you 'd end up seeing is that you have different apps that have their own apis that then have the ability to connect and talk to one another what are cloud integrators or who are cloud integrators to an extent yeah we 're i 'm a cloud integrator some simply people who connect apps together so that they can all talk xero is a great example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days all have apis and can talk to other apps the trick is just figuring out how they talk and which ones talk legacy software yeah old systems and software that still perform as a role but could be replaced you know so quite often in businesses that have been around for 30 to 40 years i 'll have some software that 's been sitting there for a long time that hasn 't been replaced yet that is sitting on a server that could you know i think the last business i spoke to the license expired few years ago but it holds a lot of the information of the business right and so this particular system this business has 30 years worth of data right and so when i 'm talking about apps today i 'm not talking about apps on your mobile phone but that is a part of it specifically what i 'm talking about in what to use for your business are cloud-based software-as-a-service apps that have apis and can connect to other apps there are some stats around the changes to business that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 21 of businesses believe they 've completed their digital transformation journey and 71 of businesses are looking at multi-cloud architecture is the way in which they want to grow so multi-cloud platforms so we talk about cloud-based software service platforms 71 of businesses are looking at that as the way to grow and examples of that that you 'll see here in australia are zero the way in which mild is going as well being cloud-based and a lot of the tools that people use to run their businesses that you might be familiar with tools like these as an example i think there are about 32 logos on this page and in xeros at marketplace they have access to 800 apps that all connect so this is just a fraction of a fraction of what 's out there today and the growth of apps is really exponential so if there are all these apps out there in the marketplace and you 're looking to solve a particular problem for your business where do you start so imagine for a second that you 've just bought a cafe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bump bar they have an old-school printer a manual cash register they still do the cards that you need to get stamped in order to get buy 10 get one free and you 've just taken over this cafe and you 'd like to modernize it where do you begin yeah yeah i think the first thing the the way in which we work with businesses is and the first step that we always recommend is to understand the business understand what 's actually taking place in the business today you know quite often people start with the app first you know people will start with solving the problem straight away and you know i want to bring in square without a full understanding in terms of whether it 's applicable for the business so i 'd like to flip that way of thinking today with you and to challenge you to look at things and go well where is the business at today exactly how does it work and in understanding that what apps would then suit the needs of the business right there 's really three questions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do what does the business do the second one how do we do it you know how do we do what we do and the third one is what do we want to use an app for what do we want to do that we could use an app for right so there 's three separate ways in which you can look at business you can look at understanding the business and once you have that clear picture in terms of how the business works then you 've got the ability to start looking for apps that will solve those problems but until you identify the problems what are you solving all right so again this is the main challenge that i see with many businesses that they 'll start with the app they 'll start with the technology they 'll be just like your phones we when you have 140 apps installed they 'll start with the app first and then get to finding the one that solves the problem rather than starting with the problem and finding the app right so what i 'll walk you through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to understand the business to then find the app so the first thing you need to do is figure out what you do and one of the tools that we use for figuring out what a business does is a task audit a task audit is really simple it 's just a log of tasks of what someone does how long it took and it 's recorded over a period of time the reason why we usually start with a task orders for two reasons if you 're the only person in the business you probably have a good idea of everything you do but sometimes it might be automatic and you might not have thought about how long those things take or exactly the whole scope of everything you do within a business you know sometimes i 'll sit down with someone and i 'll say yeah so what do you do how do you work and they 're like i don 't know i just do so many things this is a managed way to be able to write down all those things and what benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yep yeah that 's exactly right you know you can have a look at the cost of that particular activity you know you can have a look at what 's taking up more time than it possibly should it can help you identify bottlenecks in the business it can help you understand where there might be opportunities to improve things using technology in some way so in this particular example with this task ordered you know five minutes opening the till checking the float and most of the time is spent ordering in points to sale processing payments but this is interesting 22 minutes printing and giving receipts to customers like there might be an opportunity there to have a digital system that emails the customer the receipt instead writing orders on the lid that 's probably wasted time and that still happens with a lot of cafes but there might be an opportunity there to have the point of sale system integrated with a digital display that acts as a digital bump bar within the cafe and then passing a lid along to the barista so you can start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly what 's going on in the business the what of the business and if you have a team this is even more important as an activity to do so if you have an accountant if you have a whole lot of people in operations a salesperson you know it 's really important to understand everything that they do because if you bring in a system or an app to be able to change the changes how they work it 's really important to understand the impact of those changes right um change management is probably the it is the biggest piece of an implementation of new technology right helping train the people to say hey this is how your job did work and this is how it works now right so this helps you understand really quickly and easily the impact of any changes you bring in with any apps that you bring in so in front of you you 've got some sheets and it gives an example of a task audit what i 'd like you to do is spend a couple of minutes just writing your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here it 's really interesting going through this process because it 's quite easy to get sucked into too much detail the real trick is keeping it detailed enough to give you valuable information to make decisions but broad enough to not take three hours to complete and as a side note as an activity this is worthwhile doing regardless of whether you 're looking to bring in technology or not because it helps you understand what 's taking place in the business at the moment would anyone like to volunteer to run through their list against that sure so the type is what up in the morning shower the day is today 10 15 minutes then get dressed that make up another 10 minutes coffee did anyone have the same tasks or similar tasks similar same pretty much at different times probably the point i want to make here is that sometimes it 's easy to talk to peers in industry right about apps that they use and things they use and things that they do and quite often in industry people do things in similar ways but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a business isn 't always the same so this is an activity just helps flag those areas where you do things a little bit differently than other people those things that you do a little bit different than other people and again especially important if you have larger teams and you want to get an understanding in terms of the impact of bringing technology on those people and also to see to get an understanding as to what they do so once you understand what you do in the business the next question is how do you do it right so the second tool i 'd like to share with you here is doing a process map again quite a lo-fi tool a process map simply shows and maps out a workflow you know it 's a series of steps and activities along the way from a set starting point to an end point in this particular example um it 's a little bit more complicated because i 've showed the inter interactions between two different people so the customer and the cashier but a process map in essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things work in a business so there 's a couple of different symbols that get used uh quite commonly you 've got this little shape here this pill which represents the start or end of an activity so you 've seen one at the start one at the end you 've got these rectangles here which indicate an activity you 've got the diamonds here which which indicate a decision a choice or a decision right and then you 've got the arrows the point of the flow so it 's a really simple tool to map out and it 's one that you can do to map out any sort of process that you 're looking to understand right with their cafe example some processes that they might want to map out might include um how to make a coffee or how the sales process works when someone first arrives what other examples could there be within the cafe example of processes they might want to map out if they ordered food as well what happens there what happens yeah regular customer discount yeah yeah there 's all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what i do recommend if you 're going to do a process map is to focus on the processes that can be automated or you 're looking to automate or looking to use technology to do or manage the reason why i say that is like in the cafe example there 's probably no point in mapping out the process for making a coffee unless they 're going to replace the barista with a robot right that 's the only scenario where it makes sense to understand how that process works continuity of service quality yeah yeah that 's right yeah but in the case of bringing technology yeah yeah but yeah understanding the processes helps as you say uh improve the quality of the services and maintain consistency as well but this is a really good way of understanding how you do something right and so on the sheets there you 've also got an example of how i make my coffee and i 'm sure yours will be a little bit different right so much like uh we all do the tasks in slightly different ways even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different ways right and again the point here is that if you go through this process of understanding your business and operates you can then pick up the little nuances and how it would differ when you 're using digital tools now really low-fi way of doing this process and the one that i tend to use just to use post-it so if you 're going to map something out throw it throw up some post-its up somewhere you can move them around you can shuffle them it 's a really neat way to get a quick understanding as to how something works so this is my coffee process done with post-its and the last tool is to figure out what you want to do and one way in which you can figure out what you want to do is through a tool called user stories which comes from software development user store stories are really simple it 's just a statement as a something i want something so that so as a manager i want to approve all expenses over five thousand dollars so i can control cash flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all transactions so context is there for our accountant as a customer at a cafe i want to be able to pay straight away using my phone so that i can get out of there really quickly also i don 't need a carry change you know what to be another example for the cafe as a user story that 's a great one yeah want to call in my order what else yeah you you want as a customer you want the uh the coffee shop to remember your order so once you get an understanding for those three things right you can smoosh them all together you know you 've got this list of tasks of what takes place in the business you 've got the processes that take place and you 've got what you want to be able to achieve and you can put them all together to create yourself a shopping list right of all the things that you want to be able to do or you want an app to be able to do so in this particular case we 've got process sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitality specific for the cafe we want it to run on an ipad we want to accept cards or payments on mobiles you can put all of those things together into a requirements list and that becomes your shopping list when you 're out looking for different apps so to sort of summarize that in a different way by first understanding what the business does what you do and how you do it and looking at what you want to be able to do you can then combine that into one single list or one list of requirements to then compare what the different apps do as a way to go and find apps that meet those needs and you can find out which apps meet those needs as well as which ones don 't and exactly what they don 't need and there 's two non-negotiables you want apps that talk to your accounting platform and also cloud-based so the question is where do you start to find apps you 've got your shopping list where do you go to find apps app store yep like businesses find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accounting platforms most accounting platforms that have apis have large marketplaces of apps that connect to it i always like starting with the accounting platform because everyone needs one uh like it 's central to every single business and they all interact with different apps in different ways and they integrate in different ways so there 's different depths of the way in which they connect to one another and so you can go to their marketplaces a bit like the app store for for business apps and search for apps that meet particular needs now this is xero 's version of their marketplace and you can search for apps by industry you can search for apps by task so what 's the problem you 're looking to solve what are you looking to achieve and then it 'll help filter out apps that integrate with xero that fit that particular need and then you can look at that app test it out compare it against your shopping list see whether it meets your needs or not other places you can look business associations speak to industry groups about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apps that they recommend for lawyers they have an approved list um social media i see a lot of people asking for recommendations on social media about apps uh steer clear of that one because quite often people recommend the app first rather than understanding the business first right which is not what we want you can ask peers so you can go to another coffee shop and ask what they use telegram yeah so i stuck my head over the counter had a look at what they use and they 're using square so so it 's very easy to to ask people to have a look at what other people use you know so have a look at peers and ask peers what they use and how they find it you could look on comparison sites xero 's marketplace for example but captain g2 give rundowns and reviews of different apps you can talk to people like me cloud integrators you can google things how do i automate accounts payable and i 'll come up with a whole list of apps that you can have a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a list of apps that you 've shortlisted the next step is then to go talk to those app providers you know there are several things you want to find out you want to find out can i do what you want you 've got your shopping list of all the things you want it to do so talk to that provider find out kind of do what you want you can find that out from their website as well a lot of the time you know they 'll have their features there and what they can do it 's really important to ask what can 't it do well as well you know most i find most app providers will tell you everything that it does well but they won 't always tell you what it can 't do well but it 's important to find out what doesn 't it do what does it connect to and if you 're looking to make the most out of implementing technology in your business it 's important to make sure that every single app you bring into the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an example if you have xero is your accounting platform and you want a way to be able to take photos of receipts and have them flow automatically into the accounts you could look at dext right because they talk to one another you can automate it so dex fits the particular need zero fits a particular need but the real power comes from connecting them together you want to find out what their setup and implement implementation steps are so how do they get set up do they help you with that process or do you do that yourself sometimes with some apps they 'll help you sometimes they 'll make you do all the work yourself um and that might be a little bit complicated so it 's worthwhile asking the question it 's also worthwhile asking about pricing and hidden costs so most apps cloud-based apps have a subscription that they charge some of them have other other fees that they charge as well like some will charge a setup cost some will have extra functionality that you need to unlock kind of like a freemium kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware because you can get stung quite quickly when you make a decision to implement an app based on the cost but then the cost is actually a lot higher once you start enabling the functionality that you want right so these are some of the questions to ask so other things you know that often don 't get asked that are really important to ask and these are the questions that we go after when we 're talking to app providers that i really want to share with you because this is where people get caught out you want to find out how does it connect right which is a different question to whether it connects right having two apps that connect is great but they don 't always you know not all connections are equal you know some apps connect natively and by a native integration i mean that they connect to each other and they have a direct connection to each other some you need to use a third-party tool and so it 's not a direct integration or you have some other plugin that you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one system to another that how is really important because it changes things and how also changes in terms of what information gets pushed in and out of different systems so it 's really it 's worthwhile understanding look i have this particular app and this particular app asking the people well how do they connect you know when i add uh as an example within xero and dext or another example zero and arrow flow arrow flow 's a job management system if i create a new invoice in arrow flow does it push it into my accounts and if i mark it as paid in my accounts does it update that in arrow flow some apps do some apps don 't you know so you can go in thinking that it 's a two-way integration that they talk both ways but they may not so whether it 's a one-way sink or a two-way sink so which which direction does it go in is really important to ask so the nature of the connection is probably the key thing to ask any app provider when you 're looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you whether you 're going to be saving time or whether you 're going to have some manual processes some human processes to keep two systems aligned where is my data stored you know really important to ask and how can you access it so if you were to close down the app and not use it anymore how can you access that information does it work on all devices there 's a very popular cloud-based legal system for trust accounting within law that they tell people that it works on macs but what i mean by that is that you need to install a windows emulator on the mac to run the windows software on the mac and that 's how it runs on macs right so yeah it doesn 't work on all devices really important question and there 's another system for job management as well that doesn 't work on i think it doesn 't work on android only works on iphone and you look at the percentage of people that have android devices and the last one what 's the roadmap app has developers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time right and you might find that an app will do 80 of what you want and you might ask them saying look what are your plans to develop this is this is this on your roadmap or not is it something you 're planning on doing because sometimes it is and sometimes it isn 't and that might be the difference between making a decision between this app and that app right so so again you 've got your shopping list you 've ticked things all off and there are things that they can and can 't do today and it 's also important to know what things they might be able to do into the future that fits that that ticks that box for you right so what is the roadmap and the last way to get an understanding in terms of whether an app is the right app for you is to ask for a demo you know quite often they 'll have trials you can set it up you can put your own data in you can test out your processes in that app and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need sometimes they don 't provide a demo that you can set up or a trial that you can set up sometimes they 'll just show you if they show you just make sure that you ask them to show you how your process works in their system so again you have your shopping list of things that you want to be able to see and do really important that you ask to see how that would work in their app because again most salespeople will tell you that they can do everything that app can do everything you ever need but when they show you how it actually works you might find that it 's 15 clicks to be able to do that thing or it 's a little bit complex to do or convoluted so it 's really important to ask people look just show me how it works and above all what you 're looking for from all of this are apps that are cloud-based that are easy to use that are simple to implement right because you 've got to remember that at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to help people right so on your list on your shopping list one of the other things you might want to add in there as a non-negotiable is that it 's easy to use so once you start bringing it all together you start getting a picture in terms of the different problems you 're looking to solve and the different apps you could use to solve those problems you know four hour cafe as an example you know they might use zero for their accounting to look after that because they realize that they have accounting that they need to do within the business they need to do rostering as part of part of the business to make sure people are managed in timesheets and so they 've decided to choose deputy for this using square for their point of sales and to take payments to be able to manage the different cut the customers as they come in the sales and the sales get pushed into the accounts and they 're using decks for managing their own bills so they can just take a photo of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well and because they 've done their research they know that all these systems talk to one another they all integrate so it saves a lot of their time so we 're talking about this idea of digital transformation this is really the end point of what it 's all about and that particular stat that i had around multi-cloud 70 70 of businesses are moving towards multi-cloud cloud-based software cloud-based software cloud-based software that 's what i mean by multi-cloud different platforms that solve different problems within a business that all connect so really we 've covered off today a couple of things you know we started with looking at the idea that it 's not about finding the apps it 's having a managed way to find the right apps for your business ones that solve the problems that you 're looking to solve right we saw that with the mobile phones the number of apps we have and the number we actually use we discussed digital transformation and the trend towards the way in which technology is changing our lives and the importance of making sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it we looked at a managed way to be able to understand your business first rather than finding the app first which is the mistake that a lot of people make when looking for apps as they start with the app and start with a problem rather than taking a step back and looking at the whole business right so the biggest tips the biggest tip that i can have for you today is to understand the business first find which apps do exactly what you need and get them to show you how it works and the last tip is keep it really small much like with the phones where we have lot of apps that we don 't use you know you want to keep it really small you want to use as few apps as possible within your business because then you 're more likely to use them you 're more likely to have your people in your business use them as well there 's less to train people on so find the apps to do what you need and as much as possible keep that footprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apps at the moment that you think are going to be killer apps the ones that i 'm interested in the moment are more around automation and it 's automation combined with artificial intelligence so there are the ones that are really interesting at the moment there 's a an example is that say receipts right as a simple example within the accounting accounting world you know there are apps that allow you to take a photo that pulls the data out using optical character recognition and then pushes that into the accounts right yeah dex is an example the the interesting thing is how they can more intelligently determine what 's happening in the accounts um so understanding that a receipt has already gone in so i don 't need to push this one in that you know obviously you 've already reconciled that account so i 'm just going to attach this instead like that stuff is is really interesting at the moment in terms of that that deeper integration of how technology has been used to reduce that manual process that 's taking place multi-item receipt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every line yeah i mean that 's that 's already exists um yeah dex does that and it 's not just receipts right but any sort of physical document because you can get um there are other systems you can use another technology like robotic process automation where you can take uh something that a person would normally do and start automating that so one of the things i 'm looking at the moment is how to make it easier for our team to pull down reports from government portals by using a robot to do that instead because it 's just there 's no value in us doing that work ourselves if it 's just a log in go here click here train a robot to do it instead so robotic process automation is a big trend and also some of these ai driven decision support systems are also becoming more of a thing as well so uh i 'm at a branding agency one of the very long processes that we have is like the sales process in terms of invoicing and agreements right now it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 're already trying to explore trying to find because there 's multiple softwares that we 're already using together yeah um zero you know adobe um any of the adobe suites because we 've got the and then some of these details and then have it go across from the agreement to the invoice and have it all automated all the way through from the first payment through the last payment yeah so we just do it once rather than having to manually do it but i can 't find anything that does that i don 't say having to write something ourselves it 's very custom built have a look at um have a look at practice condition like that 's that 's for the accounting industry but it handles it the the question there will be whether practice ignition built for the account industry it handles the agreement step through to invoicing um and can do you know people can get an agreement have optional add-ons as well if they want to choose but that whether that 'll work for you depends on whether you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own platform to do that because of that exact thing because everyone erin was the solution was it yeah"

    "text": "thank you um we 're here to talk about business strategies so there 's lots of academic definitions around business strategy the general consensus is when we 're talking about business strategy what we 're talking about is creating val or value creation so the competitive advantage that you 're creating in your business and we 're going to use a specific talk it 's a condensing strategy into almost under an hour today so we 're using a specific tool to do that we 're going to use the business model canvas which you can actually see there in front of you but the value in this one pager is understanding your value proposition which i 'll expand on more today this can be a simple tick box exercise where you go home in five minutes and fill out all the blocks and you file it away and it 's done but the value in this exercise is being really clear about what your value proposition is what is it that you bring that your customers need what is it that they want and how are all the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to go through how do they actually support that value proposition so what are you doing to strengthen it in the eyes of the consumer so what are we going to go through we 're going to set the scene with a little bit of talking about what 2020 taught us so what did we learn from last year and as a result of what we learned what has now become that new catchphrase that we 're hearing a lot of the new normal so what does the new normal look like for us as business owners in in wa and in perth particularly and as i 've already mentioned we 're going to use a particular tool when we talk about the business the business model canvas today so what 2020 taught us ah socrates it 's a classic good greek philosopher quote um the secret of change is to focus all of your energy not on fighting the old but on building the new so we are going through a change management process for a lot of us because what 2020 did is it exposed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll talk about that in a bit more detail and it opened it up actually to a whole new world of possibility a new way of doing business so we are going through a change management process um if you want to do a little bit of reading codder is a great management philosopher as such on on change management he talks about eight steps to change one of those first ones being making sure that you gather a team around you who understand your vision for your change and then working through a strategic plan process so making sure that that change has a plan so again a useful reason to working through the business model canvas so covert what did it how did it shape us well the first thing is that risk contingency or contingency plans are no longer a nice thing that we might have in the that we might want to think about getting to one day contingency planning for us has now become a must so if you think about you know if you might have risk managed yourself in businesses that you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your risk management strategy and often one of the tools we do with risk management is we allocate you know a likelihood of risk and then an impact the pan a pandemic kind of sat in that small business small area of the quadrant that no one really thought about it was highly unlikely to occur but if it was going to occur it was going to have a large impact and then what it taught us what coverage is that even the smallest businesses were suddenly impacted most dramatically so this is not just risk management 's not just for big corporates to undertake so we have this requirement now to risk and crisis management and some of us have become very good at it so it 's a great it 's one of the good things that have come out of it there is no doubt that flexing and remote work is here to stay at one point one third of the words workforce was working at home throughout covert and for many of other countries around the world they still have people at home i 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from working from home so there is no longer this expectation that this kind of dynamic where employers yourself as employers potentially have to just sort of work with people that want to work with home it 's become an expectation for many people now moving forward to two days a week from home maybe not for those of you in non-operational roles may be something that people expect certainly cloud technology has been fast forwarded in lots of industries so things like telehealth for example have been on the horizon for a while the ability to talk to your doctor face to face to not having to go into the appointment but seeing them over the phone was something we were talking about by 2025 it 's been fast track considerably so tech cloud technology is here to stay and many people have now found a way to adapt and work with it or have adapted new cloud strategies which then or new technologies that they 're now working with the biggest one for me with covert it held a mirror up to the constraints of our key business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key business activities the things that we that drive our revenue were significantly held back or constrained and most frustratingly in ways that we had no control so this is where the business model canvas will be a good tool for us to talk about those particular revenue streams and the mapping moving forward obviously things like employee engagement and health have always been a priority but they certainly moved up the priority list you know if we think about big corporates who had global teams of people who were working from home they had to then find ways to create global communities for us smaller businesses who had perhaps staff we had to find ways to continually check in and see how they were going and obviously not just from an engagement perspective from a mental health perspective because for some working from home has been quite challenging those that did well in covert were those that communicated clearly to their stakeholders and the communication wasn 't just about building a sales pipeline as communication can often be it was about establishing trust so about being able to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams you could not you can 't gut manage for a long period sustainably in a period of extended crisis so certainly the real the need for real data has arisen so for many of us we had to make snap decisions find ways to pivot and change what we do but we can 't continue to do that we need to find data measurements to make sure that our assumptions are grounded so what i 'm talk what i 'm talking about here is for some of us we had geographic assumptions about our customer base where they came from and some of those assumptions were tested quite heavily in cloven when that when that customer face interaction was taken away from us so it became for some our gut assumptions may have been correct about where our customers came from but to move forward what we need to do is then make sure we 've got some real data around that so we can make make some real strategic decisions and most importantly for i think the the customer focus on what customers want in the way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over covert because ironically although for many of us our cus the customer face-to-face interaction was taken away from us customers actually wanted more interaction more than ever so finding a way to manage that and be customer facing in your business strategy which is what this tool is about is is extremely important moving forward so the the new normal i guess has been spoken about in terms of navigating the rough seas so if covert was the perfect storm it 's it 's now a period of sustained change and sustained uncertainty because we are still in a period of sustained uncertainty so the business model canvas what it offers us is a plan for meeting your customers needs so it 's an enduring model this might be something that we looked at to look to undertake in a crisis but it 's about an ongoing strategy that we can you continue to adopt and evolve in any future so what is life like for us now well we know that hotel quarantine is going to continue to be a state issue despite the state particularly of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way this is just a comment on the political um the political environment as we know it now uh particular our own premier has continually asked for an issue a solution to hotel quarantine is because it is one of our biggest risk factors but however it will be a state issue um and it 's likely to not be moved out of the city so it is an ongoing threat for us even though the threat will be minimised as we talk about vaccine rollout in a minute we know that there 's an election coming up in march and traditionally traditionally leaders coming into elections like to make sure that they don 't expose themselves to risk so they tend to behave very conservatively so we 've got those two factors play coming into play we 've seen the local lockdowns and that seems to be what 's happening in australia from a management perspective we seem to be seeing local lockdowns now as the movement forward with managing covert to create that what they call the circuit breaker which has been another term that 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ongoing snap lockdowns um and what we 're seeing is the opportunity in that is that we don 't we don 't necessarily have a national lockdown so interruption to supply chain that 's across across states but we 're likely to see localised responses to covert in australia which is therefore going to continue to contribute to that international and border domestic uncertainty however wa does have a booming resources sector we have got a budget surplus we are in a position of an unemployment rate that is now at about six point two percent we do see growing consumer confidence and was in particular particularly a pretty good position and so we have a resilient small business industry or small business sector here um we know the vaccine is being rolled out at start of this week uh there is no data as yet obviously but there is predictions that we 're going to see simply by its existence about a four percent growth in consumer confidence as a result simply because we know it 's here but we do have to be aware that most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling that to phase two to a two b okay and we don 't really know when the time frames of that is we haven 't been given any time frames they 're sort of just saying by year end so it 's not an immediate solution for us it 's before we get wide community um take up of the vaccine it 's going to be a small period it 's a period of time in front of us so we do have to think about this ongoing management of these top two issues feeding into local lockdowns as potentially an opportun a possibility so what else do we know we know that in 2020 for some of us revenue turn off revenue was like a tap turning off and it was a tap we had no control over for some of us some of our revenue streams were completely stopped for others it was uh perhaps one and perhaps it was our main feeder of revenue so we had to find other ways we had i urge you now if you haven 't done the work on understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact that perhaps the covert had now is the time now is the time what revenue streams were hit hardest what have you done to adjust and move forward with that and what are the lessons that you 've learned certainly at this point in time there is really no excuses for not knowing your costs because what the opportunity that came out of last year was all of us as business owners had to undertake a massive business reset so in times of crisis what do you do when you plumb the tap the first thing you do is you look at your costs and we had to go through that process of massive cost adjustment many of us so at this point we have we should have taken those learnings and we should be now implementing in our business so understanding what our fixed costs are what our variable costs are being really clear about the impacts that each how the revenue aligns to those costs and we 're going to talk about that a little bit more in the business model canvas model as well we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the pandemic it was one of the federal government 's most um i guess dramatic uh responses to the pandemic though having said that by december this year last year only about 16 of wa businesses were still accessing job keeper according to the ato so we are in a pretty resilient business market here as i said said in wa and also we obviously don 't haven 't had the impact of perhaps some of the other states like victoria have seen so that has allowed us to be a little bit more um i guess a little bit more opportunistic moving forward for some of you you might have staff on job keeper you 'll understand that they 're being paid at this um this two-tier arrangement at the moment um we 're in this second sort of second final second phase of job keeper that moves into final completion from march 28th tier one if they 're working 80 plus hours of fortnight the allowance is a thousand dollars tier two is 650 but we are very aware and very clear that it will stop from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal government at all that they will continue in any way shape or form apart from perhaps con in increasing the job seeker amount by a minimal amount per 0.49 it 's likely what we 're assuming that we will see is state responses so things like after lockdowns the the responsibility on the state to perhaps find a way to reconsent um compensate businesses in some way so what should we be doing now if we 're thinking about job keeper finishing we certainly there is a need to refit your business cost base so for so cash flow planning is king over this particular period or one of the most important business financial management strategies that you can be undertaking where you 're actually physically planning the cash moving out of your business bank balance over the next three month period so what does cash flow look like at the moment for you if you 're under if you 've got job keeper and what is it going to look like at the end of march 20 at the end of the month what 's it going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 've seen plenty of businesses over this period who are using job keeper as a as a revenue stream that is a reality so if you but we have to be really clear about what the wage budget for post march 28th is going to look like and plan for it with a conservative outlook it 's best to be conservative when we 're cash flow forecasting so plan for a conservative revenue outlook if all things stay the same if we 're not seeing revenue growth what does my wage budget look like therefore what is the cash flowing in my into my business bank account and the cash flowing out of my business bank account look like make sure you 're talking to your employees about any changes so being upfront communication is key here and for full-time staff if you have them and you and you have done your cash flow forecasting and you 're simply aware that you can 't continue to maintain them make sure that you 're aware of the fair work act and the stand down provisions if you 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot call fair work work through the issues there is a job maker hiring credit that will be available so if you are hiring staff and i think it 's about a 250 allowance from memory if you if you 're eligible if you 're an eligible business and your staff fall within a particular age range so i 've spoke to spoken about the ongoing change that we 're seeing and the fact that we are in this period of continued continued uncertainty what can we do to create a sustainable plan for ongoing change well there 's some key questions we need to ask ourselves we need to know who we are as a business and we 'll talk about value proposition in a minute we need to know what our clients need and most importantly we need to know what we call the value drivers why do they buy from you what do you what do your clients need why do they buy from you and this is often with business owners we can make an assumption about this so if you 're not um rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out what 's made your clients choose you over others i have a and a client that i 've worked with for a very long time and they they 're a legacy business they 've been they 're one of purse oldest businesses they 've been around for a long time and when i first started working with them we spoke about their value drivers they 're almost a bit embarrassed about that they kind of called themselves the dinosaur in the industry but when talking to the clients what we actually found is their professionalism their knowledge their length of time they 'd been in business was one of the key reasons that clients actually chose them so we started to flip the internal dialogue about that and also started to make sure that our marketing was forward-facing about that becoming proud of who we were in terms of our legacy and what it is we offer because that was the reason clients were choosing them know what path to take so we 're going to talk a lot about the different choices that you can make and knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opportunity because it 's shine a light as i 've said on our revenue streams and what ones we 're constrained by so now we can make some clear choices about the rest best revenue we can chase in our business what can we when i talk about know what default i 'm talking about is there some unsustainable revenue in our business that we actually possibly need to stop resourcing with key activities and stop resourcing with costs and find alternative and perhaps need to fold it or move it on and perhaps find other revenue streams to acquire is there things that over clover we 've actually uncovered that have been extremely successful for us in terms of revenue so how are we resourcing that how are we supporting that this is where the business model kansas comes into play so it 's an enduring model as i 've said for understanding your competitive business position what it is that you do differently from your competitors what is it that you do better than anybody else how are you articulating that to your client base so business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creates delivers captures value how do you create value how do you deliver value how do you capture it and you 've already got the piece of paper in front of you this particular model uses nine building blocks basically they 're nine building blocks for um to help you make money in your business but the um we don 't actually work through it from left to right so the key with this model is it actually we actually work through it a particular way we actually start if you 're to fill this out you actually start with understanding your customers and then we work on the value because by understanding their customers why do they buy from us what do they need we can then be clear about articulating that in our value proposition we then talk about our channels so how are we reaching our customers how are we getting in front of them what is the relationship we 're having with them and how is that being articulated into revenue what are the key resources that we need to support the revenue one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the who are the key partners and what are the cost structures we 've got in place to support all of this so if you think about it if we actually drew a line down the center this side is actually about the cost in your business this sides are about the efficiencies in your business this side is about value creation so moving through these nine basic blocks the nine basic blocks that are going to make money in your business number one the first one customer segments the key questions that you are asking do you know all your customers needs do you reach them all in the same way who are you creating value for and if you 've got different customer segments and you 're going that is you 've got different need you 've got customers with different needs if you 've got customers that you reach with different distribution channels if you 've got customers that buy differing products and service services then you 're going to have more than one customer segment another way of looking that is the ideal client model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing so what we 're talking about is the old target market conversation is now moving into defining who your ideal customers are so perhaps no more than three if you 've got more than three you 're probably not being definite enough you 're going to service more than three types of customers but we are talking about the best ones for you the ones that buy from you because they value what you do and often when we see a target market description of your customers we see this demographic kind of information that pops up so how old are they are they a particular gender do they live in a certain area are they married what do they like to do and the reason that we 're doing that is we 're trying to build a picture of what our customer looks like the important questions for me are these ones what do they fear and what are they value so this is a real deep dive into your customers being really clear about what keeps them awake at night because are you solving that problem for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value what is it that they actually what is it that they think feels important to them because that makes sure that when you 're asking that question you 're sure that the needs that you meet align with those values the reason that we build this picture in this way is so that we can ask these questions these marketing questions because we want to make sure marketing can be like shooting arrows into the air right we want to make sure that our marketing is targeted how do we make sure our marketing is targeted the message has to be clear so the message for the message to be clear to get cut through in this highly competitive market space it needs to ensure that it answers these questions or it lets the customer know that you 've got something that solves their problems you 've got something that they value you 've got something that they need and then it will go into the the questions around promotional activities how will you best reap them meet them how might they resist so building these profiles extremely important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ideal clients are we then move into the value proposition section of the business model canvas so that again that 's the things i 've raised with why do your customers buy from you what problems are you solving what needs are you meeting and i challenge you when you do this particular exercise it 's often easy to rely on the tried and true things we 've heard before so my value proposition is i offer superior customer service or my my product is simply is off delivers at a higher rate or more efficiently than my competitors to get real value to use that word to get real value out of this tool really make sure that you 're articulating and diving into that clearly so don 't just say custom and it 's okay to hang your hat on customer service it absolutely is but make sure that you 're unpacking what that customer service looks like and we 'll talk about when we get to channels in a minute we 'll talk about that a little bit more so is it in line with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're when you do saying that you do something better than your competitors or more efficiently in what way what is it that makes it more efficient so being really clear about the value proposition so that when you work through all the building blocks you make sure that any of those activities support the value proposition so you 're working together it might be that your value propositions are around design or brand so you might be a high-end product that 's around stat that 's around status and loyalty it might be that your value proposition 's around accessibility you can shoot and we 'll talk about core competencies in a minute but being really clear about why your customers buy from you so channels how do you reach your customers currently is it direct are you a direct business so is it website is it do you have a sales team or is it that it 's more indirect so are you using a third-party provider are you a wholesaler how do your customers want to be reached remember the key to this is making sure it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the customer and you 're ensuring that any one of these building blocks support the value proposition support that you 're doing what you say that you will do and covert has had an opportunity to actually open up a lot of these questions because this is probably the building block that got the most disrupted throughout covert what of our distribution channels actually work what do we have to do if one of those channels is completely cut off from us what ones cost the latest amount of money to actually service what ones provide the most amount of money what are the most efficient how do they integrate and talk to each other is there a way that i can maximize that integration so if i 'm a retail store and i 've got online and bricks and mortar walk-in customers how would those two integrate how do i convert one from the other how do i build a community around both of those groups of people if you 've introducing new channel just new channels or new ways of reaching your customers and some for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that just make sure again going back to the value proposition that your after sales service that your follow-up is in line with the value proposition so it 's in line with what you 're saying that you 're going to do customer relationships for me this is the most this is a key question and if i think about if i talk about business strategy sometimes i think we get caught up in the word strategic plan so we might hire a consultant or we think oh no the strategic planning is just too big i don 't have the time because we think about the fact that we need to get our mission and our values uh sorted and then we have to write a whole heap of initiatives and we have to tie a budget to all of those and then we just undertake the initiatives that cost us the least amount of money whereas and by doing that often we and then we lose the this question how do i get customers how do i keep them how do i grow them for me they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what relationships you develop your customers what type of wonder they actually expect and relationships can be personal so you can be at the show at the luxury end it 's sort of that one-to-one highly specialized personalized type you know if we 're talking butler type service or personalized shopping it can be automatic so netflix because of its algorithm tells me it tells me what it is that i should watch it 's a serve that 's the service it 's providing me coals with its click and collect allows me to look at previous orders so therefore it 's easy it 's simplified and it 's easy so it can be automated it can be what one-to-one how are your relationships working um we 're finding now that communications and groups so building communities is a lot of the way that we 're generating customer relationships kmart has a whole facebook page that 's about a retail hacks for people to organize their homes so we 're all recondoling our homes now and we 're trying to organize them kmart has nothing to do with this with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've bought to help organize their home it 's generating a community which is then driving sales apple doesn 't do much of its own maintenance and service issues anymore it relies on the community so people just type into the website i can 't get this to work and other apple users help them so there 's a variety of different ways that we can think about the customer relationship how are we building communities is it one-to-one is it automated revenue streams what are my customers paying currently but what are they actually willing to pay so if i 've been really clear about what they value have i done any work on exposing what it is that they 're actually willing to pay am i forcing to pay in a way they actually don 't want to what would they prefer to do is there some way that i can reduce or make the process more efficient is there some online or some sort of model that way that i can move is my revenue recurring is it time based what fits my value proposition constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've written the answers to these questions go back and say does this fit with my value proposition does this fit with what my customers want and need does it enhance or what it is that i said that i would do and what does it say that i who i am making sure you 're doing an efficiency analysis so as i said to you earlier now that you understand your costs and you 've got a really clear grasp of your costs and where they come from align them to your revenue streams be really clear about their revenue streams of the most efficient for you the ones that are generating you the highest margins and have a think about what you 're doing about the lowest margins one are they are your revenue streams sustainable as i said do you have strong margins on all of them do you collect revenues before you incur expenses so how does your order what we call the order to pay process work and often if we 're talking to business owners sometimes what we find is there is a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or doing the work for the customer and the final invoicing process so is there a whole lot of inefficiencies in my order to pay process that i actually need to streamline so that i can then service the customer better but create a more efficient revenue stream for me and particularly for cash flow planning obviously we often talk a lot about time lag if you 're a business at invoices on terms the time lag between the cut the invoice being sent after you 've done the work so for some of us in small business we actually get caught up in the day-to-day and we we lag on invoicing and then we lag on the the chasing and then the payment 's late and we can often find it 60 days after we 've actually done the work that we 're being paid for the work and that 's where cash flow drain becomes a problem so being clear about those things understanding your customers needs that 's why those first two questions around customer pro customer segments and value proposition are important to get right because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for is there an unmet need in your offering that you could actually be focusing on or cons or working towards um in the times in the times of covert what we found is we found businesses that did move and abruptly and shift quickly there were florists that started delivering that fruit and vegetable packs there were agricultural businesses that started doing face marks there were those that started producing hand sanitizer because they had the supply chain to be able to do that easily and quickly what infrastructure do i have that others need it 's not it 's just because we 're not first to market and life beyond covert has moved on doesn 't mean there 's not opportunities there still there are enduring now services or resources that people will need ongoing access to so do i have a supply chain that replicates any of those what 's in demand now i can learn from the lessons of those that have perhaps gone for for me so that you don 't always have to be a first mover in this marketplace to have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this question continually how are you creating capturing delivering values so block six talks about either the human resources that i have so am i a strongly knowledge based business or it talks about perhaps the ip that i have or the actual physical hardware that i 've got computers cars whatever that hardware is is it is it all cap crating capturing delivering value does it make sense does it align with my value proposition does it meet the needs that help me meet the needs of my customers if you don 't have some key resources that you 've identified based on your value proposition how are you going to go out and acquire them have you got some perhaps resources that you that were internal and therefore you 've found that you have value in outsourcing so again that 's that that question around do i have things that are difficult to replicate anything that 's difficult to replicate is it can help to drive my competitive advantage so do i have resources that are difficult to replicate and therefore support the value proposition key activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i said i would deliver what do i actually need that will help me enhance the value proposition what am i actually doing in terms of production process or production activities are actually getting in the way of supporting the value proposition so again that 's in-house versus outsource for some of us over covered we actually found that there was an opportunity to outsource um a lot of what we did and that 's an on that therefore has become something that we 're going to continue to do moving forward for others it meant having to pull activities back in so something they previously might have outsourced they 're now pulling back in-house based on how you 've carved out your value proposition again if i go back to that superior customer customer service model does for an example an outsourced va work for you or some sort of remote based telephone service for some businesses it does for some it doesn 't because it doesn 't align with the value proposition so making sure that each of these building blocks support your value proposition support what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key partnerships so just as an aside um business activity that any business owner can do whether you 're a sole trader or whether you 're a large corporate every now and then sit down and write sit down and write 10 people that are in your referral network so who can i rely on to become an ambassador for my business now they might be people that you know i 'm not talking about friends and friends and family here by the way i 'm talking about perhaps people that are in so aligned industries people that you may have heard of that you get to meet but you want to meet who can help you grow and develop your business who can become ambassadors for your business find a way to get in front of them and meet with them to tell them about what it is that you 're doing is it making sure that you 've got a meeting set up is that simply having a coffee with someone so that you can continue to talk about your business so that you can continue to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others about your business the example i always use is the strategic alliance of the real estate agent the mortgage broker and the finance specialist they 've all got the same client the same client just has different needs at different times so often you 'll find them working together they 'll create a strategic partnership so who can you create a strategic partnership with who are your suppliers over the over covered what we 've found is that we 've had to again it 's communication with these key suppliers that have really come to the forefront we 've had to find ways in periods of snap log down to work with our suppliers perhaps we 've got stock that suddenly had to be put on hold that can 't be delivered we 've got massive supply supply chain disruption for some of us who has who have stock that 's coming from overseas that 's been sitting on docks we have things that require a redeployment of supply of our supply so who are our key suppliers what are we doing to ensure that we are continually working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you actually need to go out and meet to continue to service that value proposition and i says i 've already identified a few times now what can you outsource the last building block talks about cost centres now for some of you you come from a cost based business so therefore cost centers are going to be extremely important more important than perhaps so the value-based businesses for some of you your value-based businesses customer experience personalized route service is going to be a greater need than perhaps cost centers however we all need to concentrate on our costs regardless of what business model we 're operating what covert has shown us is there are some costs that protect potentially aren 't actually inherent to our business model we 've got resources that are expensive more expensive than others of the key resources that we 've identified that support the value proposition which ones are the most expensive what key activities are the most expensive so remembering you 've worked through this now and you 've worked through what your key activities that is the production activities that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most what cost you the least and it 's okay you 're going to have ones that cost you the most and cost you the least but it 's about understanding the efficiencies being clear about that you 're delivering them the best way possible what does maintaining customer relationships actually cost us so being really clear about these cost centers the key to the business model canvas is its simplicity as i said to you it can be an activity that you could sit down and you could fill out in five minutes but the strength is understanding the value proposition and how in all the other blocks linked to deliver that value proposition strategy is about delivering value or enhancing value it 's about establishing your competitive business position what is it that you do better than anybody else so if i look at airbnb just to give you an example so you can see how this works this is an example of airbnb 's business model its customers are travellers and locals but they come from different they 've got different needs its value proposition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like one of the community for the um for people who actually list on b b they can earn some extra revenue rent out an extra room they can build a community by meeting like-minded travels it therefore for us for um it 's sustainable modelling that 's efficient its resource consumption what is its key activities well it looks at platform development and maintenance videos and photography city events local marketplace development it 's all about enhancing this unique place with locals value proposition its resources support that and it has partners such as locals or investors or payment providers that tap into that as well airbnb 's revenue streams comes from its bookings and it has costs that are related to the platform and obviously local and travel insurance and obviously has marketing community management costs there 's also one for tesla that i 've done here and um again just so you can see how it works now tesla is quite unusual because it is a direct to consumer business model its customer segments are those that are environmentally conscious it tries to offer a variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the different types of models you can charge it anywhere you don 't if you want to ring up and test drive it you can actually just schedule it to be in your home so it 'll be delivered to you so it 's that 21st century service stuff it 's as easy as charging your phone so it 's simple it 's it does work on delivery as well quickest acceleration longest range um and then what activities what resources support what partners support the value proposition it 's revenue streams basically it comes from well it 's almost it 's a car creation hardware supplier and also tech tech company so it 's got a variety of different revenue streams if you think about it so what do we do now that we 've got the business model canvas out in front of us for some of you your value proposition is going to be easy to think about and create because you 've got a pretty good handle on it for others it may be the first time you 've actually considered it in this way so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we call your core capabilities because your core capabilities is what 's going to help drive or create your value proposition so what are your core capabilities things that usually if you 're doing a swot analysis most of you will be familiar with the swot analysis strengths weaknesses opportunities threats in your business easiest way to do it is to draw up the quadrant work through the swot analysis do it every six months or so your core capabilities are likely to come from your strengths inherent to you they are things that are hard to replicate they are things that make you unique they are things that you do better than your competitors so use these tools to be clear about what your core capabilities are because your core capabilities are what is what 's going to help you create your value proposition it may be that as an exercise that you have a group of people you can do this with so you might have a team you might have a management team you might have a group of staff or colleagues that you feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's always best in a group of people often to do this this is a really simple post-it note exercise so you can put the quadrants up on a whiteboard for example or a screen like this and have your team put forward what they believe your key activities are your revenue streams are your customer segments are post-it notes are great because you can just everyone can put their ideas up and then what you can do is work on each of the building blocks individually so get rid of the post-it notes that are duplicate work on the ideas amalgamate them the similarities work so you 've got a consensus on what it is that your revenue streams are what it is that your customer segments are what is it your key activities are what you are doing is you are finding a way to understand your value why is it that your customers buy from you what need do you meet so what now what now that we 've got this tool it 's not the first time we 've been through a snap lockdown so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of us we had to perhaps think on our feet as i 've already mentioned in the first period of covert last year but we 've now come through a sustained period of change what we should be seeing now is that you 've got systems that perhaps you come with up on the run that you can now automate they should be documented in some way shape or form and we already saw it in the second lockdown those businesses that responded well were the ones that just rolled out the systems from prep from what went before so things were automated things were documented the contingency plan was in place so when the button is pressed and the thing about these snap lockdowns is what we know is they will come with very short notice we can go quickly continually engage in network so engage your team in this process engage your supplier network so that you can talk about the what if so when they happen again you 've got a clear plan for moving forward um there should if we can talk brutally honestly there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this again and i say all this hoping that we don 't but i 'm a conservative planner that likes to look at sometimes making sure that i 've got my feet on the ground in the worst case scenario so if we had to do it again making sure that we we 've got a process in place and that we are staying connected so over this time more than ever and moving forward into this new new normal where we 've got a plan for our value creation understanding your business values and they can be if you haven 't worked through your you know your with your team a group of values your personal values why you went into business in the first place what it is that 's important to you being clear about what they are in these periods and leaning on them it 's inauthentic to think to just continue to move forward as if nothing has changed and in we 're looking for authenticity we buy from people that we like we live in this what some of you might be aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy so we 've well think about you know united history i think it was we moved we talk about the different ages that we 've moved through the agricultural movement shift the industrial revolution the post-industrial revolution we now live in the technological age we are more connected than we have been than ever before everyone 's got a device which allows means that are also hot it 's a hyper-competitive industry it 's now easy to make choice for our consumers if we don 't like something we 'll simply go somewhere else so it 's not enough anymore just to put a sign out the door and say this is what i do our role as business owners is to make sure that we understand what our value is we understand the needs that we make that we meet and we communicate it clearly to our customers in a way that they understand so that they see the value so leaning on your values throughout this time will help you do this it 's one of the wonderful things covert has shown us is there 's strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us in business who are going through the same difficulties be helpful abundance breeds abundance so thinking about how you can help each other over this time uh just to give you some there are still some grants and resources that are available so federal government did in the october budget talk about the expensive scheme so there is um asset purchase up to 150k you can claim the full deduction in your tax returns there 's also a temporary loss carryback scheme which i think doesn 't kick in until 1920 tax year that is you can claim losses from previous years on ford moving tax returns state government has got obviously the payroll tax exemption which some of you might be relying on still which does end when job keeper ends they have however some of you may have already been had exposure to electricity credit or they 've announced the electricity credit to two and a half thousand dollars that business owners have access to small business wa.gov does have great resources that are always up to date in terms of stimulus offerings the double the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises but there 's also they haven 't actually done too much in terms of ongoing stimulus that they might offer with the budget announcements of a few weeks ago so make sure that you 're up to date with that jackie i 'm sure will tell you about the city of perth economic rebound strategy which has grants available up to five thousand dollars and those grants can be for use for things like uh marketing coordinators to do social media how would you describe those grants jackie you know there are some people in this room that have actually already applied and been successful in receiving a grant so the grants can be used for many things you can apply for you know fit out work or new signage or marketing support um you want to replace your flooring or something like that um that grant is available to you up to five thousand dollars um keeping in mind that the new prospectus for the next round will also be launched uh towards the end of this financial year so there may be some other business grants that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the up to 5 000 small business grant available um i 'll be around afterwards if you want to have a chat about that yeah so um if i can just wrap up quickly today understand your value understand your competitive business position understand what it is that

owners of the land on which we meet that we 'll jump on our people of Western Australia and pay my respects to elder 's past and present it is indeed a privilege to be standing on wood Jack from our country due to the declaration of a public health emergency and the existence of a state of emergency tonight 's meeting is being held by a video conference and live streamed on the city 's website welcome to all those people that are viewing the briefing online for the benefit of those viewing the meeting online a list of attendees for this evening 's meeting will now be displayed and if it hasn 't been yet well I 'm sure we can do it a little bit like a lot so Scot if you 're listening out I just asked if you can check that out or somebody from governance Thank You CEO do you have any apologies for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a disclosure of interest from Commissioner Kosova relating to the first item on the agenda the is any partiality interest and the nature of that interest is that there has been a past business relationship that this consulting company that plays that for the lip balm for the record of the meeting thank you well matters for which the meeting may be closed yes we do have one and that 's relating to the confidential item six point one nine Memorandum of Understanding and so behind closed doors at the end of the meeting and from here on in will we have the offices reports on which commissioners can ask questions and seek explanation so item 6.1 happy heart proprietary limited north bridge precinct the match funding grant for the illuminated streets on commissioners play Thank You chair my question relates to the sign and whether the total amount requested of thirty five thousand dollars only covers the sign or whether there are additional activities foreseen within this budget allocation through your chair can I suggest we asked Virginia withers senior sponsorship officer for that response thank you so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can definitely answer that one so the budget for the recommended budget for this sponsorship would cover the sign only it 's part of a much larger program of activation and capital works that would be invested by the by the applicant if I may share just thanks Tabitha so 35 that is this a good way of delivering this sign value for money for the city noting that the party is not covered except by exceptional circumstances in our policy or is this something that the city could deliver without this grant as I as I understand it it would be value for money because essentially the the whole detail of the of the costs have not been fully worked through so for example is based on a certain proposal that needs to be done up by like looked at an electric electric allah near a structural engineer so this is really sort of a base cost and any additional cost would be met by the applicant from my experience with these type of projects i think it 's it is quite good value for money but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulsome analysis if you like now that 's that 's really good thanks Tabitha and the positioning of the sign I noticed it I love it by the way I noticed it 's a little bit along the street is that the ideal positioning of the sign or is that as a result of the applicant location at the moment the proposal is based on the location of the of the electrical poles which were proposed to be the support system as I mentioned that still needs to be worked through and the exact final position of of the sign will be dictated by the struck the structural engineers report and what 's feasible within the poles or the Heritage fabric around around the sign so I think there 's a little still a little bit of wiggle room against the exact final okay the sign okay thanks Tabitha Thank You champ Thank You Chancellor commissioner concern do you have any questions yes thank you each a commission as commitment McMath said I think it 's a great idea I like the the sign I think it 's an excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind you sure but just trying to understand so the sign I 'm guessing is only going to be so when illuminated or when installed is only going to be visible from a perspective looking north towards it it 's not obviously going to be double-sided I 'm guessing is that the case that is correct yeah and I couldn 't see anything in the report as to whether the discussions that you 've had with the proponent in this instance have extended as far as who 's going to be responsible for maintenance or repair of the signs should that be required and also for playing the electricity bill to keep it switched on I 'm just wondering if your discussions have gone into those territories and very broadly the details of that would be need to work be worked out in the sponsorship agreement but we do have a standard precinct development sponsorship contract which holds the sponsorship recipient to all feature maintenance so another example would be the planter boxes that historic art have delivered for example thank you thanks commissioner okay I don 't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea as well item six point two is the revocation of council policy fourteen point three the deed licensing of underage events the commissioners asked for some more detail on this at the last ordinary councilmen so commissioners any questions or queries no thank you No thank you quite straightforward Commissioner Kosova okay thank you thank you okay and once again item 6.33 also very similar nature no question sure nothing from me either Thank You commissioners okay the the next item is the item six point four major events Twenty twenty one twenty Twenty twenty twenty-one and Lucy I 'd like to commend the substan bringing forth such a comprehensive before our world underwater concerned commissioners will obviously have some comment comment on this I would like to start I 'm happy to start chair thank you Thank You Commissioner look there my question relates my first question relates to page 19 where we have a table that outlines the financial risk to the city and I note that that includes a cumulative total including staff costs what I 'm interested in taking by way of example the skyworks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commit a significant amount of external funding to this project from it from a time point of view so if we were to decide at this point in time based on the information we have to proceed at what point would we need to make a contractual commitment externally or withdraw from it without severe financial penalty to the city through ug could I ask tabatha to respond to that because there there is some detail that 's important to cover here there 's multiple suppliers not just one supplier and if you 're talking about just the fireworks then that is different to the lead time on all suppliers but if it 's okay with you chair I 'd get Tabitha to go into the detail yes thank you thank you Tara thank you for the question so essentially marius right there are quite a lot of complicated tenders it 's about ten tenders in in total for this event the fireworks component is four hundred and fifty five thousand dollars in itself the staff costs are a total of five hundred and seventy one thousand so in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it starts to really ramp up is in September in October but the end of October we 'd be looking at an investment of two hundred thousand dollars in external contracts that is based on our assumption that contractors will be willing to enter into contracts with terms of a cost recovery only so essentially that we would say to them there 's a high risk around this event should the event be counsel we will compensate you for your cost to date so we 've based it on our understanding of what our suppliers typically accrue in terms of expenditure throughout their contract life and so by end of October we 'd be looking at about two hundred thousand by end of November about three hundred and ninety thousand end of December 675 and then the majority obviously around the end of January of course that is all dependent on the terms that the suppliers are actually willing to enter it into with the city thank you Tabitha Chimayo just have a follow-up question so we 're in uncertain times and morale encouraged by the progress we 've made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state government but on this basis of the rapidly changing times and hopefully all for the better I guess in asking that question on the sky works at most we 're looking at 200 to 300 thousand dollars to buy some time in order to make a final of final decision I noticed Tabitha in and I really thought that the committee input was really valuable especially around the sky works and the city involvement but I also noted that there was quite a compelling response to question one around the survey applicants willingness to attend an event with more than 100,000 people and that would only be 40 percent it was would only be on government advice so it would obviously that was to proceed would require it to be consistent with the the latest advice from the state government so with respect to those observations but the inputs from the committee around if it was if it wasn 't to proceed are there aspects of the committee input that could still be incorporated in a precede decision that will in will in fact enhance potentially enhance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair if I may we can certainly look into that but it would be an additional cost so the alternative options are for Australia Day including the the family events trail the markets the lighting etc and the burette concert the big rock concert is part of the usual costs for for Sky works anyway but all the rest of it that 's probably about a cost of 100,000 so that would be an additional cost and probably additional staff resources as well we probably couldn 't do both within the the usual event team and resources that we have for Sky works so that would need to be considered but yes everything 's possible with with it with the lead time that we have thank you thank you thanks oh okay Commissioner thank you check Mishnah through you to other the CEO or to tabatha in a similar vein to Deputy Chair Commissioner Vic maths questions I 'm just wondering if administration is able to further dissect the the skyworks costs tally that 's shown in the table on page 19 so that we can get a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different functions or events that have cumulatively been put under the banner of skyworks recognizing what tabatha said earlier that I think it was in the order of around four hundred and fifty thousand dollars has historically been attributed to the actual cost of the fireworks specifically with the total of all other costs being inclusive of all of the supplementary work and and events that occur on the day so firstly yes if if that could be provided somehow ahead of the council meeting or in the agenda for next week 's meeting be most grateful for that and through you a Czech Commissioner just a further question I have is I 'm just interested to understand recognizing that when the sky works event was canceled on the day in 2017 as a result of a tragic aviation accident I 'm interested to know what was the cost to the city of Perth of the cancellation of that event only hours before the fireworks were due to occur and I appreciate if staff don 't have that information at their disposal I 'm happy for that to be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you Thank You commissioner I 've got a few questions and observations as well just going back to the tab of the record the table relating to the incremental expenditure if you like on page 19 with the scarred works it would be good if we could have just appended next to the numbers on star works and into July August September October what actually the staff costs were involved along every month of those so we can just get an idea of what is our our embedded costs and also get an idea of what they what actually are goods and service is there and obviously the things that are proposing more risk a couple of other questions are I 've got some comments tonight after about these events but I 'll ask some questions about the other events with New Year 's Eve it seems to me that whether we have an event or not a lot of people will come into town would that be right but we can 't stop them can we yeah now yes if that 's the question then absolutely a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the city if we don 't manage that those crowds particularly in the current of our so therefore if let 's look at a scenario of given the announcement on Monday which in fairness to the stop lighting this report they weren 't aware of where we 've gone to phase four I 'm a now told but made wonderful news that phase five awaits us all things going well July the 15th based upon that advice the we are probably going to get a lot of people come to town anyway and what concerns me is if we don 't continue to plan and apply resources to New Year 's Eve I think if Western Australia is done really well with Kogut which we have people are going to be in a highly celebrated removed and we are going to have a lot of people in town in fact way more than has happened in the past so I 've probably suggest that we in light of current advice that we need to perhaps rethink that approach it 's I accept that the report was written earlier while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well I well it 's essentially a Christmas concert for all intents and purposes I think that 's probably a better way of talking about it but my understanding was that it was originally an event in forest place and and as a result of the popularity of the event and the size of the event it was relocated to the Supreme Court gardens is that correct that 's correct yes that 's correct okay I think given the circumstances of the dire position that our core retail areas oneself in that this could be an opportunity to shift the Christmas nativity scene Stoke concert back to forest place now I know they could present some problems but is it feasible that the notice we have now we can indeed almost reinvent what we 've had to still have a very very Christmasy family Christmas event in forest place simply because our retailers need that type of activation and we and I 'd be much more comfortable providing that social distancing has left us I 'd be much more comfortable in spending the money on a forest place abandon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of carrying all the people in one night perhaps do it over two nights so the retailer 's give to lots of people coming in I don 't want to put you on the spot tabatha but it would be good if the staff could reflect upon that and give us some advice leading up to the council meeting and I can do better than that chair if you wish I can I can answer that question and the previous ones as well so in terms of moving the event back into forest chase we can definitely do that and we would probably recommend at least ticketing an event if not fencing it to ensure that we 're controlling crowds and having it over multiple nights it probably at least three or four to cater for the the number of crowds that we have currently the 10,000 people across two nights so we can absolutely do that and integrate it into the Christmas lights trail of course that is would be a significant cost as well probably you know at least the 300,000 or more but we could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but certainly something we could consider and feasibly do with ticketing and managing numbers even if they 're they 're free tickets so yes for charging for a family function yeah absolutely yes so then in terms of Commissioner cassavas questions if I may through the chair we can absolutely send through a more detailed table the higher level table that was included in the report is a conglomeration of of a number of different breakdowns including our marketing costs contractors staff time etc so we can send you the raw data for that and you can see the detail broken down for that that table no problem and in terms of the cost of the cancellation when there was the unfortunate air crash aircraft crash essentially we had to pay 100% costs for that event plus extra you know return fireworks that sort of things so it actually cost us more to cancel on the day then we would have would have cost us to proceed with the event and luckily we also did receive our grant from Lottery West on that that year as well otherwise we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of the question regarding New Year 's Eve and managing crowds you 'll notice that the alternative proposal for New Year 's Eve is nearly the same cost as what we would have normally invested in New Year 's Eve and that 's largely because of that we really actually can 't control the cost and what we were doing was simply pivoting away from large crowds and gatherings of people and trying to rather collaborate with the bricks and mortar businesses to get them to capitalize and cope with the with the crowds within their own venues and and quite likely in the streets through increased you know open-air dining that sort of thing so definitely options that we probably should consider regardless of what the situation is with kovat at the time to help benefit those local bricks and mortar businesses be my recommendation thanks Timothy okay now I just wanted to make a cut poison and I 'll be putting forward an alternative motion for the fork coming the June council meeting and that 's going to be that we actually do not defer skywards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on the basis that the commissioners are meeting with the commissioner for police and the chief health officer on Thursday to get a good understanding of what the risks are involved in in in continuing on with with convening this event or facilitating this event but on the basis I 'd that I thought there 's a broad acceptance particularly with the commissioners that if social distancing is in place then it is impossible with a a crowd of that magnitude to mattock and so things don 't go as well as planned then we are going to have to put in place some type of cancellation regime which leads me to the procurement look I have to say that our suppliers have enjoyed our custom over the years and the time I think now has come for them but for one year only to share a bit of risk of the city and and I 'd like to see our procurement processes waited to give more weight to those suppliers that are willing to share more risk in the likelihood that the event needed to be canceled so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice and early so people can have comment on it but that will also be guided by the advice of the Commission of the police and the chief health officer on Thursday in saying that and putting forth that alternate motion that skyworks should continue provided that social distancing isn 't in force at that time I think the the consultation that has been undertaken which has been quite broad and it has been done in some cases in the the city odd note the ABC survey there 's not unanimous support for this event in fact the feedback we 've received from several of our traders and major focuses that they believe the money could be spent elsewhere I don 't believe it 's the rather the commissioners to be making such a huge policy decision about taking skyworks off the annual event calendar because that it really is a decision for the council and the Lord nearly no return but I really think they need to have that conversation sooner rather than later and they really need to consult widely hope to get a really good understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our break points the best interest of the state and the city 's obligations under the city of Perth back so I think that the city if we can move forward with this event we can provide a solution I don 't believe it will be exactly the same as previous years however it I think will be the best in the circumstances so we will have a motion an alternative motion framed and to you by Friday lunchtime following our meeting with the chair for the commission of the place and their chief health officer just one other thing sorry I forgot to ask and it 's something that would be good to have us and advice on the the event is the Buraq event which is it I said it on ok which is conducted adjacent to the sky works once again a lot of feedback received from educators is that they get little or no benefit from events in in Langley Park of the Supreme Court Gardens I accept the fact that our food and beverage industries do best time is there an opportunity to to convene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an answer yet but is that a possibility unfortunately chair Commissioner thanks for the question that event is is far too large to fit into forest chase or so yeah wouldn 't be a possibility I thank you for that just a thought like I say there 's a bit of work to do for the staff look I 'll take the hat off to you because you 've got this covert virus that 's changing the rules every 10 minutes yeah but um but we all need to work together one I think to to achieve that so thank you to all the staff that have been involved with that and truly making some effort excuse me chair you think excuse me chair your content was frozen we couldn 't hear you for most of that is that from everybody oh oh code that doesn 't matter um can you hit me now yep yes okay it must be their network okay commissioners have any further comments on that and no thank you Jim okay moving on to the renewal of lease six point but I have one question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CEO has delegated authority to do with this anyone is there a reason why this has come to council um thanks Jai Krishna all need to follow up and check that and get back to you that 's okay and and certainly item three I don 't think you delegate something that 's already delegated sure I 'll follow you Thanks you know I threw you Chiclets on on that particular item and further to Bill 's remarks my reading of it was that it 's proposed to create a new one off delegation as far as I could establish and that then is being called up in recommendation three so I share your sentiments that if in fact it 's proposed to authorize the CEO to execute the lease if no objections are received during advertising then the simple thing to do would just be write that into recommendation three stay of introducing or relying on an exists or a new delegation which I presumed would then need to be folded into the amended delegated authority register that 's referenced in item six point eleven all right yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and then take what action you need to do certainly thank you next one it 's pretty much the same autumn isn 't it six point six sign feedback yeah okay thank you next item is six point seven the financial activity statement any comments or queries or questions please and I think a chair okay no thank you Thank You commissioners next item is item 6.8 payments from the municipal fund any questions comments or feedback commissioners no the events governance frame work policy this is come back after consultation with zero response I know and so any comments questions or queries on this one just to commend the staff for all the development of the policy I think thank you that 's great feedback commissioner okay moving on to 6.10 council policy review commissioners go ahead Lin apologies through you chair commissioner it would just be useful if in the agenda item the various tables that are included if the officers could please include the policy number for every policy that 's listed in those tables because at the moment the policy number is missing and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clarity if that could be included that would be great not a problem commissioners Commissioner McMahon Thank You chair just noting the direction of travel with respect to this really important aspect of governance a thorough review of all the council policies deletion of those that are no longer recovered an appropriate delegation with respect to operational policies I I think the other aspect of this is the need for a and I believe this has been identified before chair about the need for a process by which all policies are reviewed on a rotational basis to ensure that they remain current and relevant so this is a bit of a cleanup but it would be good to have a process for future Council thank you Thank You Commissioner um yeah my sentiments as well it 's it 's a big joke Oh and so that need of doing so it 's good get it underway okay next item is 6.11 the new review of allegations the partners apologies sorry three yuichi commissioner I just noticed Bill Parker had raised his hand wasn 't sure who 's in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs per I felt like I 'd missed my opportunity no one was looking but I just wanted to very quickly respond so Commissioner McMath ska meant they 're around so within the the most recent policy framework that we adopted we actually apply to risk matrix to all of the policies that then dictate when they 're reviewed so I 'm really confident once we go through this review depending on how highly classified a policy is from a risk perspective we 'll be able to review those you know a very consistent framework that 's it thank you yep thanks well done bill yeah I 'm sorry for missing your hand up to very remiss of me we 're on item 6.1 one the delegated authority register commissioners yes over through you check Mishnah the only request I have of staff is similar to the one I raised on the previous item and that is if administration could please just insert the actual delegation reference number for each delegation that they have listed in the tables appearing throughout this report it would make it easier to to reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank You Commissioner thank you do commissioner McMahon know Thank You chair no questions okay thank you moving on to the next item the nomination of a commissioner to the Mandara Regional Council any questions there no thank you I think we can move on to the next item which probably the most one of the most significant items that the commissioners will deal with and that 's the corporate business plan I don 't have any questions all I do is have compliments for the staff you basically had to deconstruct an entire financial system and and bring forward what is an outstanding and document an exemplar version of what a corporate business plan should be so well done to all concerned yes sir just to echo your remarks the paper and the attachment actually with the business plan succinctly provides the very essence of a corporate business plan and a way forward I think it 's in the best interests of transparency as to what be the city 's focusing on and applying funds to so there 's been a huge amount of work in this and and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what 's come forward for consideration by council Thank You Commissioner Cassano Thank You chair Commissioner just supporting the sentiments that you and Deputy Chief Commissioner McMath have expressed and also just like to add that I think for for an incoming council to have this as the as the baseline or the foundation of the corporate business plan that charts the road ahead for the next four years is really going to be a fabulous benchmark and will also allow up the council in subsequent years to calibrate or adjust the thresholds of what makes it into or not into the corporate business plan depending on that councils appetite for your scale and cost of projects moving forward so yeah I think it 's it 's an excellent framework that will really support the incoming council with with making some strategic decisions in future Thank You commissioner okay moving on to item 6.1 for I think I could just say there did a financial plan which obviously their hand in glove with the corporate business plan so I just I just would hope now that they using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts into financial planning is done at the corporate business plan and 20% is applied to the budget which is there to fund the corporate business plan and on I 'm sure that the staff that we have will be able to translate that into action in the years to come okay next item is the differential rates public advertising there of any questions please item 6.15 no thank you Thank You commissioners none from me either next item special budget review quarter a quarter for any questions please and no thank you today 's okay Thank You commissioners next item item 6.1 7 I just had some questions relating to the the if this has come from the minutes of if this has come from an audit committee meeting should we not be looking at the minutes of that meeting or do can you provide some information on there this that no sorry I 'm glad you 've raised that we did have a discussion 90 minutes before coming into this meeting to that exact effects so if it 's okay we 'll take that away and undertake a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those couple of items that require a decision of counsel and we are working as you would be aware we are working on a revised format for the presentation of those minutes and any subsequent recommendations that come from that committee I 'm hopefully that will be implemented by next month okay think so we 'll have this back next month after those process is reflected so you don 't want to see those items before those processes are implemented or well yes we do but I 'm just saying so we will still deal with this I got as a standalone agenda item you 're comfortable with that yes that new process will apply for next month if that 's acceptable right and the the report is silent upon the Audit Committee having supported the document so and I know that the only reference is the last box where it says officer and audit and Risk Committee recommendation I 'd like to please at least have the the the date of the Audit Committee and some confirmation that it was voted upon and approve please tell the feedback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry chair Commissioner its something 's just left out at me and I 'm just wondering if when bill is doing that review could you please also review the appropriateness of on page 118 of the agenda papers on this report under the heading of legal and statutory implications it makes reference to regulations 17 of the local government audit regs I 'm not convinced without having reread them but that 's necessarily the right reference but I 'd be happily happy to stand corrected but if someone could please just review the applicability of that would be great absolutely thank you Thank You commissioner good to go okay Commissioner MCMAP no okay moving on to the next one items point one eight which is the policy fraud and corruption control I note that this has come through the audit process and has no they into a briefing session as such is that correct that is correct chair this one was commenced prior to the adoption of the council policy on the format that we needed to follow so we can either revert to deal with that in the Corden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its current journey I given that we are are going to eventually receive the findings and recommendations of the inquiry in civic city of Perth from completion of our and Minister I 'd be happy to defer consideration of this until we 've actually seen those recommendations because I if I think we need to respond at a policy level in some way and this may be one of the areas that we need to respond with so I I 'd be I can move a motion of deferral at the council meeting if you so choose or you could choose to before chair if the feedback of the other commissioners is they support your own idea we can withdraw administratively and bring it back at the appropriate time when the inquiry is recommendations are being considered commissioners are you happy with that approach sure my apologies but my system froze so I 'm back I assume we 're looking at item 6.18 first so I was comfortable with this policy I think the input to be informed in the play and with all the available information especially the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment into action so it was more around making sure that the planned development was informed as opposed to a support for having a policy around forward and and corruption so I was I was comfortable with the papers stood it was really just the implementation of the plan timing okay all right Commissioner Cassano any way we can we can let 's just let it go through I I 've got some concerns about the way the policies drafted okay yeah in it in the quick we can do with that as well in the context of it make statements about what we 're going to do but it doesn 't actually provide a policy position of the city on this that was where I was coming from so but look we can keep it on the agenda and we can and do this I 'm leaving this next one okay I 'm sorry chair I hadn 't heard your comments before I really probably more appropriate to do it at the meeting anyway to raise those concerns so great the next item is item 6.1 9 the confidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go behind closed doors electronically you Kyah good morning you my man goes welcome to a new our butcher land on which we sit I especially like to acknowledge the elders past and present and the other Aboriginal people and non-aboriginal people that are here and I hope everyone has a good day and I especially like that knowledge more great great ancestors because without him I wouldn 't be talking to you today and thanks very much for inviting me to do the work in the country thank you [Music] so my reconciliation really means it 's a two-way learning let 's work together and make things happen for Aboriginal people and want out your people well I think that reconciliation is about time truth-telling honesty and it 's about time you know for me as an Aboriginal person as and non-aboriginal xin it and aboriginals working together you know working in partnership reconciliation means you know everybody working together and and everybody everybody being part of Australia having grown up in country towns with a lot of friends that were Aboriginal going to school with them playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my heart and it 's something that the city of Perth has come a long way in reconciliation over the past five years well we can get together and make things happen and we 've got to think about the future and our kids they 're our future and we 've got to look after them because they you know as we pass on with what I hand things back down to them and the only way we 're going to do it that 's let 's all work together and support each other for me it means everything it means owned it means that the way we move forward and and how we move forward you know [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] there 's still a long way to go with reconciliation because we 're just starting now but what it should happen about say 4050 years back well you may reconciliation it 's like you can go as far as you want but I think there 's got to be there you know the first steps forward first and they might only be small steps but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 're doing something you know so you know we got a long way to go I 'm looking further than 2020 I 'm looking at 29 and that 's when we were hoping that we the reconciliation what would help is that their government recognized us as the first people here in Australia although the city has come a long way in such a short time with our approach to reconciliation we have still a long way to go I think this is the real opportunity to recast our future and by that I mean why shouldn 't our Aboriginal culture history he celebrated why why shouldn 't it become one of the major tourist attractions that bring people from all around the world I see that happening in the future and I think that 's the future I 'd like to see recast at the city of Perth [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] probably one little thing that 's inspired me in this year in the last couple of years has been involved with that City Council I think that they 've come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2018 and since the adoption of that plan the city has embraced its responsibility to deliver on actions within that plan and take some genuine steps towards reconciliation I think that looking at the the plan that we sat down and did together has given us a good groundwork for for moving forward collaborating with the traditional owners has really helped the city learn about our history and culture and that of the Aboriginal people this has been really important for our wider staff to get to really understand what some of the issues are and why the common goal of reconciliation is important I never be ashamed of your color or you your culture hold you it up and be proud of it we 're comfortable [Music] you [Music] you [Music] how do we carefully use the water that we have what are the technologies what are the practices that we can do to actually have a lesser impact on the environment the irrigation central control includes 104 irrigation controllers irrigating up to 90 hectares of green space across the city all that infrastructure talks back to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources to irrigate the city currently today we 're a hundred and nineteen thousand kilolitres under allocation across all three of the city 's groundwater licenses we need to make our city a lot greener and that 's really important because it makes it a cooler City it makes it a more livable city but that also means that trees need water so now we 're thinking about is how do we capture all the stormwater so that they can actually feed into our tree pits how do we use the amount of water we 've got but also the quality of the water as well so that 's in a very important initiative where we 're using existing rain water to help with our all our street trees as well so we can make it a greener City but not having a massive impact on the environment in terms of use of water linked in to that we use gross pollutant traps around the city in terms of all our drainage so that we 're not having pollution go into the Swan River as well we anticipate around 30,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent thunderstorms that Perth received there 's also been efficiencies in power savings there 's also been efficiencies in staff time we start looking at all of our infrastructure combined with our buildings combined with the types of landscaping and if we do have all those with our water we 're still really starting to respond and adapting to all those climate changes [Music] everyone used to dress up yeah everyone was paired in those days dress up to the tops hats toys suits and all that mean I had a good time there yeah yeah and I was thinking oh look at this you know everybody it looks so good and I was impressed with the band and the people the paint blue red they were so dressed up no you know really dressed up Nat King Cole and his wife come over and Bill Bradley presented him with a boom right and these are the original photos from back in the oil cooler bird eyes and everyone used to have a great time we so do all sorts of dances the Hokey Pokey get ready for Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went in because you know I 'm just from the country and I 'm here with all these flash people yeah yeah and and they all just danced so well and so was it well attended by namaz oh yeah Thank You commissioners in Syria we 've now moved out from behind closed doors I 'd like to thank commissioners and CEO and staff for your valuable feedback and input today and also like to thank the attendants of those in our virtual gallery for showing the interest in there if there 's City thank you thank you all and good evening you"

deputation do we have any questions yes we do chair Commissioner we have a question from Shannon Lee director of streets for people the question is what specifically is the city doing to provide immediate temporary Street treatments to allow more footpath space on footpaths that are not suitable for safe physical distancing the answer from the officers of the sea near Perth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priority for many years this is in recognition of our focus on walking as a priority transport mode this means that most of the city 's footpaths are suitable for the current environment the city has however looked to reduce the need for pedestrians to touch traffic light buttons by introducing Auto peg crossing with main roads and we 're currently working to remove street clutter to maximize the usable space on the paths for example we 're currently looking to remove the bus shelters on Williams Street to widen the usable space on this footpath that was the first question chair I have another one yes go ahead please say yeah same person has said what specifically is the city doing to provide immediate safe cycling infrastructure to support the tripling of cycling numbers that has occurred in Perth the answer is although anecdotally site cycling numbers have increased in metropolitan Perth the number of cyclists within the city itself hasn 't varied significantly therefore the city 's existing infrastructure is capable of handling the relatively minor changes it should also be noted that the Central City is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively safe compared to the higher speeds seen in suburban Perth and along major highways the city needs to be conscious of overspending on unnecessary temporary works when there is a clear need for our funding to support local businesses and the community getting back to normal thanks chief Thank You CEO do we have any other questions no further questions we do have adaptation in relation to the planning on the agenda T would you 'd like to read that out now yes thanks chair Commissioner a deputation has been received by Shawn Morrison from the libous in relation diet and 13.2 the initiation of amendment number 43 to city planning

fully supports offers a recommendation for you and this includes our support of the various bill form provisions that have been proposed to ensure that the site 's built out to a high standard I 'd like to thank Jason and his team particularly Rob Craig Kathy and Edward who have been so cooperative throughout the last few months moving forward the intent is to really move to a DA as soon as possible and we 're hopeful that the city will move quickly on EPA referral and public consultations alike so that therefore we can hopefully have this item back to the commissioners as soon as

council members who might be interested to review the policy amendments or the draft policy that 's proposed to go out for advertising and provide any submissions that they may wish to to do all that because it will it will specifically inform future decisions around sponsorship and granted by the city well said I don 't have anything further to add so on that basis I 'd put the motion those in

agenda is the reserved cancellation on the rain square redevelopment or than 13.8 and I 'd like to move that motion but with just a footnote that staff prepare a report that delegates these type of matters for the decision of the CEO in the future if that could come back when time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happy to second chair Commissioner Thank You Commissioner Kesava thank you you 're

insignificant chin okay I can absolutely second that you you are able just to move second and bike but I 'm happy to second it to get it on the the table for discussion Commissioner Cassano do you have any comments well whilst I 'm not a big fan of the phrase I think it 's befitting in this instance so simply saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be great if if the expenditure wasn 't incurred by any relevant party or stakeholder but it is necessary under the circumstances so happy to support the recommendation thank you thank you our support the motion a this the circumstances behind having to undertake those works urgently I thought were well fair and reasonable and I fully support the decisions made by the CEO and the offices to proceed with the works and the way they did them so I support Commissioner McMahon that I understand that more permanent Ward 's which will achieve the same integrity our part of our capital plan so that I would not expect these short-term expenses to be repeated on an annual basis I know I I think that would be a view be held by all people in the administration and the commissioners crew so on that basis I 'll put the motion those in favor yes thank you Commissioner has voted for so that motion is carried next item is 13.10 financial activity statement for the period ended 31st of March 2020 emerge please happy to move that we received the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be second chair Thank You commissioner I 'll put that without any further discussion those in favor yes thank you motion is carried through zero next item 13.1 1 payments from the municipal fund April 2020 do I have a mover please happy to move chair seconder 2nd ed chat Thank You Commissioner old way and put that motion without any further discussion those in favor in favor thank you okay next item on the agenda is the coab 19 recovery and rebound activities and I have a an amendment to the motion which is bordering on the procedural but I think it 's important given that the the matter of the three major events historically major events that have been conducted in the city is to be determined at the council meeting it in June so if we go to the officers recommendation which is carried on page 68 thank you I was way way above that and we go to the recommendation and I 'd like to change like to move the motion first and foremost but in moving the most and change item to that that instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endorsed in principle the operating activities in projects outlined in table 1 however deferring allocation of actual expenditure items until such time as the commissioners have given consideration to the conduct of the the three events being the Australia Day skyworks the Christmas nativity and the New Year 's Eve celebrations and for the for the purposes of the minutes the reason for that is that whilst is expenditure isn 't being allocated at the moment it will inform the preparation of the 19 sorry the 2020 2021 budget and so therefore it 's going to be very difficult for us to exactly exactly allocate these funds until such time as we know whether or not these other major events are going to be conducted and and if they are are they going to be conducted at the same scale or at the same time or in the same manner so we need to get a good understanding of that and then we can sit down and a determine the allocation of funds against the activities firstly commissioners are you happy with that clarification and secondly with somebody prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioner ah Thank You commissioner Kesava in speaking for the motion firstly I 'd like to congratulate and acknowledge the efforts of the staff in working the very long hours to essentially find a 10 million billets of operating projects in a corporation that 's just dropped 20 million dollars in car parking revenue so that comes after significant cost-cutting over the last 12 or 18 months led by a CEO but also as a result of a strategic focus on Co good recovery above all else now we accept that the this very very historic long standing events that are essentially under threat as a result of COBIT and so the commissioners at the agenda briefing requested a lot more information so as they can make an informed decision based upon medical advice and other factors in June and on that basis we obviously can 't start allocating expenditure within that 18 by 18 billion dollars allocation to different operating activities until we have a much better understanding of the status of these events going forward Commissioner Kesava yes did so a three-year chair Commissioner did Commissioner McMath wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kasota so commissioner McMann thank you I would like to speak to this motion I particularly like to draw out the significance of the establishment of three committees the marketing and promotion Advisory Committee the city amenity Advisory Committee and the events culture and the arts Advisory Committee I 'd like to reflect on the significance of the establishment of these working committees to in to assist the city in making informed decision as to the best and most effective utilization of resources under those three areas of activity the composition of the committee 's I think speaks for itself and provides an opportunity for our community through these committees to be actively engaged in shaping this resource allocation in not only what we do but how we go about doing it thank you Thank You Commissioner McMaster Commissioner casada thank you to the I wholeheartedly support the comments raised by yourself as well as deputy chair Commissioner McMath and would just like to highlight because I 'm a big fan of alliteration but also because I think the the approach in the phased strategy is worth highlighting and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be implemented by the city in terms of return and recover and reinvent and revive as well as recalibrate and repeat and the associated actions under reach I wholeheartedly support I would though just like to raise a question to and the appropriate general manager here in relation to the advisory committee membership firstly I just note that Robert Whedon 's name so Rob Whedon from the Pan Pacific Hotel whose surname has been misspelled if we could please correct that it appears in the recommendations wh EE do n it 's actually W double D en so I would just like to propose that if the motion is adopted that it be inclusive of that correction the question I have for the relevant general manager and please is just in relation to the bracketed text has been the organization to which each of these advisory committee members are associated with or belong to you I just note Peter samhitas is labeled as being associated with Robert stay now Robert stay is quite a renowned planning and urban design firm however Peter is in his own right a national and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role on this advisory committee would have been in his capacity as quite a experienced an influential artist that 's regarded as said within a struck with in Western Australia Australia as well as having exhibited internationally and that that would be his credential rather than the organisation which is employed by us so if I could just get some clarification on that please through the chair Commissioner confirming that the reason why Peter was appointed to this committee was for that that very reason to bring that expertise so we can make a correction to the notation behind his name but just confirming that that 's the reason why he 's on this particular committee but thank you I 've got nothing further for our chair thank you in closing the debate on I 'd like to on behalf of the city of Perth and indeed all of the city stakeholders thank these people that have that are about to give up their time and provide the city with what will be incredibly important advice on how we should approach recoveries oh that so I thank you all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the meetings and make themselves known and I 'm sure we 'll get some good outcomes from it on that basis if there 's no further discussion I 'd put the motion those in photo yes thank you any Commissioner Kasota has gone up for the minutes taker I 'm happy to get center an email of that amended recommendation if that makes it easy thanks to we will take it although it has been recorded so it should be verbatim ah perhaps you 've found I could just be given a a copy of what 's being recorded just before the minutes per published dementia was there a lot thank you thanks okay um which made them back to the so up that we have given that we 've deferred the audit and Risk Committee items to the next meeting of Council we now move to motions of which previous notice has been given there are none to thank you urgent business no change for some guidance please the deputation with respect to cycling in the city is that something that we can comment on at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of urgent business detergent businesses there for consideration of items and making substantive decisions however those though my understanding there were questions and they and the person who was asked those questions will be given a written response which will be contained in next month 's minutes would that be correct that 's correct chair yeah so that 's that 's the way that will be dealt with Commissioner is does that satisfy your inquiry it was more a comment to make it defer it to another forum you 're very welcome to my comment thing Thank You chair just reflecting on the question and the response there there was the observation that the number of cyclists in the city are accommodated within our current provision of cycling support services and cycleways so it was really just a comment or an observation is that this is a little bit of chicken and egg the better facilities and amenity we provide for cyclists then in other jurisdictions that has indicated that you have more cyclists and and vice versa so I just the need to be aware of how tractive our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to use cycling in order to access the city and to make sure that we do not only meet the demand that 's there now but also future demand thank you okay thanks Commissioner McMath yeah well said I can see a chair Commissioner given the comments being made in a public forum perhaps it could be useful for our general manager of planning and economic development to just give you a very brief update on the work we 're doing at the moment to try and extract funds from the parking fund and we 've identified numerous projects around the city which would enhance the cyclists experience and Jason is working on that at the moment that 'd be excellent thank you so I think you 've actually said everything Marie yes we 're definitely trying to have a more holistic approach to cycling in the city and we 're bringing forward a more complete cycle Network through the city irrespective of demand at this point in time I guess we 're either going to be known as a cycling city and accommodating it or we 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the spate is supporting the funding that we 're trying to access very good okay and there 's no other business basis declare the meeting closed and thank everybody for their attendance thank you [Music] [Music]"

have one deputation do we have any questions yes we do chair Commissioner we have a question from Shannon Lee director of streets for people the question is what specifically is the city doing to provide immediate temporary Street treatments to allow more footpaths space on footpaths that are not suitable for safe physical distancing the answer from the officers of the Celia Perth is that we 've been working towards widening footpaths as a priority for many years this is in recognition of our focus on walking as a priority transport mode this means that most of the city 's footpaths are suitable for the current environment the city has however looked to reduce the need for pedestrians to touch traffic light buttons by introducing Auto peg crossing with main roads and we 're currently working to remove street clutter to maximize the usable space on the paths for example we 're currently looking to remove the bus shelters on William Street to widen the usable space on this footpath that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has said what specifically is the city doing to provide immediate safe cycling infrastructure to support the tripling of cycling numbers that has occurred in Perth the answer is although anecdotally site cycling numbers have increased in metropolitan Perth the number of cyclists within the city itself hasn 't varied significantly therefore the city 's existing infrastructure is capable of handling the relatively minor changes it should also be noted that the central city is a 40 kilometer our zone making cycling on the road network relatively safe compared to the higher speeds seen in suburban Perth and along major highways the city needs to be conscious of overspending on unnecessary temporary works when there is a clear need for our funding to support local businesses and the community getting back to normal thanks Thank You CEO um do we have any other questions no further questions we do have adaptation in relation to they 're planning on him on the agenda would you like to read that out now yes thanks chair commissioner a deputation has been received by Shawn Morrison from the Libous in relation to item 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning scheme

do you have any comments well whilst I 'm not a big fan of the phrase I think it 's befitting in this instance so simply saying it is what it is the report outlines it it would be great if if the expenditure wasn 't incurred by any relevant party or stakeholder but it is necessary under the circumstances so happy to support the recommendation thank you thank you our support the motion a this the circumstances behind having to undertake those works urgently I I thought well fair and reasonable and I fully support the decisions made by the CEO and the office is to proceed with the works and the way they did them so I support Commissioner McMahon that I understand that more permanent works which will achieve the same integrity our part of our capital plan so that I would not expect these short-term expenses to be repeated on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you be held by all people in the administration and the commissioners crew so on that basis I 'll put the motion those in favor yes thank you Commissioner has voted for so that motion is carried next item is 13.10 financial activity statement for the period ended 31st of march 2020 mother please happy to move that we received the

next item 13.1 1 opponents from the municipal fund April 2020 do I have a mover please happy to move to second I second it chair Thank You Commissioner old way and put that motion without any further discussion those in favor say thank you okay next item on the agenda is the Coburg 19 recovery and rebound activities and I have a an amendment to the motion which is bordering on the procedural but I think it 's important given that the the matter of the three major events historically major events that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the council meeting it in June so if we go to the officers recommendation which is carried on page 68 thank you I was way way above that and we go to the recommendation and I 'd like to change I 'd like to move the motion first and foremost but in moving the most and change item to that that instead of approving the list of operational activities that it becomes endorsed in principle the operating activities in projects outlined in table 1 however deferring allocation of actual expenditure items until such time as the commissioners have given consideration to the conduct of the the the three events being the Australia Bay skyworks the Christmas nativity and the New Year 's Eve celebrations and for the for the purposes of the minutes the reason for that is that whilst is expenditure isn 't being allocated at the moment it will inform the preparation of the xix sorry the 2020 2021 budget and so therefore it 's going to be very difficult for us to exactly exactly allocate these funds until such time as we know whether or not these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they are are they going to be conducted at the same scale or at the same time or in the same manner so we need to get a good understanding of that and then we can sit down and a determine the allocation of funds against the activities firstly commissioners are you happy with that clarification and secondly with somebody prepared to murder so moved thank you yeah happy the second carry me sir Thank You Commissioner Josiah in speaking for the motion firstly I 'd like to congratulate and acknowledge the efforts of the staff in working the very long hours to essentially find a 10 million billets of operating projects in the corporation that 's just dropped 20 million dollars in car parking revenue so that comes after significant cost-cutting over the last 12 or 18 months led by a CEO but also as a result of a strategic focus on Co bird recovery above all else now we said that the the three very historic long standing events that are essentially under threat as a result of covert and so the commissioners at the agenda briefing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an informed decision based upon medical advice and other factors in June and on that basis we obviously can 't start allocating expenditure within that 18 by 18 billion dollars allocation to different operating activities until we have a much better understanding of the the status of these events going forward Commissioner Kesava yes did so a three-year chair Commissioner did Commissioner McMath wish to speak first thank you it 's not the Commissioner Kasota so Commissioner McMahon thank you so I would like to speak to this motion I particularly like to draw out the significance of the establishment of three committees the marketing and promotion Advisory Committee the city amenity Advisory Committee and the events culture and the arts Advisory Committee I 'd like to reflect on the significance of the establishment of these working committees to in to assist the city in making informed decision as to the best and most effective utilization of resources under those three areas of activity the composition of the committee 's I think speaks for itself and provides an opportunity for our community through these committees to be actively engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but how we go about doing it thank you Thank You Commissioner McMaster Commissioner casada thank you to the I wholeheartedly support the comments raised by yourself as well as deputy chair Commissioner McMath and would just like to highlight because I 'm a big fan of alliteration but also because I think the the approach in the face strategy is worth highlighting and that is the the the three phases of the strategy to be implemented by the city in terms of return and recover reinvent and revive as well as recalibrate and repeat and the associated actions under reach I wholeheartedly support I would though just like to raise a question to and the appropriate general manager here in relation to the advisory committee membership firstly I just note that Robert Whedon 's name so Rob Whedon from the Pan Pacific Hotel whose surname has been misspelled if we could please correct that it appears in the recommendations wh ee do n it 's actually w WD en so I would just like to propose that if the motion is adopted that it be inclusive of that correction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please is just in relation to the bracketed text has been the organization to which each of these advisory committee members are associated with or belong to I just note Peter samhitas is labeled as being associated with Robert 's day now Robert 's day is quite a renowned planning and urban design firm however Peter is in his own right a national and internationally regarded artist and I would have presumed that his role on this advisory committee would have been in his capacity as quite a experienced an influential artist that 's regarded as said within a struck with in Western Australia Australia as well as having exhibited internationally and that that would be his credential rather than the organisation which is employed by us so if I could just get some clarification on that please through the chair Commissioner confirming that the reason why Peter was appointed to this committee was for that that very reason to bring that expertise so we can make a correction to the notation behind his name but just confirming that that 's the reason why he 's on this particular committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair thank you in closing the debate on I 'd like to on behalf of the city of Perth and indeed all of the city stakeholders thank these people that have that are about to give up their time and provide the city with what will be incredibly important advice on how we should approach recoveries oh that so I thank you all in advance and hopefully the commissioners will be able to make some of the meetings and make themselves known and I 'm sure we 'll get some good outcomes from it on that basis if there 's no further discussion I 'd put the motion those in photo yes thank you any Commissioner Kasota has gone up for the minutes taker I 'm happy to get center an email of that amended recommendation if that makes it easy thanks to we will take it although it has been recorded so it should be verbatim ah perhaps you 've found I could just be given a a copy of what 's being recorded just before the minutes per published dementia was there a lot thank you thanks okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have given that we 've deferred the order risk committee items to the next meeting of council we now move to motions of which previous notice has been given there are none thank you urgent business no change for some guidance please the deputation with respect to cycling in the city is that something that we can comment on at this point in time yeah it wouldn 't be as part of urgent business detergent business is there for consideration of items and making substantive decisions however those no my understanding there were questions and they and the the person who was asked those questions will be given a written response which will be contained in next month 's minutes would that be correct that 's correct chair yeah so that 's that 's the way that will be dealt with commissioner is does that satisfy your inquiry it was more a comment to make it defer it to another forum you 're very welcome to my comment thing Thank You chair just reflecting on the question and the response there there was the observation that the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cycling support services and cycleways so it was really just a comment or an observation is that this is a little bit of chicken and egg the better facilities and amenity we provide for cyclists then in other jurisdictions that has indicated that you have more cyclists and and vice versa so I think just the need to be aware of how attractive our city is for cyclists and for the need to encourage people to use cycling in order to access the city and to make sure that we do not only meet the demand that 's there now but also future demand thank you okay thanks Commissioner McMath yeah well said co-chair commissioner given the comments being made in a public forum perhaps it could be useful for our general manager of planning and economic development to just give you a very brief update on the work we 're doing at the moment to try and extract funds from the parking fund and we 've identified numerous projects around the city which would enhance the cyclists experience and jason is working on that at the moment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually said everything Murray yes we 're definitely trying to have a more holistic approach to cycling in a city and we 're bringing forward a more complete cycle network through the city irrespective of demand at this point in time I guess we 're either going to be known as a cycling city and accommodating it or we 're not and we 're certainly pushing forward with that program particularly with the spate is supporting the funding that we 're trying to access very good okay and there 's no other business basis declare the meeting closed and thank everybody for their attendance thank you"

land on which we meet the woodruff munger people of western australia and pay my respects to elders past and present it is indeed a privilege to be standing on mujak from our country due to the declaration of the public health emergency and the existence of a state of emergency tonight 's meeting is being held by a video conference and live streamed on the city 's website welcome to all those people that are are viewing the briefing online for the benefit of those viewing the meeting online a list of attendees for this evening 's meeting will now be displayed um ceo do you have any uh apologies for the uh evening 's meeting no chair commissioner uh thank you uh we do have a um disclosure of interest from commissioner kosova relating to the first item on the agenda the uh it 's an impartiality interest and the nature of that interest is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company that plays that for the for the for the record of the meeting thank you um matters for which the meeting may be closed yes we do have one and that 's relating to the confidential item 6.19 memorandum of understanding and so we will go behind closed doors uh at the end of the meeting uh and from here on in we have the offices reports on which commissioners can ask questions and seek explanation so item 6.1 happy heart proprietary limited northbridge precinct the match funding grant for the illuminated streets on commission display thank you chair um my question relates to the sign and whether the total amount requested of 35 000 only covers the sign or whether there are additional activities for seen within this budget allocation uh through your chair can i suggest uh we asked virginia withers our senior sponsorship officer for that response thank you ceo um sorry ceo virginia 's uh not in the meeting but i can definitely answer that one so uh the budget for the recommended budget for this sponsorship would cover the sign only um it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works um that would be in invested by the by the applicant um if i made chair um just thanks tabitha so um 35 is this a good way of delivering this sign value for money for the city noting that the party is not covered except by exceptional circumstances in our policy or is this something that the city could um deliver without this grant um as i as i understand it um it would be value for money because essentially the the whole details of the of the costs have not been fully worked through so for example um it 's based on um a certain proposal that needs to be um done up by like looked at it by an electric electrical engineer a structural engineer so this is really sort of a base cost and any additional costs would be met by the applicant from my experience with these type of projects i think it 's it is quite good value for money but i can take that on notice and provide a more full sum analysis if you like uh now that 's that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i notice it 's i love it by the way um i notice it 's a little bit along the street is that the ideal positioning of the sign or is that as a result of the applicant um location um at the moment the proposal is based on the location of the of the electrical poles which were proposed to be um the support system as i mentioned that still needs to be worked through and the exact final position of of the sign will be um dictated by the struck the structural engineers um report and what what 's feasible within the polls or the heritage fabric around around the sign so i i think there 's a little still a little bit of wiggle room against the exact final location of the sign okay thanks tabitha thank you chair thank you um councillor uh commissioner cassava do you have any uh questions uh yes thank you chair commissioner um as uh commissioner mcmath said i think it 's a great idea i like the uh the sign i think it 's an excellent proposal a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just trying to understand so the sign i 'm guessing is only going to be so when illuminated or when installed is only going to be visible um from a perspective looking north um towards it it 's not obviously going to be double-sided i 'm guessing is that the case that is correct yeah and i couldn 't see anything in the report as to whether the discussions that you 've had with the proponent in this instance have extended as far as who 's going to be responsible for maintenance or repair of the sign should that be required and also for paying the electricity bill to keep it switched on i 'm just wondering if your discussions have gone into those territories um very broadly um the details of that would be need to work be worked out in the sponsorship agreement but we do have a standard precinct development sponsorship contract which holds the sponsorship recipient to all future maintenance um so another example would be the planter boxes that historic heart have delivered for example thank you thanks commissioner okay um i don 't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea as well um item 6.2 um is the revocation of council policy 14.3 the licensing of underage events the commissioners asked for some more detail on this at the last ordinary council meeting so commissioners any uh questions or queries no thank you chair no thank you quite straightforward commissioner casoba okay thank you thank you okay um and once again item six point three at three uh also very similar nature no question shared okay telling from me either uh thank you commissioners okay um the um the next item is the um item 6.4 uh major events 2021 uh 2020 2021 and um firstly i 'd like to uh commend the um staff in bringing forward such a comprehensive uh report uh well done to all concerned uh commissioners um we 'll obviously have some comment on this who would like to start i 'm happy to start chair thank you thank you commissioner um my question relates my first question relates to page 19 uh where we have a table that outlines the financial risk to the city and i note that that includes a cumulative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by way of example the sky works event at at what point would the city need to commit a significant amount of external funding to this project from a from a time point of view so if we were to decide at this point in time based on the information we have to proceed at what point would we need to make a contractual commitment externally or withdraw from it without severe financial penalty to the city uh through youtube could i ask tabitha to respond to that because th there is some um detail that 's important to cover here there 's multiple suppliers not just one supplier and if you 're talking about just the fireworks then that is different to the lead time on all suppliers but if it 's okay with you chair i 'd get tabitha to go into the detail yep thank you thank you chair thank you for the question um so essentially um maria is right there are quite a lot of complicated uh tenders about ten tenders in in total for this event the fireworks component is um 450 000 um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total of 571 000 so in terms of the significant external investment in contractors i suppose when it starts to really ramp up is in september and october by the end of october we 'd be looking at an investment of 200 000 in external contracts and that is based on our assumption that contractors will be willing to enter into contracts with terms of a cost recovery only so essentially that we would say to them there 's a high risk around this event should the event be cancelled we will compensate you for your cost to date so we 've based it on our understanding of what our suppliers typically accrue in terms of expenditure throughout their contract life and um so by end of october we 'd be looking at about 200 000 by end of november um about 390 000 end of december 675 and then the majority obviously around the end of january of course that is all dependent on the terms that the suppliers are actually willing to enter into with the city thank you tabitha chairmayer just have um a follow-up question please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged by the progress we 've made with respect to managing the virus under the leadership of the state government but on this basis of the rapidly changing times and hopefully all for the better i guess in asking that question on the sky works um at most we 're looking at um 200 to 300 000 to buy some time in order to make a final of final decision i noticed uh tabitha in oh and um i really thought that the committee input was really um valuable um especially around the sky works and and the city involvement but i also noted that there was quite a compelling um response to question one around the survey applicant 's willingness to attend an event with more than 100 000 people and that would only be 40 it was would only be on um government advice so it would obviously if it was to proceed would require um it to be consistent with the the latest um advice from the state government um so with respect to those observations um but the input from the committee around if it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee input that could still be incorporated in a proceed decision that will enact will in fact enhance potentially enhance the overall experience and value to the city and through the chair if i may uh we can certainly look into that but it would be at additional cost so the alternative options um are for for australia day um including the the family events trail um the markets the lighting etc and the burak concert the beer at concert is part of the usual um cost for for sky works anyway but all the rest of it um that 's probably about a cost of a hundred thousand dollars so that would be an additional cost um and probably additional staff resources as well and we probably couldn 't do both within the the usual um event team of resources that we have for skyworks um so that would need to be considered um but yes everything 's possible with with with the lead time that we have thank you thank you chair thanks uh commissioner commissioner thank you chair commissioner um through you to either the ceo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair commissioner mcmath 's questions i 'm just wondering if administration is able to further dissect the the skyworks costs tally that 's shown in the table on page 19. so that we can get a little bit more line of sight over the cost components that are attributable to different functions or events that have cumulatively been put under the banner of skyworks recognizing uh what tabitha said earlier that i think it was in the order of around 450 000 has historically been attributed to the actual cost of the fireworks specifically with the total of all other costs um being inclusive of all of the supplementary work and and events that occur on the day so firstly yes if if that could be provided somehow ahead of the council meeting or in the agenda for next week 's meeting i 'd be most grateful for that and through you chair commissioner just a further question i have is i 'm just interested to understand recognizing that when the sky works event was cancelled on the day in 2017 as a result of a tragic aviation accident i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of perth of the cancellation of that event only hours before the fireworks were due to occur and i appreciate if staff don 't have that information at their disposal i 'm happy for that to be taken on notice and uh responded to in due course so thank you thank you commissioner again i 've got a few questions and observations as well um just going back to the uh tabitha if you called the um table relating to the incremental expenditure if you like on page 19. with the skyworks it would be good if we could have um just um appended next to the numbers on skyworks and of july august september october what actually the staff costs were involved along every month of those so we can just get an idea of what is are our embedded costs and also get an idea of what they what actually our goods and services that and obviously the things that are proposing more risk um a couple of other um questions uh that i 've got some comments to make after about these events but i 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new year 's eve it seems to me that whether we have an event or not a lot of people will come into town would that be right but we can 't stop them can we no um yes um if that 's the question then absolutely a lot of people would come into town um which does create a risk for the city if we don 't manage those crowds particularly in the current environment so therefore um if uh let 's look at a scenario of uh given the announcement on monday which in fairness to the staff writing this report they weren 't aware of where we 've gone to phase four and we 're now told that uh the wonderful news that phase five um awaits us all things going well july the 15th um based upon that advice um the um we are probably going to get a lot of people come to town anyway and what concerns me is if we don 't continue to plan and apply resources to new year 's eve i think if western australia has done really well with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a highly celebratory mood and we are going to have a lot of people in town in fact way more than has happened in the past so um i probably suggest that we uh in light of current advice that we need to perhaps rethink that approach because i accept that the report was written um earlier on the other issue with um the christmas nativity scene and i um i well it 's essentially a christmas concept for all intents and purposes i think that 's probably a better way of talking about it but my understanding was that it was originally an event in florence place and um and as a result of the popularity of the event and the size of the event it was relocated to the supreme court gardens is that correct that 's correct yes that 's correct okay um i think given the circumstances of the dire position that our retail areas find themselves in that this could be an opportunity to shift the christmas nativity scene stroke concert back to forrest place now i know that could present some problems but is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could indeed almost reinvent what we 've had to still have a very very christmasy family christmas event in forrest place simply because our retailers need that type of activation and we and i i 'd be much more comfortable um providing that social distancing has left us uh i 'd be much more comfortable in spending the money uh on a forest pace event and look if there was more than if it wasn 't capable of carrying all the people in one night perhaps do it over two nights so the retailers get two lots of people coming in um i i don 't want to put you on the spot tabitha but uh it would be good if the staff could reflect upon that and give us some advice leading up to the council lady um i can do better than that uh chair if you wish i can i can answer that question and the previous ones as well um so um in terms of moving the event back into forest chase we can definitely do that and and we would probably recommend um at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're controlling crowds and having it over multiple nights at probably at least three or four to um to cater for the the the number of crowds that we have currently um the 10 000 people across two nights so um we can absolutely do that and integrate it into the christmas lights trail of course that is what would be a significant cost um as well um probably you know at least the 300 um thousand or more we could get more detail on on exactly how much that would be but certainly something we could consider and feasibly do with ticketing and managing um numbers even if they 're they 're free tickets um so yes for charging for a family concert yeah absolutely yeah um so then in terms of um uh commissioner kosova 's questions um if i may through the chair uh we can absolutely send through a more detailed table um the high level table that was included in the report is a conglomeration of a number of different uh breakdowns including our marketing costs contractors staff time etc so we can send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the detail broken down for that that table no problem um and in terms of the uh cost of the cancellation um when there was the the unfortunate air crash aircraft crash essentially we had to pay 100 costs for that event plus extra to um you know return fireworks that sort of thing so it actually cost us more to cancel on the day than we would have it would have cost us to proceed with the event um and luckily we also did receive our grant from lottery west on um that that year as well otherwise that would have been a significant impasse on the city um in terms of the question regarding new year 's eve and managing crowds um you 'll notice that the alternative um proposal for new year 's eve is nearly the same cost as what we would have normally invested in new year 's eve and that 's largely because of that we really actually can 't control the cost and what we were doing was simply pivoting away from large crowds and gatherings of people and trying to rather collaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to capitalize and cope with the with the crowds within their own venues and and quite likely in the streets through um increased you know open air dining that sort of thing so um definitely options that we could probably should consider regardless of what the situation is um with covid at the time to help uh benefit those local bricks and mortar businesses be my recommendation thanks tabitha um okay just um now just wanted to make um a couple points and and and i 'll be putting forward an alternate motion um for uh the forthcoming the june council meeting and and that 's going to be that we actually do not defer sky works and that we continue planning um to conduct the event doing that on the basis that the commissioners are meeting with the commissioner for police and the chief health officer on thursday to get a a good understanding of what the risks are involved um in in in continuing on with uh with converting this event or facilitating the sedan um but on the basis so that uh there 's a broad acceptance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place then it is impossible with a a crowd of that magnitude to manage and so if things don 't go as well as planned then we are going to have to put in place some type of cancellation regime which leads me to the procurement look i have to say that our suppliers have enjoyed our custom over the years and the time i think now has come for them for one year only to share a bit of risk with the city um and and i 'd like to see our procurement processes weighted to give more weight to those suppliers that are willing to share more risk uh in the likelihood that the event needed to be uh cancelled so um i 'll be i 'll be putting forward that motion nice and early so people can have comment on it but that will also be guided by the advice of the commissioner for police and the chief health officer on thursday in saying that and putting forward that alternate motion that skyworks should continue provided that social disciplining isn 't um in force at that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been quite broad uh and it has been done in some cases independently of the city i note the abc survey um there 's not unanimous support for this event in fact the feedback we 've received from several of our traders our major traders is that they believe the money could be spent elsewhere i don 't believe it 's um the role of the commissioners to be making such a huge policy decision about um taking skyworks off the annual event calendar because that it really is a decision for the council and the lord mayor when they return but i really think they need to have that conversation sooner rather than later and they really need to consult widely to get a really good understanding of the balance needs of the community if you like between our ratepays the best interest of the state and the city 's obligations under the city of perth so i think that the city if we can move forward with this event we can um provide a solution um i don 't believe it will be exactly the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best in the circumstances so um we will have a motion an alternate motion framed and to you by friday lunch time um following our meeting with the chair of the commissioner for police and um their chief health officer just one other thing sorry i forgot to ask and it 's something that um would be good to have some advice on the um the event um is the burak event um which is it i said it right okay which is conducted um adjacent to the sky works once again um a lot of feedback we 've received from our traders is that they get little or no benefit from um events in in langley park or the supreme court gardens i accept the fact that our food and beverage industries do that 's fine um is there an opportunity to to convene the barack event at taurus place uh i 'm not asking for an answer now but um is that a possibility unfortunately chair commissioner thanks for the question um that event is is far too large to fit into forest chase um so yeah it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that just a thought okay so um there 's a bit of work to do for the staff um look i 'll take the hat off to you because you 've got this covered virus that 's changing the rules every 10 minutes yeah but um um but we 'll all need to work together i think to to achieve that so thank you to all the staff that have been involved with that a truly magnificent effort excuse me too uh you excuse me chair your um content was frozen we couldn 't hear you for most of that right is that from everybody oh hell okay that doesn 't matter um can you hear me now yep yes okay oh well it must be a problem with our network okay don 't commissioners have any further comments on that uh no thank you chair okay moving on to the renewal of lease um six point five i have one question and that is looking at the delegation it seems that the ceo has delegated authority to do with this anyone is there a reason why this has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to follow up and check that and get back to you that 's okay and and certainly item three um i don 't think you 'd delegate something that 's already delegated sure yeah no that 's that 's right i 'll follow up for you thanks sorry through you check commissioner on on that particular item and further to um bill 's remarks my reading of it was that it 's proposed to create a new one-off delegation as far as i could establish and that then is being called up in recommendation three so i share your sentiments that if in fact it 's proposed to authorize the to execute the lease if no objections are received during advertising then the simple thing to do would just be to write that into recommendation three save introducing um or relying on an exist or a new delegation which i i 've presumed would then need to be folded into the uh amended delegated authority register that 's referenced in item 6.11. yeah thanks commissioner yeah if you could just check that out and um and take what action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's pretty much the same item isn 't it 6.6 same feedback okay thank you um next item is 6.7 the financial activity statement any comments or queries or questions please uh no thank you chair okay no thank you thank you commissioners um next item is item 6.8 payments from the municipal fund any questions comments or feedback commissioners no no um governance frame work policy um this has come back after consultation with zero response i know um so uh any comments questions or queries on this one uh just to commend the staff for the development of the policy yeah thank you that 's great feedback commissioner okay moving on to 6.10 council policy review commissioners um go ahead len apologies um through you chair commissioner it would just be useful if in the agenda item uh the various tables that are included if the officers could please include the policy number for every policy that 's listed in those tables because at the moment the policy number is missing and just the title of each policy appears so just for transparency and clarity if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioners thank you uh commissioner mcmahon uh thank you chair um just noting the direction of travel on with respect to this really important aspect of governance a thorough review of all the council policies deletion of those that are no longer recovered and appropriate delegation with respect to operational policies um i i i think the other aspect of this is the need for a uh and i believe this has been identified before chair about the need for a process by which all policies are reviewed on a rotational basis to ensure that they remain current and relevant so this is a bit of a cleanup um but it would be good to have a process for um future council thank you thank you commissioner um yeah my sentiments as well um it 's it 's a big joke and so that it needed doing so it 's good to get it underway okay next item is 6.11 the annual review of delegations do apologies um sorry through you chair commissioner i just noticed um bill parker had raised his hand i wasn 't sure if it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these thanks commissioner coster i felt like i 'd missed my opportunity no one was looking but i just wanted to very quickly respond to commissioner mcmath 's comment there around um so within the the most recent policy framework that we adopted we actually applied a risk matrix to all of the policies that then dictate when they 're reviewed so i 'm really confident once we go through this review depending on how highly classified a policy is from a risk perspective we 'll be able to review those in a a very consistent um framework that 's excellent thank you thanks well done bill yeah i 'm sorry for missing your hand up too very remiss of me ryan item 6.11 the um delegated authority register commissioners yes commissioner casoba uh through you chair commissioner the only um request i have of staff is similar to the one i raised on the previous item and that is if administration could please just insert the actual delegation reference number for each delegation that they have listed in the tables appearing throughout this report would make it easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attachments absolutely thank you commissioner thank you bill um commissioner mcmahon no thank you chair no questions okay thank you uh moving on to the next item the um nomination of a commissioner to the mindara uh any questions there no thank you okay we can move on to um the next item which probably the most one of the most significant items that the commissioners will deal with and that 's the corporate business plan i don 't have any questions all i do is have compliments for the staff you 've basically had to deconstruct an entire financial system and and bring forward what is an outstanding document uh an exemplar uh version of what a corporate business plan should be so um well done to all concerned commissioners um just to echo your remarks um the uh paper and the attachment actually with the business plan um succinctly provides um the very essence of a corporate business plan and a way forward i think it 's in the best interest of transparency as to what the um the city 's focusing on and applying funds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this and and i think that the the staff should be very proud of of what 's come forward for consideration by council thank you commissioner uh thank you chair commissioner just supporting the sentiments that you and deputy check commissioner mcmath have expressed um i 'd also just like to add that i think for for an incoming council uh to have this as the as the baseline or the foundation of the corporate business plan that charts the road ahead for the next four years is really going to be a fabulous benchmark and we 'll also allow the council in subsequent years to calibrate or adjust the thresholds of what makes it into or not into the corporate business plan depending on that council 's appetite for scale and cost of projects moving forward so yeah i think it 's uh it 's an excellent framework that will um really support the incoming council with uh with making some strategic decisions in future thank you commissioner uh okay moving on to item six point one four i think i could just say they 're ditto i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand in love with the corporate business plan so um i just i just would hope now that the using the 80 20 rule that 80 of the effort that the council puts into financial planning is done at the corporate business plan level and 20 is applied to the budget which is there to fund the corporate business plan and i 'm sure that the staff that we have will be able to translate that into action in the years to come okay next item is the differential rates public advertising thereof any questions please item 6.15 no thank you chair no thank you commissioners none from me either next item special budget review quarter a quarter four um any questions please uh no thank you thank you okay thank you commissioners um next item item 6.17 um i just had some questions relating to um the the if this has come from the minutes of if this has come from an audit committee meeting should we not um be looking at the minutes of that meeting or um bill can you provide some information on there this all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've raised that um we did have a discussion only minutes before coming into this meeting to that exact effects so um if it 's okay we 'll take that away and undertake a review and make sure that those minutes are presented along with those couple of items that require a decision of council we are working as you would be aware we are working on a revised format for the presentation of those minutes and any subsequent recommendations that come from that committee hopefully that will be implemented by next month okay thanks so we 'll have this back next month after those processes are rented so you don 't want to see those items before those processes are implemented or um well yes we do but i 'm just saying so we will still deal with this okay as a standalone agenda item you 're comfortable with that yeah that 's comfortable with that new process will apply for next month if that 's acceptable right and the the report is silent upon um the audit committee having supported the document so and i note that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and audit and risk committee recommendation um i 'd like to please at least have the the the date of the audit committee and some confirmation that um it was voted upon and uh approved please valid feedback thank you chair thank you other commissioners yes commissioner cassova sorry chair commissioner it 's something 's just um left out at me and i 'm just wondering if um uh when bill is um doing that review could you please also review the appropriateness of on page 118 of the agenda papers on this report under the heading of legal and statutory implications it makes reference to regulation 17 of the local government audit rex i 'm not convinced without having reread them that that 's necessarily the right reference but i 'd be happily happy to stand corrected but if someone could please just um review the the applicability of that would be great absolutely ed thank you um thank you commissioner good pick up okay commissioner mcmahon right okay moving on to the next one items point one eight which is the uh policy fraud and corruption control um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and um has not um been to a briefing session as such is that correct that is is correct chair uh this one was commenced prior to the adoption of the council policy on the format uh that we needed to follow so we can either revert to deal with it in accordance with the current policy or allow it to continue on its current journey i um given that we are um are going to eventually receive the findings and recommendations of the inquiry in the city of perth from commissioner power and the minister i 'd be happier to defer consideration of this until we 've actually seen um those recommendations because i i think we need to respond at a policy level in some way and this may be one of the areas that we need to respond with so uh i 'd i 'd be um i i can move a motion of deferral at the council meeting if you so choose or you could choose to withdraw here that um chair if the feedback of the other commissioners is uh they support your idea we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate time when the inquiry is um recommendations are being considered commissioners are you happy with that approach um chair uh my apologies but my um system froze so i 'm back i assume we 're looking at item 6.18 yes um so i was comfortable um with this policy i think the input to be informed in the plan with all the available information especially the inquiries report is the important aspect of taking this high level commitment into action so it was more around making sure that the plan development was informed um as opposed to a support for having a policy around fraud and and corruption um so i was i was comfortable with the paper as it stood um it was really just the implementation of the plan timing um okay all right um commissioner um anyway we can we can well let 's just let it go through i i 've got some concerns about the way the policy is drafted um okay yeah in the in the what we can deal with that as well in the context of it makes statements about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide a policy position of the city on this oh i see um that that was where i was coming from so um but look we can um keep it on the agenda and we can um and do with this um meeting this next week okay i 'm sorry um chair i hadn 't heard your comments um before i got rejoined it 's probably more appropriate to do it at the meeting anyway to raise those concerns so um great the next item is item 6.19 the confidential item um there is a process i 'm told that we can go behind closed doors electronically uh thank you commissioners and ceo we 've uh now moved out from behind closed doors um i 'd like to to thank um commissioners and ceo and and staff for your valuable feedback and input today and also like to thank the attendance of those in our virtual gallery um for showing the interest in the affairs city of perth thank you thank you all and good evening"

scientist western australia and chair of lottery west can i begin by acknowledging the traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niger would you link it up hello everyone this is the land of the noongar people particularly the wajak clan and i acknowledge their eldest past and present as chair of lottery west can i say how excited i am that we 're making this contribution to an intergenerational park it is so exciting because this is going to be a place of gathering of all sorts of ages and we 're going to have a spectacular facility here in perth it 's fantastic to be here at wellington square in the heart of east perth as part of the new redevelopment we 're seeing an intergenerational playground thanks to a 4.37 million lottery west grant if we want to attract more people to live in our city then we have to make a city for people and that 's about creating amenities facilities and parks that cater to old to young to really attract people here the city is spending 17 million dollars on the wellington square redevelopment project and we 're delighted to have our partners lottery west contribute over four million dollars to this wonderful absolutely world-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people visiting perth but for the east perth residents and and surrounding residents this will be a yet another thing for them to enjoy as part of their wonderful perth lifestyle this is a muddich a wonderful opportunity for the broader community to understand our issues so in developing a memorial site for stolen generation peoples in a significant place in the city is something that 's really been long overdue it 's about reconciliation at its best it 's about truth-telling and i 'm very very pleased that lottery west has been able to contribute almost 4.4 million dollars to this project this intergenerational playground will have lots of features that will appeal to families like a flying fox features for skaters and scooters climbing towers and it will incorporate a west australian theme but also recognize the indigenous culture and heritage that we have in the area this is really an exciting redevelopment for east perth it 's great for the local community and i can 't wait till it opens so apart from adults and the broader community understanding the real issues about aboriginal people the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site is really something we 're going to be looking forward to i 'm really excited [Music] is knees together turn around [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] hi guys this is ryan from two feet and a heartbeat it 's great to be with you again today we 're going to take you on a virtual tour of government house so come and have an explore [Music] so government house is where the governor lives and this isn 't the first government house the first one was actually on garden island and was nothing more than a bit of a canvas tent the second one was set up in the gardens next door in what we now call sterling gardens that was just a temporary one to be built and lived in while a proper state leader house was built which was built on the gardens right here but as soon as it was completed it was just simply not adequate it was lacking in rooms and it had problems with uh rising damp and all sorts of stuff and even a leaking roof so decided to commit build a proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first governor of western australia was james sterling he never lived here the house wasn 't built at that time first governor to move in was hampton these days it 's occupied by his excellency kim beasley and his wife susie annis come and visit [Music] the governor and miss annis are very passionate about advancing the state 's interest and that 's the main purpose of this house to promote the state its advocacy for the place and its people and it 's a living art gallery as well if you have a look there advocates as part of their reconciliation plan highlighting aboriginal artwork as well so scattered throughout the house there is lots of beautiful artwork from around the state and the country [Music] welcome to the ballroom this was a later in addition to the house it is one of the most spectacular places in the city of perth and the acoustics are fantastic they have concert series here regularly should definitely jump on the website of government house to see and come down and experience a show the role of the governor has evolved over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit misunderstood by most people sure there is a ceremonial role there 's lot of entertaining and advocacy for western australia and its people but really importantly we have to remember that we still live in a constitutional monarchy the queen is the head of state she can 't be everywhere and so we have governors as their representative so if a bill is passed at parliament it still needs the queen 's representative to put a signature on it to become law that is the governor and when that happens we have new laws so the role is still vitally important the governor is actually out in the community today engaging down in colley but this is his office where the magic happens so since 1829 we have had 33 governors some you would have heard of some you wouldn 't have heard of or some you might know because of place names so if you 've ever driven down the mitchell freeway there 's mitchell if you ever had to go to sir charles gardiner hospital perhaps charlie gardner if you 've ever traveled up to broome well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever gone surfing at strickland at right next well was named after a governor as well so the names are resonated around western australia very heavily the governor and his wife invite you to come and enjoy the house and the gardens the gardens are open every tuesday wednesday and thursday from 12 till two perfect to grab a cup of coffee and grab your sandwich and enjoy your lunch the house will be open again for open days it 's also the concert series and a whole series of health and wellbeing events like yoga so do check out their website and we hope to see you again in the city someday look us up if you 're after a tour see you next time [Music] when the city first discovered the cobblestones here on pier street the plan was actually non-disturbance archaeology but because a lot of them were going to be destroyed with the footings we 've had to take them up and put them in storage for the moment so we call them cobblestones and everyone 's going to refer to them as cobblestones but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are used as a road surface or an edging but these are act dressed blocks and they come from their granite and we 're pretty sure that they 're coming from the city 's own quarry that was up in the titular valley and that was last used in the 1920s and these cobblestones were to hold the roads together and form a gutter it 's over a thousand cobblestones taken them into storage and we 're going to reuse them in the east end and the plan is we want to engage communities with the history of perth of this area people have asked if we 're expecting to find tram lines along clear street and the answer to our question is no because there 's all our research has shown that there wasn 't any tram lines down pier street but they were downstate georgia 's terrace so we expect if we do work that we will find them along there [Music] [Music] so [Music] hey i 'm aidy from oja today we 're going on a tour of some of the city 's laneways for visit perth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really think to walk down on your own but they 're some of my favorite places to explore in the city back in 2008 the city of perth started a project to revitalize these laneways and they turned them from these really dull unsavory boring spaces to really bright colorful and exciting spots to explore we 're now walking into grand lane named for the grand theater that was once on this site this used to be a really dull underutilized thoroughfare but it 's now a really bright burst of color and life back in 2010 two artists and 600 spray cans transformed this boring wall to an epic 99 meter long mural elements of the mural reflect west australian birds as well as the old grand theatre that used to be here and there 's loads of other amazing murals in the laneway as well if all this exploring has made you hungry you can come check out one of the many awesome venues around i recommend the legendary toast face griller named after ghostface killer of the wu-tang clan and they 've got the best damn toasties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lane now you 'd easily walk right past here and never know but there 's some amazing things to see in the laneway there 's a few things that they 've installed to entice you in and make it a little bit more inviting the first thing is this strip of different material down the middle of the laneway kind of actually draw you in so if you do see a lane with a strip down the middle it 's kind of like the yellow brick road you should follow it the second thing to look out for is light here they 've got an artist to make these awesome chandeliers that not only look really cool but they light up at night time so you feel quite safe to walk down here there 's also some amazing street art to see here in howard lane we 've got murals by two of first most iconic street artists like this amazing piece by stormy mills and this bold colorful piece by the yacht around the same time of this layme revitalization project new liquor laws came into play which meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laneways and the small bars they go so well together it 's really great to be able to come down and explore these areas and find hidden gems like helvetica here you never know but there 's an amazing small bar through these doors it 's a whiskey bar that has hundreds of whiskeys from all around the world and super friendly and knowledgeable staff to help you with the best choice [Music] another one of my favorite city laneways is prince lane here some stunning artwork including this bright colorful mural that runs the entire length of the laneway it 's reflecting the fashion industry in the area so beautiful to walk down here so next time you 're in town i really recommend instead of just walking down those main city streets that you always go down come explore some of these awesome laneways instead [Music] hi guys this is ryan from [Music] hi guys this is ryan from two feet and a heartbeat i 'm going to take you on a virtual tour of london court today on behalf of the city of perth so come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um yes well we 've moved out from behind closed doors and um i 'd um i like to advise that firstly the um there were two motions that were dealt with behind closed doors the the motion relating to the subject matter will remain confidential uh until such time uh as um certain announcements are made uh in a public forum as to the subject matter and and secondly the other motion that was dealt with was the motion to move from behind behind closed doors on that basis there being no further business to discuss i thank those all in attendance and"

Ransome will certainly be considered in the preparation of the cities exemption policy thank you thank you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deputations no further questions or deputations chair Commissioner thank you sir we move on to item five on the agenda which is applications for leave of absence commissioners do we have any applications for leave of absence no chair Thank you Thank You commissioners moving on to item six confirmation of the minutes firstly of the ordinary council meeting of the 26th of May 2020 could I please have a mover after me sir Thank You Commissioner McMath I 'll treat that as being approved or do we have anything yet okay thank you motion is carried I note the orden ordered and Risk Committee minutes have been placed on here for noting only could I please have a mover please for Low 's happy to move move thank you well is there any feedback on those minutes no chair Thank You commissioners I 'll put that to the vote all those in favor thank you they carried three zero next item item seven announcements by the chair Commissioner and today the CEO and myself attended the closing of the city of Perth Inquirer and we heard the closing remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commissioners looked forward to receiving in due course a copy of the Inquirer 's report and an will take action accordingly I think it timely though in the context of what 's on the agenda today and some of the comments that Commissioner power made that we link the two and to quote commissioner power many of these poor decisions were the result of poor governance practices at the city which was set against the background of widespread cultural and systemic failings and as a result the city was in many ways a dysfunctional and inefficient organization the inquiry uncovered a number of instances where the administration failed to identify prevent properly investigate adequately report and then act on misconduct compounding the governance failures across many levels and the administration was a woeful failure to properly plan for the city 's future and manage its finances adequately these were important responsibilities which the administration needed to discharge well it did not do either well and but for this inquiry probably would have continued to do so largely unnoticed there was too much far too much importance given to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far too little importance given to actual planning and financial management for the benefit of the city and its community now whilst much will be said and and much follows as to the the nature and substance of the report and the recommendations and finding thereon I think it 's important to link those statements with the agenda items that we will be considering seeming and and I and I firstly point to item 13 point 9 which is the adoption of the governance framework policy which certainly provides for a best practice approach to governance in local government commissioners would also be aware that a a policy on the city 's policy framework has been adopted and is in operation and commissioners would also be aware that a policy on the city 's strategic framework has also been adopted and in operation more importantly items thirteen point three one three and thirteen point one four C the city this evening about to adopt its first ever and I 'll call it proper corporate business plan in my view they the city has gone from a void in strategy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance with the corporate business plan in the long term financial plan this was demonstrated to me by the way the city could provide information to the commissioners in relation to the development of the twenty million dollar covered response plan without the dissection of those this section of expenditure in revenue that was available in the business plan that would have not been achievable on top of that council tonight will be considering the adoption of a fraud and corruption control policy and once again a best practice approach to providing a framework for the prevention of fraud and corruption whilst the city has much work to do with regards to responding to the past state of the organization I 'm confident that I can say on behalf of the commissioners that significant progress has been made and for that I acknowledge and thank the CEO my fellow commissioners Commissioner McMath Commissioner Kesava I also acknowledge the light Commissioner Eric lumsden for his fine efforts and also acknowledged staff who over the last two years have made a considerable effort to turn this organization around in what have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much on behalf of the city of Perth moving on to the next item on the agenda is disclosure of members interests and we do have one interest and impartiality interest from Commissioner Kesava in relation to the item from happy heart proprietary limited and commissioners can serve as an impartial one so therefore he will be involving himself in debate discussion and in voting thereon are there any further interests to declare through through you chair Commissioner could I please just add a point of clarification in that item eight of the agenda papers towards the start of the agenda briefing or the agenda council papers outlines the nature of my interest in this matter as being an impartiality interest because I have had a past business relationship with happy heart limited proprietary yeah just to clarify that 's not the case the disclosure that I made at last week 's council briefing on this item was an impartial disclosure on the basis that one of the founders of happy heart proprietary limited Adrian Finney is also involved with fjm property which was previously a client of my consulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarifying that and we 'll obviously ensure that is ensconced in to the minute Thank You Commissioner McMath any interest to the plan and no chair no current interest whatsoever thank you questions by members of which new notice have been given CEO there are none to Commissioner C correspondence relating to items on the agenda no chair Commissioner petition C no cheer commissioner matters for which the meeting may be closed I I understand that we do have one item thirteen point one nine the consideration of the Memorandum of Understanding which we will deal with at the end of the meeting I think

Forest place concerts Christmas concerts three hundred thousand dollars Australia Day fireworks celebrations two million dollars Christmas decorations other reactivations and East End revitalization three point six eight million dollars that adds up to a total covered response program of twenty point one one five million dollars which we are fortunate to be able to include those major events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I have a seconder for the motion please happy the second Thank You Commissioner Macbeth Miche commissioners just for the record can I please have clarified whether I misheard through the reception but I am clear on your intent my understanding is the second line of the table you called out 1.9 million versus one point nine zero five million and it surely 1.05 correct and the second last line I heard three point six eight million and the figure is three point six eight five million yeah you 're correct see as always right leadoff firstly by saying the whilst the Australia Day sky works event has been the the the issue that has created the most community response I think it 's really important to understand the the scale and breadth of this response that the city has developed for covin and I I 'd like to acknowledge the efforts of the staff because they were asked probably two months ago to rub out all their discretionary expenditure and then come back to the list of programs that were reallocated at totally full Coburn 19 response now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary in appropriate and to the staff that worked so hard to come up with those items particularly Michael Kent in terms of bringing all the numbers together right I certainly thank you but I 'll just say one other thing in the in the context of the consideration of skyworks when this report was originally written the office of concern was probably working from home wearing a mask because of that stage the covert lockdown was well and truly upon us even when the report we are currently reading was written the officers were unaware of the lifting of the phase four restrictions and it indeed it wasn 't until Friday morning which is in terms of business days three working days ago that the commissioners were able to draft up an alternate motion and that followed an extremely important informative and important meeting with the commissioner for police and the chief health officer relating to the risks involved with the city [Applause] facilitating the event so look the commissioners Abril I am comfortable now that with the conditions we 've got in place that the council when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running the city of Perth that we have not exposed them to any inordinate or unnecessary risk short this event have to be cancelled as a result of of covin returning to the city and let 's all hope that that does not happen so I think I think it 's a good result for all I would like to thank and acknowledge the assistance of the Commissioner for police and the chief health officer in meeting with myself Commissioner McMath then Commissioner cassavetes at short notice it certainly gave us the Gravatar to come forward with a and effective and as far as I can see reasonably risk-averse motion Thank You Commissioner McMahon thank you chair and chair endorse your sentiments precisely I think that we 're still in rapidly changing times and what we have done in approaching the decisions around the three significant events is to provide the best possible situation should events prevail that these are unable to go ahead so obviously safety is first and and and of priority and we will and I 'm sure future counselors in making any decision country or supportive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to say that I think the list of activities that have now been identified will make the CBD a vibrant and the place to be for public free events across the whole metropolitan Perth and warmly invite all citizens to come back into their city knowing that it is safe and there will be something exciting and new to participate in for families so thank you very much Thank You Commissioner Kesava Thank You chair Kamisha I wholeheartedly support the sentiments that yourself and Deputy Chair Commissioner McMath have raised and look without prolonging the discussion and ventilating more of the comments that have otherwise been said already or included in the report I would I would simply like to highlight that the the scale and the gravity of the Australia Day celebrations in my view needs to be kept into perspective notwithstanding its its popularity and its its legacy I think it 's worth noting that it constitutes 10% of the overall operating budget expenditure that has been allocated or is proposed to be endorsed through this motion for recovery and rebound initiatives I think it will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city is actually cemented and to continue on the historical success of the skyworks celebrations and I think it 's going to be perfectly complemented here a very diverse offering of other attractions and activations and events that as Deputy Chair Commissioner McMath said should rightly cause people to come back to the city in droves so yes thank you for that alternative and I wholeheartedly support it Thank You Commissioner casaba look in closing the but I just like to add one final point and that is I think it 's appropriate that we we declare that we received some significant opposition to running the event and there certainly is not Universal support from city ratepayers or residents for these skyworks event at city of perth for a range of reasons now as commissioners we agreed that we would be making decisions based on covert and certainly not based upon other decisions but given the amount of very varied feedback we 've had from city stakeholders I think it is incumbent upon the incoming Lord mayor and councillors to have a discussion with their community and their stakeholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide on the way forward what is the most appropriate way firstly wished to expend two million dollars of city money and and secondly on the celebration of Australia by itself on that basis I 'd like to close the debate and put the motion those in favor Thank You commissioners motion is carried 3 0 right now we 'll move back to the agenda and we go to items and thirteen point five renewal of lease commissioners do we have I 'm over please happy to move chu Thank You Commissioner McMath second up Commissioner Cassano and any any discussion No if not I 'll put the motion all those in favor three zero Thank You commissioners next item 13.6 new lease communication tower his majesty 's carpark do I have a mover Thank You Commissioner casaba do I have a seconder Thank You Commissioner McMath is there any discussion on the item if not I 'll put the motion those in favor motion is carried item thirteen point eight financial activity statement for the period ended 30th of April 2020 commissioners do I have a murder Thank You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that item no thank you to if not I 'll put the motion those in favor thank you item 13.8 payments from the Lea a municipal fund May 2020 can I have a mover please Thank You Commissioner Kesava a seconder please thank you Commission to make mouth any discussion on that item No thank you Thank You commissioners if not I 'll put the motion those in favor motion is carried 3 0 next item governance framework policy can i this has been out for public consultation we didn 't receive any response do I have a moment please Thank You Commissioner casavatore I have a seconder Thank You Commissioner McMath is there any discussion or comment yes Commissioner casada Thank You cheeky Mishler look I just really like to commend the work that has gone into developing this policy framework or the governance framework policy I think it provides an excellent basis for dramatically enhancing the processes and practices at the city and I think the the policy objectives and scope that I set out in this governance framework policy really just speak for themselves to ensure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Perce I commend the policy and the efforts of staff in putting it together Thank You Commissioner Commissioner Macbeth Thank You chair and chair I would like to add to my fellow commissioners support for this policy but chair I 'd like to take the opportunity that in addition to all those individuals that you cited as contributing to this new approach of governance encapsulated in this policy that we also acknowledge your personal contribution and leadership on this matter your experience as a CEO local government CEO has been represented in your leadership and that this governance policy in spades and I think the city of Perth will be well-placed going forward so thank you on behalf of everyone cheer commissioner Thank You Commissioner Macbeth you 're too kind thank you I 'd just like to just some closing comments those three cornerstone policies of effective local government strategy policy and governance I 'm I 'm really comfortable now that as commissioners we have gone a long way in setting that basis for good decision making which is so important okay I 'll put that motion those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the agenda is the council policy review on 13.10 do I have a mover please Thank You Commissioner Cassano Thank You Commissioner McMath any comments no yes thank you Thank You chair look I think the only comment I 'd like to make is the need to be ever vigilant in the approach of making policies for everything but not necessarily for the right things so I think that this process has been one where we 've been able to get a full list of all the policies and methodically have a process in place of those that are truly council policies and those that are operational and those that shouldn 't be policies at all so again I think this is a really significant step forward in simplifying and clarifying and focusing on what 's important as a policy for the city thank you wise words Thank You Commissioner Kesava Thank You Jay Commissioner look I just like to emphasize that this is the policy policy framework at play here insofar as we about to consider a decision to advertise for 21 days the proposed deletion of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report I think that in itself is a great step forward and provides a very hard degree of transparency and consistency in how the city will deal with review manage or supersede its policies moving forward so I would encourage anyone who has any opinions or concerns or comments to raise on this issue to familiarize themselves with the policies they are all listed in numerical order in table 2 they 're all available on the city 's website and if there are any concerns regarding the proposed deletion of those then then would be a good time to raise them thank you okay boys words as well so on that basis I 'd put them all those in favor place motion is carried 3-0 we move on to the next item on the agenda which is thirteen point one one the annual review of delegations do I have a mover please oh thank you can we stomach Matt yeah Thank You Commissioner Cassano then is there any discussion on the delegations yeah Thank You Commissioner Kesava Thank You chief commissioner could I please just get a degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GM bill two of the items that we considered earlier item 13 point 5 and item 13 point 6 in the version of those reports that was presented to the council briefing last week the recommendations included reference to delegating certain powers to the CEO to to approve the various leases if no comments were raised during advertising I were just like administration 's confirmation please that the reason that there was not those same recommendations included in items thirteen point five and thirteen point six tonight is because they those that Authority has been bundled up and be included in the new delegations that are before us now Murray would you like me to handle that one go through the chair and Commissioner Koster thank you very much for the question that is absolutely correct I guess we could almost look at considering taking point two out of those items as well but moving forward absolutely they will be bundled up as a result of the revised delegation schedule there 's a lot of those land transactions under 50,000 that fall within a certain threshold of the market value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agenda it will happen under delegated authority and provide a far better and higher level of service to our community and stakeholders sort of be a good outcome thank you I cry any further discussion no check out put the emotion sorry those in favor mason is carried 3-0 next one is the nomination of a commissioner to the Mandara Regional Council I would like to move that Commissioner cassava be nominated to that position I 'd be happy to second that chair Thank You Commissioner McMath there any does Commissioner Kassar you happy of that nomination yes thank you I have to confess that I 've actually really enjoyed my participation as a voting member of MRC very good well that might continue so on that basis no discussion I 'll put the motion those in favor motion is carried next imaginations thank you yes Commissioner Cassano now you enjoy corporate business plan item thirteen point one three look I 'd like to have the privilege of moving that motion do I have a second to place Thank You Commissioner McMath I have said some things about the corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city has gone from essentially zero to hero with this document it is clear it is a fantastic we 're working document it clearly represents what the financial position of the is of the city it also clearly represents the way forward in the way we are translating the vision and aspirations of our strategic community plan into the programs services and infrastructure that that vision provides for once again I 'd like to acknowledge Michael Kent and another offices but Michael has certainly led this the reality star Michael you 've had to deconstruct our entire accounting system rather there and started again and for that not only the commissioners but the entire city should be eternally grateful for your skill and efforts so thank you and and could I please have that acknowledged in the minutes commissioner McMath still having audio problems Commissioner McMath can you hear me I 'm sorry chair I 'm my apologies for the disruption I was having a small technical glitch nothing really to add except to say how delighted I am that we 're able to approve this and encourage everyone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides absolute clarity and transparency into the city of Perth and its new DNA for the way we go about doing business allocating responsibilities and focus and hence resources Thank You Commissioner Kesava Thank You JC I think the CEO beat me I was sorry Commissioner kassover but through your chair just again for the public record and I appreciate your acknowledgment of Michael Kent and all the work he 's done on it but I wouldn 't want it to go unnoticed that a lot of the corporate business plan and I know Michael would want the same was driven by a project director of corporate recovery Karen Strachan and I was elected and the two of them have made an incredible difference in this space hanky my apologies Karen I had you written down here but I didn 't read that you know my apologies okay Commissioner Cassano Thank You chair Commissioner look without being too repetitious in my commentary I would say again that having having reviewed and revised and created a number of corporate business plans have been involved therein I would say that this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming counsel and the administration over the next four years recognizing that it is a rolling four year plan it 's not a static document so there is ample opportunity for the incoming counsel to adapt and respond in a very nimble fashion to any issues or opportunities that they will see on the horizon and any challenges ahead of them it is a brilliant document for the operational delivery of the goals aspirations and directions that have been espoused in the strategic community plan and I would say to any prospective or potential council member or lord mayor candidate I would really encourage them to rifle through this document read it to critically assess and understand what it what it is seeking to do because it is a very comprehensive road map for the key actions activities that the city will be focusing on for the next four years but not so much so as to create a structure of such rigidity for the incoming council as to cause any inflexibility for them in as I said previously shifting and adapting to opportunities and issues that come along so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it 's a tremendous team effort that the city has put together to craft this document and I think it perfectly captures the way forward for the city now thank you thank you thank you without saying anything further I 'd like to put the motion noise in favor motion is carried next item is 13.1 for the long-term financial plan look once again I like to move that and do though my comments do I have a seconder please happy the second chair thank you dare any further discussion No thank you chew um thank you I 'll put that those in favor thank you motion is carried next item on the agenda 13150 advertising the differential rates for the forthcoming year and do I have a mover please Thank You Commissioner cassava a second to please Thank You Commissioner McMath any discussion on that okay thank you I 'll put that motion those in favor most is carried 3 0 next item on the agenda is thirteen point one six the special budget review do I have a mover please Thank You Commissioner Kesava do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any discussion on the budget review not not from each other yes self-explanatory thank you thank you on that basis I 'll put the motion those in favor motion is carried thank you commissioners next item is item 13 point one eight the council policy fraud and corruption controlled or I have a mover please sorry chief Commission was at thirteen point one seven sorry Commissioner thirteen point one eight the fraud and corruption Control Policy so I think we skip it Hammond and thirteen point one seven the auto planned my apologies commissioners and staff thirty-nine point one seven the city of Perth internal audit

favor motion is carried can I see your hand Commissioner thank you thank you motion is carried three zero next item 13.1 8 the policy on fraud and corruption control door I have a mover please happy to move chair Thank You Commissioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just just to reiterate I think this is an important step forward we still got some more work with respect to the detail around implementation thank you thank you Commissioner Chadda through YouTube Commissioner only to reiterate someone earlier comments about the policy management framework that 's now been implemented firstly it 's it 's absolutely essential in this day and age for a local government particularly the capital city to have a policy like this in place so well done talk and so they 're noting that it was considered at the audit and Risk Committee on the 6th of May and also noting that the policy in its draft form as received this evening is intended to be advertised for a 21 day public consultation period so again would encourage anyone with feedback on this issue to provide that during the advertising process Thank You Commissioner on that basis I 'll put the motion those in favor motion is carried 0 commissioners with your approval I 'd like to go to the too late items and leave the confidential item to last does that accept a book yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 point 2 0 which is operation heat shield which and essentially their recommendation is that the council approve the setting of a letter to the the premier of Western Australia seeking his assistance in extending operation heat shield mama happy to move that motion and on the basis that we have already had some discussions with the Commissioner for police so do I have a seconder please happy the second chair Thank You commissioner they need to further discussion on that motion no chip if none I 'll put the Martian those in favor thank you most is carried 3-0 next item is the item thirteen point two one the reinstatement of parking fees and I 'm actually happy to move that motion I 'd also like to acknowledge the work of Nathan Hearn and his team for putting together such a comprehensive report in in these in these times when the staff have been under so much pressure so I put I certainly support his recommendation and so I 'm happy to move it do I have a second to please Thank You Commissioner casaba starting off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal but the approach that is being taken is incremental it extends the the very popular parking trials the up to one hour three and a half streets and weekend in public holiday up to three hours in the CBD and so what we all need of course is to the people that were commuting prior to kyvan to start commuting again so that 'll free up some of the space of these parking stations for our retail customers thank you do I go ahead should I have a seconder yeah that was me do you have anything to look again commend the officers involved in pulling this together I think it 's a great report it summarizes well the position and and the outcomes arising from the work that was previously done in the parking area and I also support the recommendations I think it 's good Thank You Commissioner Macbeth Thank You chair I 'm I agree this is a matter of balance balancing the parodies of different stakeholders and I believe that it is time to move back to a business as usual think thank the citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can get the city back and actually begin with shoppers as well as workers in using the cowpox thank you thank you thank you okay if that 's the case then I 'll put the motion those in favor boast is carried 3-0 I 'd now like to move that we move behind closed doors to discuss your confidential item please [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you moving out behind closed doors the motion that was given giving consideration will remain confidential and be released in due course the other motion of course was that we move out from behind closed doors there is no urgent business so on that basis I would like to thank everybody in attendance for tonight 's meeting particularly those in our virtual gallery and declare the meeting closed at 00 p.m. thank you all [Music]"

corner of Murray Street and Thomas Street West earth in mid 2019 from the state government since that time fat cot has been working with urbis and kotti Parker to develop plans for a supermarket led mixed-use development over the side the development will contain a full line Woolworths supermarket a small number of specialty stores and potentially offices above and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development will deliver the first and only full line supermarket for the West Perth community servicing existing and future residents and businesses and the emerging CBS redevelopment area many existing residents must leave the city boundaries to areas such as Subiaco to fulfill their grocery needs access to a full line of supermarket is essential to achieving the city 's residential growth aspirations and the development will activate and build out a prominent vacant site at a major entry point to the city in order to progress to a development application a scheme amendment is required to enable retail land users and for sufficient plot ratio to be available to accommodate a viable development the project team has been working collaboratively with city officers for several months and the recommendation in the agenda is supported fully fat kaat is eager to commence this major development as soon as possible and the timely progression of the scheme amendment is an essential component to the development program it is respectfully requested that the commissioners support the officer recommendation and finally the project team is looking forward to working with city officers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is available to brief the commissioners or respond to any questions taken on notice as required thank you Oshin and I I note that the the officers are supportive of initiating the amendment so on that basis commissioners do you have any feedback comments or requests for further information please not for me Commissioner McMahon I think seeing this sort of development in the city is to be encouraged yeah thank you very much those comments by totally agree on that basis we 'll move on to item 6.3 a similar type of proposal for a special control area where are we relict and straight 482 484 and lot 66 Murray Street Perth do commissioners and any comments feedback or requests and further information and no thank you thank you not for me thank you on that basis I 'll move on to the next item which is the city of Perth Community Care program on page 19 and I 'll just bring that one up on my agenda I do have some feedback on that one commissioners do you have any feedback advice or requests for information on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm referring to the attachment 6.4 a on that commences on page 191 of the agenda yep referring to page 204 of the agenda I was encouraged to see the reference to the excuse me I 'm just finding that on my electronic agenda now the reference to the expand expansion of the assertive outreach services in the city of Perth and this indicates an increase of a point to FTE at a cost of 50,000 and so my question is I understand this is a trial but given the extent of the issues that the city experiences with rough sleeping weather this is a sufficient allocation of resources for this for this issue thank you Yahoo would you direct time that question so please and I believe general manager Community Development might be best placed or Emma Thank You chair Commissioner I might ask Emma to respond to this level of detail thank you thanks Joe commissioner thanks Commissioner for your question I just clarify the point to isn 't new resources within the existing resources of the city of Perth really the intent of the 50,000 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant reduction in services that were being provided in the city at the time so it was really to respond to that quickly and on this side of the financial year we will then provide or use the information from that trial to inform a wider assertive outreach program that 's been identified in the interim city 's homelessness plan and that will come to commissioners at a later date through the chair thank you very much Emma just a I suppose a comment if I may I 'm looking forward to that paper I think that the assertive outreach support service is absolutely essential and if we are able to demonstrate the impact and our comes from that then seeing greater level of resources to assertive outreach across all local governments here in Perth alone could make a substantial difference so I look forward to the paper I look forward to the outcome of the pilot and a strategy of response thank you Thank You Commissioner Cassano did you have any man that you wish to rise through you chief commissioners for the avoidance of doubt just to clarify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actions defined in section 7 of the attachment the Emma or and close so sorry through the chief a number of these have actually already been implemented so they 've been implemented with existing within existing budget and resource also through redeployment of some staff from facilities [Music] Oh cheer I think you might be on mute that I find thanks Mary are you happy with that response Commissioner yes thank you thank you the guy had just a request with some information please one page 22 of the report with regards financial implications look like put again the budget is not the financial implications moving down the budget is putting down the budget the financial implications are actually how much it 's going to cost to develop develop the plan which I would have thought is not the total budgets for those two is that correct sorry I thought the the budget is within the financial implications is that to implement the plan yes but what I 'm saying now is that the budget is different it actually how much this plan might cost it 's the financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does next we say what the cost is because the cost can be different to the budget in fact it normally would be I might need to take that one on notice and get back to you if that 's okay thanks thank you you understand where I 'm coming from yeah no I do understand so I 'll take it on notice thank you very much that 's great okay there 's no further questions on that item can we please move forward to item 6.5 the review of policy eighteen point one three sponsorship and grants commissioners no question thank you Jim soda I don 't three of you mr. chair probably not so much a question more an observation which staff may or may not to to address in the report prior to the council agenda being finalized for next week and that is that I noticed that one of the provisions introduced in the or proposed to be introduced in this policy as the very last clause from memory is a prohibition against canvassing of councilors it might be worth addressing or canvassing that issue through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit more clarity around what that might look like to provide further guidance for applicants of sponsorships and grants so that they don 't inadvertently overstep the mark because I think they might be very well intentioned might speak to a future councilmember that they 're familiar with and and that might land them in hot water and eliminate them from further consideration with without anticipating that that could be the result so I just think it might need a little bit more guidance or explanation either in the agenda reporter in the policy itself through the chair Commissioner will take that on notice and see if we can come back with some better clarification in the policy for the council meeting thanks commissioner and I 've got a couple of points and one was just for the recommendation we 're not endorsing changes to a draft policy we 're actually changing a policy which then becomes the draft policy so really these type of recommendations or motions should be that where we 're endorsing the draft policy for the purposes of community consultation and the item 2 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertised so there 's no point for the council to approve that because the if we go up the page where policy references are that is where the statement should be made that the proposal will be advertised for 21 days okay next one is page page 30 the policy the motor vehicle and transport services for the Lord Mayor do we have any requests or advice or informational comments please through the chair I do have a comment if I may referring to page 28 the paper appropriately says that the community may expect that the vehicle and travel arrangements available to the Lord Mayor would reflect an appropriate level of dignity and respect for the role and then following is a number of ways of responding to that could I also suggest that the policy needs to take into account convenience and I think that 's what 's anticipated with respect to say an evening function in being able to arrange a service from one 's home to the event and then back again not just from council house but most importantly of all reflects the consideration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure and for that plan and for that purpose identifies the appropriate level of recognition that in the past has been on the meril vehicle that inning that in my opinion really attracts attention to that car as opposed to enhance dignity but may provide also some security and safety issues as well so getting that balance right with safety and security being the most important thing for the mayor and any future councillor thank you thanks commissioner so that no I 'm fine thanks chica sure thank you I 've got a couple of comments firstly page 28 the just about where it says personal use a lot some clarification on that it says the Lord Mayor should have the ability to choose alternative transport arrangements from what are they more cost-effective than the policy provisions well we 're establishing a policy will be speaking the Lord Muir to be acting within the provisions of that policy whether that statement has another intent or there 's a typo in it I don 't need it now but would appreciate some type of explanation pride of the matter being given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you we will arrange that Bill Parker general manager of Corporate Services will follow that up thank you also page 30 the financial implications with relation to the service cost of providing a vehicle of drivers the Lord Mayor fine where it says the new policy will provide a reduction in operating costs we need actually to estimate what those costs will be not saving will be why I don 't think it 's appropriate just to say there will be a saving without actually quantifying what they 're saving might be once again that will be 4 bill would it see ya there correct you and we 'll pick both of those items up for the council meeting all right thank you the last one once again no need to have that it 's approved consultation there 's a requirement to do that now so if we can just change that top one to be in dorset extra for purposes of community consultation that would be good thank you right moving on to the next item six point seven council policy review commissioners Thank You Commissioner Cassano please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure if administration will have sufficient time to address my question on this particular issue but that is really noting that there is scant level of information or explanation included in the report as well as an absence of any descriptive attachment that would fully explain and justify not necessarily the retention of council policies because I think that 's quite straightforward but rather for members of the community as well as administration and future incoming counsel to understand the rationale behind the reclassification of council policies to executive policies as well as the prospective deletion of council policies ordinarily with something like this there might be a fairly comprehensive matrix prepared that provides that level of detail and justification and my view is that that is going to be necessary information to be provided in order for commissioners to make an informed decision on this matter Thank You Commissioner Cassano Commissioner McMath Thank You chair just to add my support to the comments made by my fellow Commissioner Thank You Commissioner McMath you so I 've got some input on this to look and the commissioners don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the responsive but we certainly do need in tables two and three the reasons why essentially all of those policies will be deleted as council policies the ones that are going to an executive policy once they 'd believe that they being a council policy the council has no right to direct that their executive policies because that is the role of the CEO to make that determination so in effect table two and three are the same the council is losing control of those policy items from what are obviously very good reasons what we need to know is what the reasons are okay so if you can 't make it at this council meeting I guess as as Commissioner cassava says we 'll need to make it at the next one okay thank you sorry is through the chair sorry apologies but may I just add to that for the for the guidance or benefit of council staff that I think also that information perhaps needs to address the fact that the the deletion or reclassification of a policy also does not mean that the the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given due regard or no no longer be effectively managed by the city things like directional signs road safety management of leases website content all of those things will still happen as is the ordinary course of business in local government but I think it just needs to be addressed for the purposes of clarity that some of those policies if they are seen to be redundant will be set aside but the actions that are otherwise describing those policies may occur in one form or another still thank you thank you Commissioner that 's good see I 've got enough direction there I guess yeah right okay the next item on the agenda is item 6.8 the national redress scheme the commissioners have any feedback comments or more information requests for this item no thank you chair okay same here thank you for that the next item is the reserve cancellation at rain square development and so once again I I would have thought that this was an item that clearly could be delegated but in the in the interim does anybody have any questions or comments feedback no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one on board perhaps um to have a look at that type of thing and see if you can the star can get delegated authority because it actually speeds up the development of process as well our degree chair and again bill I 'm sure we 'll pick that up through governance thank you thank you okay the next item is item 6.10 financial contribution the Perth constable temporary works commissioners have had an extensive briefing on this front of this side do we have any comments feedback or request for further information refer to the western Symphony Orchestra in my impartiality interest I beg your pardon that should have been with respect to the Perth international Arts Festival fine if the government 's to take that on board thank you so any feedback comments advice no thank you no okay thank thank none for me either that 's good matter result I believe the next council meeting item 6.1 one the financial activity statements for the period ended 31st of March OH no question thank you Thank You commissioners none from me either payments from the municipal fund April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah no I was gonna try and be cute and frame it as a question but I was simply observing that it 's good to see expenditure going ahead on Wellington Square and has been nice work yeah feedback right next item is item 6.1 three they covered 19 recovery and rebound activities prior to us getting into the the process of seeking further information I would like to provide a request of staff and essentially make a statement in the same situation that looks upon the contents of the report and strategy which is extremely good work in the circumstances and with the pressures that are been placed upon all the staff so we 'll go into more concern however the three items that are three items that are contained in the report being the Australia Day sky show the Christmas nativity concert and the New York New York eaves event are events that have been taken place for many many many years and therefore require in my view a greater depth of analysis and consideration that then would be a for that other matters within in the strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehensive report to be prepared the consideration by commissioners at the June council meeting on the feasibility or otherwise of delivering these events that 's the three events I mentioned specifically in December 2020 January 2021 this is the following information that I think needs to be in the report so as the commissioners can make an informed and considered decision first one is the predicted impacts of Cobert No Dean at that time based upon advice from the whe felt officer and the state government covered 19 roadmap secondly the lead time that is required for each event to be effectively planned and delivered the third item is the financial risks involved in proceeding with project planning and securing context for goods and services if as a result of covert not only events through nor not per se but simply we need to know how much this risk is likely to cost the the next item is alternatives for the delivery of similar events of a smallest scale should the current uncertainty on the future impacts of covin 19 reduce lead times for planning in the procurement of goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times means smaller events the history of each event including patronage changes to event scope over time the cost of the city and contributions from project partners and sponsors over time the next one is the economic return of each event in comparison to other City delivered events and I understand the staff have access to quite sophisticated economic measurement tools that can provide a great deal of quantification and advice on this subject matters the social benefit of each event alignment with state government postcode recovery plans and community and stakeholder feedback including feedback from the WI police the some of these events I 'm not sure how long the nativity scenes been going on for the nativity cuts but the the sky works I think started as the 96 FN sky works in the early 80s obviously a much different base to what it is now so it 's really important that commissioners have all of this advice if they are going to make considered decisions and and the decision as to whether these are might or might not go ahead is Coburn related and so therefore as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimation and predictions from those experts in the know to to guide our decision-making process we 'll need to wait to June that 's the way it has to be given the enormity I think of the collection of the data that all of the choir so commissioners do you have any other feedback or comments on matters outside of those three issues that we 've sort of a separate report on I know thank you to additional information will be welcome yeah Commissioner casaba know wholeheartedly Bree thank you and I 'd reiterate that our congratulations from the commissioners for the fine work that has been done in varying trying circumstances leading up to the provision of this report and I look forward to a more extensive report at the June meeting on that basis see any further comments or questions or reflections I 've definitely always got plenty of those but none that are probably appropriate tonight other commissioners will stop anything more to add now thank you thank you on that basis I 'd like to thank those that are watching on on webcast thank you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting will be released when bill on Friday yes towards the end of the week Carter Commissioner thank you and I thank you again for your participation thank you also for staff for your participation good efforts and on that basis I 'll declare the agenda briefing closed thank you thank you [Music]"

Joss Watson of planning solutions mr. Watson are you available to speak and check Commissioner my understanding is I am to read aloud the full presentation thank you as you mentioned it relates to item 13.1 and our advice to development W a on lot five and six the esplanade birth planning solutions acts on behalf of pwq proprietary limited as trustee for quadrant SunTrust and perpetual trustee company atf the esplanade property trust with regard to the proposed development of lot five and six The Esplanade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support for the officers assessment and position to recommend refusal to the proposed development to development WI we agree with the officers that the proposed development is lacking exemplary design elements and the impacts of the development on the Elizabeth Kay precinct its surrounds and perf area on behalf of our client we support the continued development of the Elizabeth keen redevelopment area and the establishment of Elizabeth key as a vibrant place to live work and visit with high quality public spaces and innovative and exemplary architectural design we also support the development of landmark buildings within the precinct which flexibly apply height standards to achieve optimum outcomes but then addresses the Elizabeth key design guidelines as outlined in the officers report the proposed development makes a number of the archers from the Elizabeth key design guidelines known as the design guidelines and other aspects of the planning framework these variations include and there 's five bullet points which I 'll now read both towers lacking a podium element a requirement under the Elizabeth key design guidelines and a precedent established within sorry with all existing tower development in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 56 stories and additional 26 stories above what is permissible under the Elizabeth Kay design guidelines third point a single vehicle access point to both towers in lieu of separated access from Duchess and enchantress way as outlined in the design guidelines for gross oversupply of tenant and resident parking with a 14 Bay oversupply of tenant parking and a 287 Bay oversupply of resident parking excuse me sea and you just holding the paper up in front of the camera I think your beautiful face thank you thank you I know it would have been a marked improvement to solar access is the last point solar access well below that outlined in the design guidelines which requires 80% solar access at the landing at 12 p.m. on the 1st of September the proposal achieves just 28% solar access to the primary public open space of Elizabeth keen we acknowledge that the design guidelines permit variations to be supported where innovation and exemplary design quality can be demonstrated to have a positive impact on the project area and the city skyline as a whole however we agree with the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what could be reasonably described as exemplary design and therefore concur that the proposal should not be supported in its current form the proposal in its current form represents a missed opportunity for what should be a location to showcase world-class architecture reflecting the distinctive character and identity of perth and offers genuine public benefit heading recommend refusal were of the view that on the basis of the officer 's report the city cannot reasonably recommend approval of the development the extent of the proposals variation from the planning framework and the officers detailed assessment cannot be appropriately dealt with fire conditions of approval to achieve exemplary design we therefore request the city recommend refusal of the application to development WI there 's two more sections the next one is ongoing involvement the officers report clearly demonstrates that the proposed development in its current form cannot reasonably be said to achieve the objectives or design requirements of the planning framework the report recommends that significant revisions to the design are made in order to achieve design excellence as such we consider it would be in the city 's interest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WI to ensure the best outcome is achieved for the Elizabeth Kay precinct and the city as a whole in particular we recommend that the city meet with development wa2 work through the issues in the officer 's report with a view to achieving a better design development outcome for the subject side the last point conclusion in closing we wish to thank the city for the opportunity to present a deputation in regard to the proposed development on the whole we are supportive of the progressive development of Elizabeth Kay project area with landmark buildings which provide amenity to residents tenants and members of the public the proposed development however significantly exceeds the scale of development envisaged within the Elizabeth Kay project area we form the view as does the offices that this along with a number of other variations to the planning framework is not justified and will have a negative impact on Elizabeth Kay its immediate surrounds as well as the greater Perth area for this reason we request the commissioners support the office of recommendation to recommend refusal for the proposed development and continue its involvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associate thank you thank you thank you to playing solutions for that reputation from there do we have any members applications for leave of absence no chair Commissioner thank you commissioners we had some meeting minutes to adopt I 'm happy to adopt the three of them all together if you 're unprepared to do that do I have a murder please happy to second Commissioner thank you mr. McMahon nobody is speaking against that notion no chair okay thank you I 'll put the motion those in favor Thank You motion is carry announcements by the chair Commissioner the announcements will be made during the week relating to their Co but not in crisis that we 're currently dealing with I can assure you that the commissioners the executive staff our managerial staff in fact all our staff are working together to provide solutions to the many challenges the city faces not only as a corporation but indeed as a as a city entity over the next week two weeks three weeks the city will be announcing and delivering a range of initiatives and also a range of responses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and state government stakeholders with our city stakeholders and also do with our fellow local governments I 'm sure we can work together and develop some solutions that will provide us with a very sustainable and enjoyable outcome so please stay tuned for the announcements and I 'd like to publicly acknowledge the efforts of our commissioners our CEO our senior staff in fact all our staff in the way we are dealing with this very challenging situation thank you I 'm moving on to matters of disclosure of members interests and I just moved through them the first one is item 3.3 the strategic arts sponsorship of wasö councillor sorry Commissioner McMath has declared an interest in this the interest being she 's received hospitality and it 's also a donor to this organization the next one is the te sector development sponsorship of remix and the nature of that is an impartial of the interest Commission to McMath is a board member of the Cham culture and arts WI and mr. Chris Kopec has declared an impartiality interest in the matter relating to the East End revitalization as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the item 13.3 the interest that has been declared is a direct financial interest and so therefore the mission of McMath will leave the virtual room and take no further part in discussions or the boat when the time comes items thirteen point four and thirteen point one one impartiality interest and so therefore Commissioner McMahon stay involved and mr. kopek will stay involved in his capacity as a staff member as well CEO questions by members of which do notice have been given though there are none chair commissioner correspondence at no correspondence checking of screen petitions no chair commissioner matters for which the meeting may be closed a yes chair Commissioner in accordance with section 523 two of the Local Government Act 1995 to preserve the confidentiality of attachment 13.10 a 13.10 B and 1311 a it is recommended that the meeting be closed to the public prior to consideration of these matters thank you see if that is the case and just be with me a minute I 'm bringing up an item thank you we then are ready to move on to the first item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third item 13.1 that is they a mixed-use development on lots v and lot 60s Milan Perth this is advice to development WI I have an officer 's report we have an officer 's recommendation we have an alternate officers recommendation and we also have an alternate motion by myself which is contrary to the original officers recommendation I would like to firstly put my alternate motion for consideration by the council and if that does not win your favor then we can revert either to the officers recommendation or the alternate officers recommendation on that basis I would like to move that council advises development WI that it supports the proposed 21 level and 56 level mixed-use developments on 15 lot 5 and 9 lot 60s without birth subject to the city being provided the opportunity to continue to engage collaborate and negotiate with the proponents and development w-a on the architectural and planning merit of the proposal prior to the development application being determined by development WI do I have a seconder for that motion please I 'm happy to second that she commissioner Thank You Commissioner casaba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved the motion in such way firstly and obviously this will be minuted and it 's very important I respect the right of our planning officers to provide advice and recommendations based upon their professional interpretation of the planning framework however in this instance their argument that the design elements of the building enquirer improvement does not in my opinion carry enough gravitas to justify the refusal given the city is not the ultimate determinant current economic development imperatives as a result of the emerging COBIT crisis like support of projects like this essential and I 'd like to underline please our wonderful planning staff our city architect this alternate motion is not a reflection on your ability your experience your expertise or your committee to the commitments of the city it is a political response to the coded crisis commissioner Kesava thank you check Mishler I support the reasons that you 've just articulated for your alternate recommendation and if I may I also just have a question of the manager approval services in relation to the deputation that the CEO read out if are they as commissioner kotoba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like some clarity please as to which landowner of property or building is the controlling entity of planning solutions client I 'm unfamiliar with the land titles in that area to properly understand who planning solutions represents in objecting to the applications before us yes thank you through the chair I haven 't seen the detail deputation myself but I do recall a reference to the quadrant and that being the quadrant building on the corner of Williams Street and mounts Bay Road so the north western corner is the quadrant building so it 's on a diagonal corner from Elizabeth key opposite the bus port and I assume it 's that is like representing no on the other side of William Street so the other three through G I 'll just read the titles again because I think that will clarify it so the first one was the quadrant some trust and the second one was a perpetual trustee company for the esplanade Property Trust okay thank you so through through you check Commissioner that being the case is it likely that the the building on the land that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment that predates the current guidelines for Elizabeth key or not I think you threw the chair yes most certainly that building was constructed and approved before there was Elizabeth key so yes it was a 1980s development as I recall and so I threw the chair my last question just in relation to this you know from the officer 's viewpoint is there what is the interrelationship between the development sites that are subject of the applications before us versus the site that planning solutions is representing on behalf of their client are there by that I mean are their views likely to be lost is it going to create traffic conflicts for planning solutions the site that they represent or what are the other consequential impacts from one side on to the other if you are aware yes thank you and again through the chair the building their planning solutions or the property planning solutions represent would have some extent of views obstructed by this development the development is off to one side so their views directly out over the bus port and towards the river would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could generate and draw a long mounts Bay Road and William Street and access from the freeway it 's quite likely that they that could congest the main access to the quadrant building and surrounding road network beyond that I can 't imagine there would be many direct impacts on that particular property sorry through the chair I lied and said that was my last question but I 've just thought of another if if you 'll indulge me and I came through the chair to Margaret I 'm just interested to know I don 't have familiarity with the the MRA act that develop rating under but I 'm curious to know that when development waa considers or considers granting an in-principle approval as they have an entitlement to do is that a separate application process or in this instance for example if development wh owes to it could they grant in principle approval to this current application or does the Abbott need to be made in an entirely different form for that to occur my understandings through the chair is that it is a different process and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elapsed and this has been applied for as a full full body development application and is being considered as such through the chair we with your indulgence I think it might add some clarity in context to the alternate recommendation if it succeeds to design waa if we insert the words exemplary design perhaps just so that there is a clear target as to what ought to be aimed for in those subsequent negotiations assuming development waa agrees would you be comfortable with that if they could appropriately be incorporated in your motion somewhere just Thank You commissioner I 'll just just to make sure the context is okay hmm I 'll just bring up the motion again please bear with me I 'm sorry uh-huh here we go so commissioner where do you propose to insert the word exemplary I thought so I don 't have the the most emotion written so I was just going off memory when you read it out I thought somewhere towards the latter part of of the motion there there might be an opportunity to just slip the words exemplary designing somewhere simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the officer report references exemplary architectural desired and where yours had reference to I think architectural desire elements I thought perhaps we could just add the word exemplary so that we 're using the same similar kind of naming convention as to what development W a would be referencing certainly and if we if we go through to them I 'm more than happy with the principle of that by the way and to move that anyway and providing the opportunity to continue engaged collaborate and negotiate with the proponent and development W a with the objective of achieving exemplary architectural design I think that 's great yeah and given that my understanding was there was also some other prevailing planning issues outside of design that needed to be discussed further so that 's why I had planning merit in there as well yeah so if we were just to change that to to development W way well so as with the objectives of achieving exemplary architectural design and further considering the planning merit of the proposal to the development occasion being determined okay I can 't achieve you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that 's a great outcome okay did you want to speak for the motion then aren 't you changed it only very briefly to say that I think the motion is self-explanatory I 'm very comfortable with with the the position in which you 've crafted it or where it 's landed insofar as it doesn 't go so far because I don 't think it 's needed to go so far as to overtly recommend conditions of approval the nice thing that there is further work to be done and further detailed design and discussion to occur so now I think it 's it 's well balanced and happy to support it Thank You Commissioner Commissioner McMath can you please acknowledge your presence and thank you for that Commissioner of cassava commissioner McMath would you like to make any comments or add to the debate please Thank You chair Commissioner Commissioner you approach a commissioner you appropriately referred to the current Kovach crisis making the development of and support of this initiative even more important but apart from that I think that the city of Perth is looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think overall subject to those suggestions with resume with respect to design and planning these promises to make a great contribution to that overall precinct and the city so I 'm very comfortable with the resolution that has been caught I do have one question though to Margaret please through the chair Margaret the scale of this at 56 stories I was confused from the deposition that was made that if I interpret it correctly indicated that this was not within the planning height envisaged for Elizabeth could you please clarify that for me yes certainly and thank you through the chair the height limits envisaged for Elizabeth key were are substantially lower and approximately the height of the smaller building on lot 6 so the 56 storey building is almost double yeah 30 story is the maximum height so it 's about another 26 storeys above what the design guidelines envisaged for the area so through the chair if I may what were the reasons that were given for through the chair there wasn 't really clear reasons stated beyond the fact that the in principle development in principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar height building and in that case it had a very dramatic what they call Plus cantilevered element in its center and it was the unique architectural merit of that building and it had greater activation and perhaps contribution to the public realm that ground plane that support was given for the exception to the height there has also been similar height approved for the development on Lots 2 3 which on the Wyndham Street side of Elizabeth key where there is again a I think 52 story residential building which is just commenced construction so it will be substantially higher the ritz-carlton development and residential apartments there but of a similar height to the approved development on the western side of Elizabeth key and consistent with the in principle approval for that particular site thank you very much Margaret that 's most useful thank you yeah I have nothing to add to summarize the debate so on that basis or I would put the motion those in favor aye thank you the motion is carried chip I 'm just going to speak to bring myself back up I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you okay thank you thank you okay from now we can move to the next item on the agenda which nature is the same so unless through you see Margaret is is the decision-making a process irrespective of the its next doors at the same issue yes very similar issue the the I suppose the particular difference with this development is because it 's being developed in isolation with no certainty about what might then follow on lot five we 're left with what is essentially a rectangular box with no particular merit to it so your previous comments about wanting to achieve that design excellence that 's what we 're striving for with anything that would go ahead on lot six excellent okay on that basis then I would Commissioner Kesava could you please acknowledge your presence yes Jay Commissioner I 'm here thank you thank you on that basis decide would move the same alternate motion relevant to the that this lot and I can read that out again and that is that the council advisors development WI that it supports the development on that lot subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborate and negotiate with the proponent and development WI with the objective of achieving exemplary architectural design and dealing with the planning merit of the proposal prior to the development application being determined by development WI do I have a seconder for the motion please I 'm happy to second chair Commissioner Thank You commissioner and I propose to say no further other than to acknowledge the good efforts of the staff but recognize the circumstances in which we are making this decision Commissioner Kosova do you have any debate I 'm through your chair Commissioner I 'm very happy with that approach commissioner McMath Thank You commissioners on that basis I would put the motion those in favor aye motion is carried Thank You commissioners we now move on to item 13.3 the strategic arts sponsorship of wasö commissioner McMath you are going to have to the meeting until I 'm invited back by the organizer I think you can the minute Clark please ensure that that is reported thank you thank you well the record Commissioner McMath has now left the meeting and will not participate in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the the item at hand with the recommendation being on page 38 do I have a mover for the motion happy to move chair Commissioner Thank You Commissioner Kesava I 'm happy to second the motion would you like to commence turbo yes only very briefly to comment check mission I think the officers report is self-explanatory I note that the the requested sponsorship of 195,000 is proposed to be treated in a particular way but also noting that the the office of recommendation which I do support is for one hundred and fifty thousand in the current financial year at 120 in the subsequent financial year noting that those two figures are either the equal lowest or in the cases 120 thousand dollars with the lowest amount that 's been allocated to were so seats the 2015 figures that are contained on page 32 of the report Thank You Commissioner and I in speaking for the motion I would just like to acknowledge why so as an extremely important stakeholder of the city of Perth and certainly as an occupant of Perth concert hall which is well and truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firstly we have a great working relationship with them but to also sensibly and sustainably provide them with funding when we 're able to do so do you like to finalise the debate Commissioner Kesava and I 'm happy to close debate okay on that basis then I would put the motion those in favor thank you motion is carried see could you please ask Mishnah McMath to return to the meeting Thank You chair I have sent out the request and we 're calling her now Thank You Commissioner McMath for your information in your absence the offer recommendation officer recommendation was approached Thank You Jay the next item on the agenda is excuse me out of 13.4 which is the key sector development sponsorship of the 2020 remix Academy earth and the recommendation is on it is on page 46 would is our Commissioner prepared to move that motion please thank you to move we have a Commissioner prepared to second the motion happy second Thank You Commissioner McMath Commissioner Kesava would you like to commence debate please Thank You chair Commissioner only very briefly to say I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say a few words on behalf of the city at the opening day of the remix Academy that was held earlier this year or sorry now late last year at movi lake 2019 and it was very impressive to see the caliber of participants at that stage it was very heavily supported and was led by Curtin University and again had a great deal of involvement from chamber of arts and culture WI and included a vast variety of creative industry participants across Western Australia so look I think in the times that we are experiencing at present we can 't overlook the the impact that the creative industries can have on stimulating economic activity and activation in our city more broadly so happy to support the initiative on that basis Thank You Commissioner Commissioner McMahons Thank You chair Commissioner I support from my fellow commissioner I 'd also like to add that this is a joint initiative with the Department of Local Government sport and cultural industries and one that is highly valued by the sector hence its continuation as a major project for the following year I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this event may require some rethinking in the event of the cove at nineteen situation continuing because it brings international visitors into w-a and beyond but overall I 'm very happy to support the recommendation thank you Thank You Commissioner and I have nothing more to say than our support the proposal so on that basis could I please put the motion those in favor aye thank you the motion is carried moving on to item 13.6 the statutory budget review to December 2019 and and sadly that budget review now is ancient history so we as commissioners know we have a lot of work to do in the future and is somebody recommendations on page 53 do I have a mover please apologies chair Commissioner are we on thirteen point

other contributors of this report it was done under a great deal of duress and stress and time constraint so thank you and moving to D we have an officer 's recommendation which is on page nine of the report on the second mark it commences on the second last page of the report do I have a move up please Thank You Commissioner McMath do I have a seconder yes happy to second-chair Commissioner Thank You Commissioner Cassano Commissioner McMath would you like to commence debate please Thank You commissioner a comment about the importance of this initiative probably the first of many more to come within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support I fully support this recommendation and thank the staff for their hard work in pulling not only the suggestions and initiatives but also the potential financial impact together for our consideration Thank You commissioner Thank You chair Commissioner yes also entirely support the sentiments of Deputy Chair Commissioner McMath and also those that you mentioned at the outset of this report well then to all staff involved whilst dealing with the city 's crisis management response they 've they 've also set time aside to interrogate all available opportunities to provide some relief and rebound support our community all I 'd like to say chair commissioner and I 've heard you echo those sentiments before that extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures I think this report as Commissioner McMath has rightly stated does not have to be the last time that we consider initiatives in this regard nor will it likely be fixed in stone and immovable from what 's being said rather it 's an appropriate response recognizing that the capital city has a role to try and stimulate economic growth and rebound and activity as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence within the city center all of this is being done in the midst of potential mass hardships affecting our residential and business community a severe financial and health crisis the likes of which have not been seen in my view in my generation at least as well as potentially severe and sustained economic uncertainty well into the future whilst this is not going to be the Silver Bullet that solves all of those issues I think it will go some way towards demonstrating the leadership of the city of Perth to appropriately respond to these crises when they arise and for the benefit of our community and our stakeholders and wholly happy to support it Thank You Commissioner casaba look I 'd like to give out some comments as well the as Commissioner McMath has said this is the start of the journey of the city of Perth and it 's from response to Colvin there are many more things that we can do we should do and perhaps what we 're proposing at the moment doesn 't hit the spot and we might have to discontinue doing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will do something and we will respond and we 'll respond in the best way we possibly can as a city and with our parking business we do have some financial challenges so any decisions we make also have to be based upon a sustainable financial future for the city and so there is an incredible challenge that faces the commissioners and the staff in establishing that balance between sustainability an effective rebound and recovery as well as continuing businesses you know usual we 're all in this together and I 'm sure we 're after and I look forward to us dealing with it and and getting a really good outcome Commissioner McMath would you like to sum up the debate I fully support this initiative and I think that we 've been our financial bounds which we don 't really fully understand because of the unknown implications that were yet to see develop that this is a moderate sensible and immediate response I would like to say though that there are many other aspects that we do need to consider and it would be remiss of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough sleepers within our community that I 'll certainly be encouraging my fellow commissioners and the staff to identify areas where we were able to join with the community sector and the state government in an appropriate response so thank you for allowing me to add that as an area of focus that I became to support going forward thank you to indeed on that basis I now put the motion those in favor thank you the motion is carried moving now on to item 13.10 which is tender 1 518 stroke 19 we need to go we need to go behind closed doors so on that basis I would seek a a motion from the floor that we go behind closed doors to consider a confidential on Thank You Commissioner Kasota Oh odd Thank You Commissioner McMahon all those in favor thank you so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

webcast I can advise now that Council or the commissioners of movement behind closed doors and the only motion that was passed whilst behind closed doors was indeed that we move out from behind closed doors so moving on from that we have item 13.10 which is the matter relating to the Stolen Generation public artworks and I understand that commissioners would like to refine this motion service to ensure that it is funded from the public art reserve is that correct yes sir is a Commissioner prepared to move in that regard happy to so move Thank You Commissioner Kesava do I have a second to place Thank You Commissioner McMath just to confirm that that officers recommendation is amended by that this amount be funded from the public art reserve for the benefit of the administration regulations the reason that the officers recommendation has been changed is that commissioners consider that public artworks of this nature should be funded by the reserve that is set up for that purpose on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter knotek Mishler only very briefly to note that in my opinion this represents a crucial step for the city towards reconciliation and strengthening the relationship between ourselves and Aboriginal community recognizing their tradition and cultures in the land in which the city exists and I think also that this does indeed dovetail nicely into our covert 19 stimulus proposals because it will stimulate infrastructure in terms of cultural infrastructure it will provide an impetus for future attraction in rebound within the city by providing a crucial art piece that is a valuable symbol of our reconciliation journey with Aboriginal community thank you words Commissioner McMahon this is a substantial financial contribution by the city to what 's also a substantial overall project being the redevelopment of Wellington square so I 'm happy to support it and the significance that this makes to the reconciliation with indigenous people Thank You Commissioner McMahon and I am very supportive of those words it is a very important part of the journey that the city of Perth is currently undergoing with the Stolen Generation and the recognition of the role Wellington Square has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it 's a very important project well guns of all those concerned on that basis commissioner Kesava did you wish to sum up just happy to close debate here commissioner thank you on that basis I 'll put the motion those in favor thank you motion is carried the next item on the agenda is item 13 point 1 1 the tender of the East End revitalization civil landscape and electrical works do I have a murder please happy to move check mr. commissioner cassava commissioner McMath you just missed out thank you yes look it 's a good project in a very good piece of work from our staff so well done to them I assume we have no opposition to this li put the motion those in favor motion is carried thank you that commissioners leads to the end of the meeting more closer to the end of the meeting CEO do we have any motions of which previous notice have been given um audio please no chair Commissioner thank you do we have any urgent business no chair Commissioner that I would ask once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay on line there 's something I would like to test okay on that basis before closing on I 'd like to thank all those

proceed with them and the answers yes please care that I 'd say yeah that would be very good thank you we have a question that has been received from Heidi Ramos of one unit one 181 Cambridge Street Wembley with schools canceled and the one meter a 1.5 meter social distancing rule in place what our domestic house cleaners meant to do whilst cleaning houses is this advised sorry my sense of humor is this advised as non-essential services at the answer to the question is the city has consulted the Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been advised that at this time domestic housecleaning is not considered a non-essential service we invited provides following information from the state government website on social distancing requirements and hygiene recommendations social distancing as it Tuesday the 28th of April minimize all necessary contact with others keep one and a half metres away from others avoid physical grading such as handshakes hugs and kisses use tap and pay instead of cash there 's a series of hygiene recommendations which I don 't think I should go on with at this stage chair but they are all available on the World Health Organisation 's guide to hand hygiene or on the state government 's website ww-why you and if there 's any further queries from Mrs or MS Ramos please feel free to contact the city and we 'll answer directly I then will go on to two questions that I 've received from Tony ransom of 443 Murray Street Earth if that 's okay too certainly question one how many more places could the city have in the CBD that allow encourage individual skills that promote hand-eye coordination for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city is committed to providing high quality spaces for its community because it recognizes the important role that recreation plays in the health and well-being of our community this is evident in recent construction of the Wellington Street urban space at the intersection with Pierce Street which includes opportunities for half-court basketball and ping-pong additionally the Wellington square redevelopment that 's currently underway includes a range of opportunities for all members of the community to recreate many of this many areas of the city can incorporate improvements and this needs to be carefully considered against the many roles and needs that the public land must fulfill in a capital city it is important that when streets and open spaces are upgraded that analysis is undertaken to help inform the design process so that we deliver the infrastructure and associated services and programs that meet the needs of our residents workers visitors children and families careful consideration is given to providing the right infrastructure in the right location that is safe accessible and which promotes a walking friendly city I 'll go on to the second question can the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pavements to the same as principle shared paths if not please state which law currently prevents it and final putt the question has that law or laws been reconfirmed by the city of Perth within the previous four years if not is it a bleep stroke they still legally valid the answer to the question the city of Perth uses Australian standards to guide the minimum width of a footpath which reflect universal access requirements the standard reflects a minimum width and does not restrict the city of Perth designing wider footpaths where appropriate there are many examples in the city of Perth where footpath widths are wider than the minimum standard such as Barrett streets and Georges Terrace and Wellington Street the standards are regularly maintained and used as a reference material by the city of Perth on a regular basis thanks chair that 's all the questions and answers I mean you did ask the question with there any deputations and there are no deputations thank you so yeah thanks for that do we have any applications from commissioners for leave of absence no Chief Commissioner thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minutes of the ordinary council meeting held on the 31st of March 2020 can I have a mover please happy to moved Thank You Commissioner Kesava a seconder please I 'm happy

Commissioner I 'm I 'm delighted to announce the the appointment of Michelle Reynolds as the new chief executive officer for the city of Perth who will commence work here early in August of this year in approximately three months time Michelle comes from the rottenest Island authority and has a long and successful career as a senior public servant I wish Michelle all the best and looking forward to working with her in three months and in doing so would also recognize the outstanding efforts of our incumbent CEO Marion George Murray Jorgenson who has done a fine job in restoring the organization with the corporate recovery improvement program as well as undertaking massive changes all positive to our senior staff our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murray we 've still got three months to go though so we look forward to working with you we 'll get every ounce out of you okay disclosure of members interest do we have any interests or the financial or impartial that need to be disclosed commissioners no Jim thank you we don 't have any thanks Commissioner casaba we don 't have any questions from commissioners we don 't have any correspondence we don 't have any petitions we don 't have anything for the meeting to be closed by the look which is which is great so we can now move on to officers reports and the first item for agenda on the agenda is item 13.1 the East End revitalization and the proposed name for new public space to I have I move a police for the officer recommendation happy to move to you Thank You Commissioner Kesava do I have a seconder yes chair I 'm happy to second Thank You Commissioner Kesava would you like to speak for the motion Thank You chair only very briefly to say I am strongly endorsed the name that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look forward to seeing more future place names with local watch like new our language incorporated in future well spoken sir Thank You Commissioner McMath do you have anything to say in support of the motion Thank You chair just to echo the words of Commissioner cuts over I think next learn initiative and is an appropriate recognition of our traditional owners and heritage thank you thank you I 'm also very supportive of the proposal so in saying that I now put the motion those in favor please thank you motion is carried three 0 next item on the agenda is item 13 point 2 which is the design guidelines for the old Perth Gill school at the corner of plane Street commissioners does anybody wish to either move the recommendation or make comment on it please through you chair I 'm happy to move the recommendation for the purposes of discussion okay thank you do we have a seconder for the motion I 'm happy to second chair okay thank you I 'd like to just before debate just for discussion I 'd like to see some more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document so actually cassava being the planning expert that you are would you be able to lead the way in establishing how we could make our our views felt high high praise look I think the officers have done a very good job in putting together a coordinated city of Perth response to what our essentially development lwas design guidelines for this landmark site we did ask a number of questions at the briefing session last week and we 've provided we 've been provided with a response from mr. Farley the relevant a lot of aids manager which has been quite helpful however I suppose there has probably raised some additional questions particularly in relation to what what place the mixture of housing and housing typology is in future developments under these guidelines will actually have within the guidelines themselves or if the guidelines are fundamentally intended to deal with more tangible issues of built form design quality and character parking access etc we did Commissioner Deputy Chair Commissioner McMath from memory asked the question last week in relation to affordable housing and one of the responses that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordance with I presume Development W a development policy that cash in lieu of affordable housing can be provided by a developer I suppose that that 's probably more a curiosity than anything else because I 'm not sure how that could be complied with given that the the cash in lieu arrangement would need to be an exchange of money in order for someone else to deliver the requirement that is otherwise needing to be delivered by the proponents so because I would appreciate a little bit more feedback on that as well as clarity and understanding the the interrelationship between these guidelines and those other development policies that will affect or influence the form of future development on on this site okay Thank You Commissioner Commissioner McMann Thank You chair and thank you Commissioner Kesava for articulating the question I think that there are two key comments one is that the city under its strategic community plan has identified the need to increase density and residential density in the city so that 's point one and the second is under our strategic community plan a strategic objective to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of density and affordable lifestyle housing options so these are cornerstone strategic objectives to ensure the ongoing vibrancy and relevance of the city of Perth so although this is just one albeit a really exciting and major development I 'd encourage every development application that comes forward to embrace this strategic objective not just as a high-level objective but taking the opportunity as to how each development can contribute to the future vibrancy of the city thank you Thank You commissioner McManus to perhaps in communicating our endorsement of the guidelines back to development WI could I suggest that we just add a paragraph suggesting that we see affordable housing is a a priority for the city for the development of the city and our desire would be to have documents like this carrying being more specific about the provision of affordable housing and probably leave it at that just so development WI is aware of our desire to keep affordable housing at the top of the agenda as part of our approach in the strategic community plan to improve and increase our population Thank You chair well give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes yeah absolutely and that just to summarize that for the minute taker would be just to express our desire to development w-wait for design guidelines such as these to take a more specific approach to the provision of affordable housing and that generally for development wo to recognize the importance of affordable housing in providing that range of stock that will facilitate the growth of their population thank you thank you on that basis and if you 're happy at that time I 'll close the baton off of the motion those in favor thank you motion is carried moving on to item thirteen point three the cupboard 19 quick response community grant program of which there is a recommendation on page 19 of error a agenda do we have a Commissioner that 's prepared to move that item please so moved chair happy to second Thank You commissioners I have nothing further to add other than my support so on that basis Commissioner Kesava would you like to add anything to the debate sorry three you check Commissioner deputy chair Commissioner McMath was the mover I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excellent initiative and displays a great deal of sensitivity to the current crisis situation and need to for the city to be nimble in its support as we move out to a recovery phase thank you Thank You Commissioner Commissioner casaba nothing further than what Deputy Chair Commissioner McMath has said happy to support very god on that basis then I would put the motion those in favor please motion is carried thank you moving on now to item 13 point four which is the East Perth community group match funding grant and we have a recommendation on Oh page 26a recommendation of approval do I have a mover for the motion please Thank You Commissioner McMath second 2-plays cannot Commission a casaba Commissioner McMath would you like to speak in support of the motion that I strongly support the motion and again thank management for bringing it forward for our consideration Commissioner Kesava in addition to the the salient words of deputy chair Commissioner Macbeth I would simply commend the East Perth community group and the relationship that city staff have established in working closely with them they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way and I think are quite integral to the fabric of the eighty-fifth community so happy to support them in any way we can and they yes I totally support words of both commissioners the this community group is possibly the best I 've ever seen in my career in terms of getting the message across with what is important and what isn 't for their community so well done to them on that basis I 'll put forward the motion for both those in favour place Thank You Mason is carried moving on next to item 13 point 5 the contributed asset approval and the recommendation is on page 31 I 'd like to move this with a second clause that we as per the officers recommendation and to that the policy be reviewed so the issues such as this do not come before council in the future do I have a second please okay thank you this is I 'm unaware of the background of this other than that we don 't have any option but to accept this infrastructure if it 's constructed in the standard that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we just need to accept it yeah okay I 'll put the motion those in favor okay thank you motion is carried item 13 point 60 phonic financial activity statements for the period ended 29th of September 2020 which is certainly a world away in the context of kovin so can I have a motor please three dude check Commission I 'm happy to move just noting that it was period ended 29 February I think I 'm sorry why I said that because I was looking at the word February that 's scary okay February so I don 't have a second to place yeah thank you and I

discussion I 'll put the motion those in favor motion is carried and next item item 13.10 the draft governance framework policy I I believe a landmark policy for the city in terms of its future direction do I have a mover please Thank You Commissioner Kosova do I have a seconder Thank You Commissioner McMath Commissioner Kesava do you have any comments Thank You Jay Commissioner only to reinforce your earlier remarks that I think this really is a landmark policy initiative for the city it 's probably not not one of the most attractive or symbolic in terms of your externally facing capital works type projects decisions that we have made although I think it is a key attribute that will establish stronger degrees of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the city approaches its business moving forward so I think it 's it 's been a great collaborative effort between administration and commissioners and I 'm very happy to be part of the team that ushers in this new policy Thank You commissioner McMaster nothing further to add Thank You chair didn 't could I just add my support for the the policy and the hard work and dedication of the staff involved with this preparation well done to them and I look forward to it coming back before council in due course okay without further ado then I will put the motion of accepting the draft policy those in favor motion is carried 3 0 ok moving now on to item 14 motions of which previous notice have been given which is nil CEO do we have any urgent business no chair Commissioner thank you on that basis then I 'd like to thank all those in attendance at the meeting and those who have contributed to the meeting and I declare the meeting closed at 30 p.m. you"

public space commissioners any questions please no no chair I don 't have any questions thank you commissioners right moving on to the next item which is the submission to Development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioners do you have any questions but Chief Commissioner I just have a couple of quick ones if I may certainly thank you so to the GM of planning and development of anything other relevant city officer in attendance just a couple of points I 'll run through them quickly and if I completely accept if they can 't be answered or addressed now I 'd be happy to receive further information prior to the council meeting orab staff see fit to make any additional inclusions in their report to Council next week the first just relates to the massing diagram that is shown on page 11 of the agenda papers I 'll just go to that I just wanted to flag and and hopefully receive some clarification from the officers that that is one of two Messing typology z ' that is included in figure eight of development lwas guidelines for this landmark site so I just want staff clarification that finish Lee there is more than one indicative typology that is included in the guidelines and secondly that of those potential technologies have been assessed in the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager City Planning through you Commissioner chair yes the that is one of two there are two proposals within the appendices and we have considered both thank you for there through you check Michler just one or two extra if I may on our page on page 13 the third paragraph of the agenda papers I think staff quite rightly have stated that the planning and design of such important sites should be able to take them through a wider neighborhood and precede planning approach to ensure for certain things in that respect I was interested to understand from the officer 's viewpoint what a broader community engagement or stakeholder engagement development waa has undertaken in the preparation of these guidelines or will it undertake in future as a result of these start through formation of these guidelines and as an extension to that what is the likely level of community or other stakeholder input that would be invited on a future development proposal for these sites Robert Foley Alliance manager City Fleming I would need to take on notice commissioners in terms of development waes retail in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done considerable engagement with the community in terms of the use of the land but I don 't know whether that has extended into the massing of the development per se in terms of the development it would depend on whether it would follow development W ways proposed how they deal with the development application all whether the planning authority by that stage has come back to the city of Perth and then it would so would depend on who is the planning authority at the time of any development application coming forward and for what parts as well in terms of because what 's before the commissioners is the total build-out of the future development and what you will see is a staged development of this site thank you for that Rob and nothing further from me Thank You Commissioner Commissioner McMahon thank you I have a Christian relates to page 11 of the paper in the paper we have identified that under the strategic Community Plan one of the strategic objectives is to point to a growing residential population that enjoys a wide range of density and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elaborate on how this proposal addresses the need and inclusion of affordable community and social housing Robert Foley Alliance manager of City Planning through you Jay Commissioner I 'll answer this in two parts of it if I may I will take part of this on notice to get further clarification and provided to commissioners however as part of the requirements of development W as planning framework they do require the provision of affordable housing options not social housing but affordable housing options do to be included to enable the developer to go up to an eight to one plot ratio because they are proposing seven to one but with certain additional things they can go up to eight to one on the northern sights so but in terms of more detail I 'd like to get more information and provide it to commissioners pride of a next council meeting thank you thanks Commissioner McMath okay thanks for that Rob good stuffs moving on to the next item item 6.3 the covert 19 quick-response community grant program the commissioners have any questions on that place okay thank you commissioners moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matched funding grant do commissioners have any questions on that no chair Thank You commissioners item item 6.5 they contributed a state approval Perth City Link King Street to manager walk chief Chief Commissioner I just have a couple of questions if I may yes sure thank you to the relevant GM or other appropriate city staff in the financial implications table on page 29 just for you I 'll just skip to that oh yes so the financial implications table at the bottom of page 29 identifies various asset classes the development waa estimated construction cost and then city of perth estimated operating maintenance expenses per annum I just wanted to double-check if a it 's a requirement of our asset management planning and before the policy that 's quoted in the report and or just custom and practice at the city to also have regard not only to the estimated operating maintenance cost but also to if it 's not factored into their annual cost the whole of lifecycle cost as well as long-term asset renewal upgrade or replacement I don 't know if those broader longer term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are denoted in that particular table so just some clarification on that would be appreciated through the chair Chris Kopec general manager infrastructure and operations all answering to part island by jason 10 to 2 threatens to my use as well but in answer the original question the operating and maintenance expenses are just that the operation and maintenance only is my understanding they don 't include any depreciated amounts to try and analyze that I will probably have to defer to Jason 10 now although to get the explanation of where the depreciation value is potentially captured so I may be able to Jason Jason 10 you know meant to manager infrastructure and assets one one line that is in the body of the report which might answer your question is that these costs do not include the replacement cost of these asset at the end of the useful life this is mainly knee problems most of the time we do not replace like-for-like at the end of the life the the new design could vastly more or less expensive than what is currently there over the life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years or so the annual the annual operating and maintenance expenses would be the vast majority you know 90 or 95 percent of the whole of life cost this is why we report it in this fashion currently through the chair thank you for that that 's very useful I 'm sorry I was a complete oversight economist at section of the report the second question I have is just again for clarification and emphasis purposes some of some of the areas that are being handed over incorporate underground on ground and overhead infrastructure and just confirming that all of those aspects having been taken into account given that we 're obviously dealing with the very general asset classes in their financial table yes Jason tenure again through to here yes wisdom every asset will fit into one of those categories you see there it 's just kept at a higher level just for yeah just for brevity I guess so thank you and through the chair final question for me just relates to the last paragraph on page 27 so that 's the last paragraph in the background section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps a question to the GM in terms of the practicalities moving forward given the scale and value of assets that denouement of a contribute and which are consequently handed over to city whether or not that sum needs to be recast in life of the value of those assets or if there is a more practical approach to administer that because quite frankly I 'm not entirely sure that whether commissioners or elected members are necessarily going to be best placed to determine the quality of the asset has constructed its compliance with relevant technical standards and specifications and therefore its acceptability for receipt and inclusion within our own asset registers so I 'd just be interested to understand staffs experience on the practicalities of the limitations that that policy applies through the chair Crisco panic again yeah the this initially this report was written to fold and one of that was to change the content of that policy acknowledging that it was probably flawed in its use of counsel commissioners at this point in the process right at the end you 'll note that at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number we talked about bringing another report to Council in the near future which would be an amendment to that policy to involve counsel at the beginning of the process to where they can add the most value as to the assets they would like to see constructed and therefore almost automatically accepted at this point in time leaving all of the technical issues to the officers following the process that 's quite robust which they currently do so yes totally agree with what you 're saying and that will be coming to Council fairly shortly thank you your commission nothing further from it Thank You Commissioner McMahon no questions thank you chew okay thank you look I 've got a couple Chris I 've actually never seen a policy like this so the first question is if this type of infrastructure comes as part of a condition of development and it is built in accordance with the plans and specifications can the city say no we don 't want it yeah probably not it was which is the discussion in in my view that makes an absolute folly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a certainly a role to play as Len says here and in determining the type of infrastructural quality or whatever result it 's provided at the front end of the process but even that is subject to review and appeal and all sorts of things so in this case I 'd be very very keen to not have this policy reviewed to have this policy deleted on the basis to their asset management policy should cover this type of thing and and that 's something obviously that everybody 's nodding in agreement with so we could do with that sooner rather than later thank you yeah I can 't does anybody have any further questions or do you have any feedback from that crystal or Jason 's not other than to totally agree with you comments yeah okay thank you all right moving on to item six point six which is the financial activity statement for the period ended 29th of February 2020 and do I have any questions please no sir Thank You commissioners payments from the municipal Thunder do I have any questions on that no chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund at March 2020 no gee thanks thank you item 6.9 the city of Perth draft policy framework which is fantastic to see this has been out the consult and back ready to deal with soda commissioners have any questions no thank you none for me so that 's good so on that basis unless the CEO has any other issues that require raising no chair Commissioner Thank You CEO on that basis I would thank everyone in attendance and declare the meeting closed at 20 00 p.m. thank you enjoy your evening one thank you thank you [Music] [Music]"

have batters for which the meeting may be closed and that is in relation to the the purpose of this special council meeting which is the consideration of the appointment of a chief executive officer on that basis I would firstly before doing this want to get an understanding in terms of confidentiality when when when the commissioners and the CEO and mr. blades move behind closed doors will the proceedings be continued to be captured on video or not a church mission once or if and when the commissioners go behind closed doors I will ensure that all parties that have video access at the moment will be blocked until they come out from behind closed doors and then I will need to call them back in and we will need to start the live streaming again thank you see just a further the question to that in the in the likelihood that there be a if you like a lag between the decision made by the commissioners this afternoon and the announcement of the subject matter the confidential part of this meeting will that be available to anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendation is such that it 's confidential the appointment until the execution of a contract of employment has been

until that has been executed Thank You CEO and that 's great I just sought your reassurance and obviously this is a highly important and sensitive matter so we need to ensure that the rights and interests of all all parties are respected on that basis I 'd seek a a mover that the council moved behind closed doors to discuss item 7.1 yeah thank you Macbeth a second thank thank you commissioner Kesava okay on that basis now could other people please leave the meeting [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] I 'm talking along as a whiskey distillery until about two weeks ago and the hand sanitizer idea came from we 'd noticed that the rapid depletion of stocks of it everywhere and then people asking for it in our distillery when we make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extract the alcohol out of that through distillation and concentrate it to be able to put it into a spirit in this scenario you need a lot of alcohol and we can 't turn grain and to be up fast enough they 'll do that so that 's that 's why we partnered up with with fern growth so we 've been able to perform this this partnership without providing us with that wine and then pass it on to to lab waste effectively we we we bottle it in batches here but under their supervision and then they take it and they 're thankfully handling the sales side of it direct to mainly frontline services city of Perth have been great supporters in this after the initial discussions and telling them where we were and what we wanted to do it took four or five working days to be able to get from first discussion to having it approve that that 's an incredible turnaround and great support [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] how do we carefully use the water that we have what are the technologies what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesser impact on the environment the irrigation central control includes 104 irrigation controllers irrigating up to 90 hectares of green space across the city all that infrastructure talks back to one central point which the city then can manage the water resources to irrigate the city currently today we 're a hundred and nineteen thousand kilolitres under allocation across all three of the city 's groundwater licenses we need to make our city a lot greener and that 's really important because it makes it a cooler City it makes it a more livable city but that also means that trees need water so now we 're thinking about is how do we capture all the stormwater so that they can actually feed into our tree pits how do we use the amount of water we 've got but also the quality of the water as well so that 's an a very important initiative where we 're using existing rain water to help with our all our street trees as well so we can make it a greener City but not having a massive impact on the environment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gross pollutant traps around the city in terms of all our drainage so that we 're not having pollution go into the Swan River as well we anticipate around 30,000 kiloliters a water saving via rain shut down during the recent thunderstorms of Perth received there 's also been efficiencies and power savings there 's also been efficiencies in staff time we start looking at all of our infrastructure combined with our buildings combined with the types of landscaping and if we do have all those with our water we 're still really starting to respond and adapting to all those climate changes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] thank all those people for their attendance particularly mr. blades and declare the meeting closed at 19 p.m. thank you thank you you"

Joss Watson of planning solutions mr. Watson are you available to speak and check Commissioner my understanding is I am to read aloud the full presentation thank you as you mentioned it relates to item 13.1 in our advice to development W a on lot five and six the esplanade birth planning solutions acts on behalf of pwq proprietary limited there 's trustee for quadrant SunTrust and perpetual trustee company atf the esplanade property trust with regard to the proposed development of lot five and six The Esplanade we have carefully reviewed the officers report and wish and support for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed development to development W a we agree with the officers that the proposed development is lacking exemplary design elements and the impacts of the development on the Elizabeth Kay precinct its surrounds and perf area on behalf of our client we support the continued development of the Elizabeth keen redevelopment area and the establishment of Elizabeth key as a vibrant place to live work and visit with high quality public spaces and innovative and exemplary architectural design we also support the development of landmark buildings within the precinct which flexibly apply height standards to achieve optimum outcomes it then addresses the Elizabeth key design guidelines as outlined in the officer 's report the proper development makes a number of departures from the Elizabeth key design guidelines known as the design guidelines and other aspects of the planning framework these variations include and there 's five bullet points which I 'll now read both towers lacking a podium element a requirement under the Elizabeth key design guidelines and a precedent established within sorry with all existing tower development in the precinct second point the tower at like five being 56 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Elizabeth Kay design guidelines third point a single vehicle access point to both towers in lieu of separated access from Duchess and Enchantress way as outlined in the design guidelines for gross oversupply of tenant and resident parking with a fourteen Bay oversupply of tenant parking and a 287 Bay oversupply of resident parking excuse me sea and you just holding the paper up in front of the camera I think your beautiful place so thank you thank you I know it would have been a marked improvement to summer access is the last point solar access well below that outlined in the design guidelines which requires 80 percent solar access at the landing at 12 p.m. on the 1st of September the proposal achieves just 28 percent solar access to the primary public open space of Elizabeth T we acknowledge that the design guidelines permit variations to be supported where innovation and exemplary design quality can be demonstrated to have a positive impact on the project area and the city skyline as a whole however we agree with the city 's conclusion that the design proposed falls well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore concur that the proposal should not be supported in its current form the proposal in its current form represents a missed opportunity for what should be a location to showcase world-class architecture reflecting the distinctive character and identity of perth and offers genuine public benefit heading recommend refusal were of the view that on the basis of the officer 's report the city cannot reasonably recommend approval of the development the extent of the proposals variation from the planning framework and the officers detailed assessment cannot be appropriately dealt with fire conditions of approval to achieve exemplary design we therefore request the city recommend refusal of the application to development WI there 's two more sections the next one is ongoing involvement the officers report clearly demonstrates that the proposed development in its current form cannot reasonably be said to achieve the objectives or design requirements of the planning framework the report recommends that significant revisions to the design are made in order to achieve design excellence as such we consider it would be in the city 's interest to maintain involvement in the assessment of the application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Elizabeth Kay precinct and the city as a whole in particular we recommend that the city meet with development W a to work through the issues in the officer 's report with a view to achieving a better design development outcome for the subject side the last point conclusion in closing we wish to thank the city for the opportunity to present a deputation in regard to the proposed development on the whole we are supportive of the progressive development of Elizabeth Kay project area with landmark buildings which provide amenity to residents tenants and members of the public the proposed development however significantly exceeds the scale of development envisaged within the Elizabeth Kay project area we form the view as does the offices that this along with a number of other variations to the planning framework is not justified and will have a negative impact on Elizabeth Kay its immediate surrounds as well as the greater Perth area for this reason we request the commissioners support the office of recommendation to recommend refusal for the proposed development and continue its involvement in the matter with development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to playing solutions for that reputation from there do we have any members applications for leave of absence no chair Commissioner thank you commissioners we had some meeting minutes to adopt I 'm happy to adopt the three of them all together if you 're unprepared to do that do I have a mover place happy to move happy to second Commissioner Thank You mr. McMahon nobody is speaking against that notion no chair okay thank you object emotion those in favor magnitude motion is carry announcements by the chair Commissioner the announcements will be made during the week guard relating to their code that night and crisis that we 're currently dealing with I can assure you that the commissioners the executive staff our managerial staff in fact all our staff are working together to provide solutions to the many challenges the city faces not only as a corporation but indeed as a as a city entity over the next week two weeks three weeks the city will be announcing and delivering a range of initiatives and also a range of responses to this crisis and working in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city stakeholders and also do with our fellow local governments I 'm sure we can work together and develop some solutions that will provide us with a very sustainable and enjoyable outcome so please stay tuned for the announcements and I 'd like to publicly acknowledge the efforts of our commissioners our CEO our senior staff in fact all our staff and the way we are dealing with this very challenging situation thank you I 'm moving on to matters of disclosure of members interests and I just moved through them and the first one is item 3.3 the strategic arts sponsorship of wasö councillor sorry Commissioner McMath has declared an interest in this the interest being she 's received hospitality and it 's also a donor to this organization next one is the key sector development sponsorship of remix and the nature of that is an impartial any interest Commission McMath is a board member of the champion culture and arts WI and mr. Chris Kopec has declared an impasse reality interest in the matter relating to the East End revitalization as he was an employee of the Giorgio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been declared is a direct financial interest and so therefore Commissioner McMath will leave the virtual room and take no further part in discussions or the boat when the time comes items thirteen point four and thirteen point one one impartiality interests and so therefore Commissioner McMahon stay involved and mr. kopek will stay involved in his capacity as a staff member as well CEO questions by members of which June Otis have been given there are none cheer commissioner correspondence at no correspondence chief check in history petitions no cheer commissioner matters for which the meeting may be closed a yes chair Commissioner in accordance with section 523 two of the Local Government Act 1995 to preserve the confidentiality of attachment 13.10 a 13.10 b and 1311 a it is recommended that the meeting be closed to the public prior to consideration of these matters thank you see if that is the case and just be with me a minute I 'm bringing up an item thank you we then are ready to move on to the first item for discussion on the agenda and that is I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development on lots v and lot 60s Milan Perth this is advice to development WI I have an officer 's report we have an officer 's recommendation we have an alternate officers recommendation and we also have an alternate motion by myself which is contrary to the original officers recommendation I would like to firstly put my alternate motion for consideration by the council and if that does not win your favor then we can revert either to the officers recommendation or the alternate officers recommendation on that basis I would like to move that council advises development WI that it supports the proposed 21 level and 56 level mixed-use developments on 15 lot 5 and 9 lot 6 the estimate on earth subject to the city being provided the opportunity to continue to engage collaborate and negotiate with the proponent and development waa on the architectural and planning merit of the proposal prior to the development application being determined by development WI do I have a seconder for that motion please I 'm happy to second that she commissioner Thank You Commissioner casaba I will just provide my background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firstly and obviously this will be minuted and it 's very important I respect the right of our planning officers to provide advice and recommendations based upon their professional interpretation of the planning framework however in this instance their argument that the design elements of the building enquirer improvement does not in my opinion carry enough gravitas to justify the refusal given the city is not the ultimate determinant current economic development imperatives as a result of the emerging COBIT crisis like support of projects like this essential and I 'd like to underline please a wonderful planning staff our city architect this alternate motion is not a reflection on your ability your experience your expertise or your committee to the commitments of the city it is a political response to the coded crisis commissioner Kesava Thank You chair Commissioner I support the reasons that you 've just articulated for your alternate recommendation and if I may I also just have a question of the manager approval services in relation to the deputation that the CEO read out if I may as commissioner Quezada thank you to and specifically my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which land owner property or building is the controlling entity of planning solutions client I 'm unfamiliar with the land titles in that area to properly understand who planning solutions represents in objecting to the applications before us yes thank you through the chair I haven 't seen the detail deputation myself but I do recall a reference to the quadrant and that being the quadrant building on the corner of William Street and mounts Bay Road so the north western corner is the quadrant building so it 's on a diagonal corner from Elizabeth key opposite the bus port and I assume it 's that is like representing no on the other side of William Street so but the other three through G I 'll just read the titles again because I think that will clarify it so the first one was the quadrant some trust and the second one was a perpetual trustee company for the esplanade property trust okay thank you so through through you check Commissioner that being the case is it likely that the the building on the land that planning solutions is representing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current guidelines for Elizabeth key or not I think you threw the chair yes most certainly that building was constructed and approved before there was Elizabeth key so yes it was a 1980s development as I recall and so I threw the chair my last question just in relation to this you know from the officers viewpoint is there what is the interrelationship between the development sites that are subject of the applications before us versus the site that planning solutions is representing on behalf of a client are there by that I mean are their videos likely to be lost is it going to create traffic conflicts for planning solutions the site that they represent or what are the other consequential impacts from one side to the other if you are aware yes thank you and again through the chair the building their planning solutions or the property planning solutions represent would have some extent of views obstructed by this development the development is off to one side so their views directly out over the bus port and towards the river would be unimpeded certainly with the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mount 's Bay Road and William Street and access from the freeway it 's quite likely that there that could congest the main access to the quadrant building and surrounding road network beyond that I can 't imagine there would be many direct impacts on that particular property sorry through the chair I lied and said that was my last question but I 've just thought of another if if you 'll indulge me and I came through the chair to Margaret I 'm just interested to know I don 't have familiarity with the the MRA act that developer 80 under but I 'm curious to know that when development waa considers or considers granting an in-principle approval as they have an entitlement to do is that a separate application process or in this instance for example if development wh owes to it could they grant in principle approval to this current application or does the apple need to be made in an entirely different form for that to occur my understandings through the chair is that it is a different process and a different form required the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied for as a full full body development application and is being considered as such through the chair we with your indulgence I think it might add some clarity in context to the alternate recommendation if it succeeds to design waa if we insert the words exemplary design perhaps just so that there is a clear target as to what ought to be aimed for in those subsequent negotiations assuming development waa agrees would you be comfortable with that if they could appropriately be incorporated in your motion somewhere just Thank You commissioner I 'll just just to make sure the context is okay hmm I 'll just bring up the motion again please bear with me I 'm sorry uh-huh here we go so commissioner where do you propose to insert the word exemplary I thought so I don 't have the the most emotion written so I was just going off memory when you read it out I thought somewhere towards the latter part of of the motion there there might be an opportunity to just slip the words exemplary design in somewhere simply so that also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ references exemplary architectural desired and where yours had reference to I think architectural desirable elements I thought perhaps we could just add the word exemplary so that we 're using the same similar kind of naming convention as to what development W a would be referencing a certainly and if we if we go through to them I 'm more than happy with the principle of that by the way and to move that any way and providing the opportunity to continue engaged collaborate and negotiate with the proponent and development W a with the objective of achieving exemplary architectural design I think that 's great yeah and given that my understanding was there was also some other prevailing planning issues outside of design that needed to be discussed further so that 's why I had planning merit in there as well yeah so if we were just to change that to to development W way but also as with the objectives of achieving exemplary architectural design and further considering the planning merit of the proposal the belt metrication being determined okay I can 't achieve you know I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great outcome okay did you want to speak for the motion then out you 've changed it only very briefly to say that I think the motion is self-explanatory I 'm very comfortable with with the the position in which you 've crafted it or where it 's landed insofar as it doesn 't go so far because I don 't think it 's needed to go so far as to overtly recommend conditions of approval that is nice thing that there is further work to be done and for the detailed design of discussion to appear so now I think it 's it 's well balanced and happy to support it Thank You Commissioner Commissioner McMath can you please acknowledge your presence thank you for that commissioner Kesava Commissioner McMath would you like to make any comment or add to the debate please Thank You chair Commissioner Commissioner you approach a commissioner you appropriately referred to the current Kovach crisis making the development of and support of this initiative even more important but apart from that I think that the city of Perth is looking forward to Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those suggestions with result with respect to design and planning these promises to make a great contribution to that overall precinct and the city so I 'm very comfortable with the resolution that has been caught I do have one question though Margaret please through the chair Margaret the scale of this at 56 stories I was confused from the deposition that was made that if I interpret it correctly indicated that this was not within the planning height in visit Elizabeth could you please clarify that for me yes certainly and thank you through the chair the height limits envisaged for elizabeth key were are substantially lower and approximately the height of the smaller building on lot 6 so the 56 story building is almost double yeah 30 story is the maximum height so it 's about another 26 storeys above what the design guidelines envisaged for the area so through the chair if I may what were the reasons that were given for through the chair there wasn 't really clear reasons stated beyond the fact that the in principle development in principle approval that they got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in that case it had a very dramatic what they call a plus cantilevered element in its center and it was the unique architectural merit of that building and it had greater activation and perhaps contribution to the public realm at ground plane that support was given for the exception to the height there has also been similar height approved for the development on Lots 2 3 which on the Wyndham Street side of Elizabeth key where there is again a I think 52 story residential building which is just commenced construction so it will be substantially higher the ritz-carlton development and residential apartments there but of a similar height to the approved development on the western side of Elizabeth key and consistent with the in principle approval for that particular site thank you very much Margaret that 's most useful thank you yeah I have nothing to add to summarize the debate so on that basis or I would put the motion those in favor aye thank you the motion is carried chip I 'm just going to speak to bring myself back up I don 't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you thank you okay from now we can move to the next item on the agenda which nature is the same so unless through you see Margaret is is the decision-making a process irrespective of the its next doors at the same issue yes very similar issue the the I suppose the particular difference with this development is because it 's being developed in isolation with no certainty about what might then follow on lot five we 're left with what is essentially a rectangular box with no particular merit to it so your previous comments about wanting to achieve that design excellence that 's what we 're striving for with anything that would go ahead on lot six excellent okay on that basis then I would Commissioner Kesava could you please acknowledge your presence yes Jay Commissioner I 'm here thank you thank you on that basis decide would move the same alternate motion relevant to the that this lot and I can read that out again and that is that the council advisors development WI that it supports the development on that lot subject to the city being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the proponent and Delap development WI with the objective of achieving exemplary architectural design and dealing with the planning merit of the proposal prior to the development application being determined by development WI do I have a seconder for the motion please I 'm happy to second chair Commissioner Thank You commissioner and I propose to say no further rather than to acknowledge the good efforts of the staff but recognize the circumstances in which we are making this decision commissioner Kosova do you have any debate I 'm through your chair Commissioner I 'm very happy with that approach commissioner McMath Thank You commissioners on that basis I would put the motion those in favor aye motion is carried Thank You commissioners we now move on to item 13.3 the strategic arts sponsorship of wasö commissioner McMath you are going to have to the meeting until I 'm invited back by the organizer I think you can the minute Clark please ensure that that is reported thank you thank you well the record Commissioner McMath has now left the meeting and will not participate in any debate or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item at hand with the recommendation being on page 38 do I have a mover for the motion happy to move chair Commissioner Thank You Commissioner Kesava I 'm happy to second the motion would you like to commence turbo yes only very briefly to comment check Commissioner I think the officers report is self-explanatory I note that the the requested sponsorship of 195,000 is proposed to be treated in a particular way but also noting that the the office of recommendation which I do support is for 150,000 in the current financial year at 120 in the subsequent financial year noting that those two figures are either the equal lowest or in the case of the hundred twenty thousand dollars with the lowest amount that 's been allocated to Y so since the 2015 figures that are contained on page 32 of the report Thank You commissioner and I in speaking for the motion I would just like to acknowledge why so as an extremely important stakeholder of the city of Perth and certainly as an occupant of constable which is well and truly the city of Perth building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working relationship with them but to also sensibly and sustainably provide them with funding when we are able to do so do you like to finalise the debate Commissioner Kesava and I 'm happy to close debate okay on that basis then I would put the motion those in favor thank you motion is carried see could you please ask missioner McMath to return to the meeting Thank You chair I have sent out the request and we 're calling her now Thank You commissioner macbeth for your information in your absence the offer recommendation officer recommendation was approached Thank You Jay the next item on the agenda is excuse me out of 13.4 which is the key sector development sponsorship of the 2020 remix academy earth and the recommendation is on it is on page 46 would is a Commissioner prepared to move that motion please thank you move we have a Commissioner prepared to second the motion happy second Thank You Commissioner McMath Commissioner Kesava would you like to commence debate please I think you check Commissioner only very briefly to say I had the opportunity to represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf of the city at the opening day of the remix Academy that was held earlier this year or sorry now late last year at movi lake 2019 and it was very impressive to see the caliber of participants at that stage it was very heavily supported and was led by Curtin University and again had a great deal of involvement from chamber of arts and culture WI and included a vast variety of creative industry participants across Western Australia so look I think in the times that we are experiencing at present we can 't overlook the the impact that the creative industries can have on stimulating economic activity and activation in our city more broadly so happy to support the initiative on that basis Thank You Commissioner Commissioner McMahons Thank You chair Commissioner I support from my fellow commissioner I 'd also like to add that this is a joint initiative with the Department of Local Government sport and cultural industries and one that is highly valued by the sector hence its continuation as a major project for the following year I would of course like to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some rethinking in the event of the cove at nineteen situation continuing because it brings international visitors into w.a and beyond but overall I 'm very happy to support the recommendation thank you Thank You Commissioner and I have nothing more to say than I support the proposal so on that basis could I please put the motion those in favor aye thank you the motion is carried moving on to item 13.6 the statutory budget review to December 2019 and and sadly that budget review now is ancient history so

the WI election electoral Commissioner to conduct the 2020 council election I have a mover place for that motion so moved Thank You Commissioner McMath happily second Thank You Commissioner Cassano Commissioner McMath would you like to commence the bike Commissioner Kesava no nothing further to add now it 's very procedural isn 't it I 'm supportive as well so on that basis I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You commissioners okay moving now on to UM thirteen point eight which the is the co bird nineteen fiscal stimulus report please bear with me and I 'll bring this up because it came as a separate item fantastic okay we 've done I 've got it in front of me do commissioners have item 13.8 in its entirety in front of them thank you prior to moving on with the discussion could I please acknowledge the the author and the other contributors of this report it was done under a great deal of duress and stress and time constraint so thank you and moving to D we have an officer 's recommendation which is on page nine of the report on the second mark it commences on the second last page of the report do I have a move up please Thank You Commissioner McMath do I have a seconder yes happy to second-chair Commissioner Thank You Commissioner Cassano Commissioner McMath would you like to commence debate please Thank You Commissioner a comment about the importance of this initiative probably the first of many more to come within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support I fully support this recommendation and thank the staff for their hard work in pulling not only the suggestions and initiatives but also the potential financial impact together for our consideration Thank You commissioner Thank You chair Commissioner yes also entirely support the sentiments of Deputy Chair Commissioner McMath and also those that you mentioned at the outset of this report well then to all staff involved whilst dealing with the city 's crisis management response they 've they 've also set time aside to interrogate all available opportunities to provide some relief and rebound support our community all I 'd like to say chair commissioner and I 've heard you echo those sentiments before that extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures I think this report as Commissioner McMath has rightly stated does not have to be the last time that we consider initiatives in this regard nor will it likely be fixed in stone and immovable from what 's being said rather it 's an appropriate response recognizing that the capital city has a role to try and stimulate economic growth and rebound and activity as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence within the city center all of this is being done in the midst of potential mass hardships affecting our residential and business community a severe financial and health crisis the likes of which have not been seen in my view in my generation at least as well as potentially severe and sustained economic uncertainty well into the future whilst this is not going to be the Silver Bullet that solves all of those issues I think it will go some way towards demonstrating the leadership of the city of Perth to appropriately respond to these crises when they arise and for the benefit of our community and our stakeholders and wholly happy to support it Thank You Commissioner casaba look I 'd like to give out some comments as well the as commissioner McManus said this is the start of the journey of the city of Perth and it 's from response to Kovan there are many more things that we can do we should do and perhaps what we 're proposing at the moment doesn 't hit the spot and we might have to discontinue doing this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do something and we will respond and we 'll respond in the best way we possibly can as a city and with our parking business we do have some financial challenges so any decisions we make also have to be based upon a sustainable financial future for the city and so there is an incredible challenge that faces the commissioners and the staff in establishing that balance between sustainability an effective rebound and recovery as well as continuing businesses you know usual we 're all in this together and I 'm sure we 're after and I look forward to us dealing with it and getting a really good outcome Commissioner McMath would you like to sum up the debate I fully support this initiative and I think that within our financial bounds which we don 't really fully understand because of the unknown implications that were yet to see develop that this is a moderate sensible and immediate response I would like to say though that there are many other aspects that we do need to consider and it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community that I 'll certainly be encouraging my fellow commissioners and the staff to identify areas where we were able to join with the community sector and the state government in an appropriate response so thank you for allowing me to add that as an area of focus that I became to support going forward thank you to indeed on that basis I now put the motion those in favor thank you the motion is carried moving now on to item 13.10 which is tender 1 518 stroke 19 we need to go we need to go behind closed doors so on that basis I would seek a a motion from the floor that we go behind close to us to consider a company a lot Thank You Commissioner Kasota okay odd Thank You Commissioner McMahon all those in favor thank you [Music] thank you and thank you for those watching the webcast I can advise now that Council or the commissioners of movement behind closed doors and the only motion that was passed whilst behind closed doors was indeed that we move out from behind closed doors so moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter relating to the Stolen Generation public artworks and I understand that commissioners would like to refine this motion service to ensure that it is funded from the public art reserve is that correct yes sir is a Commissioner prepared to move in that regard happy to so move Thank You Commissioner Kesava do I have a second to place Thank You Commissioner McMath just to confirm that that officers recommendation is amended by that this amount be funded from the public art reserve for the benefit of the administration regulations the reason that the officers recommendation has been changed is that commissioners consider that public artworks of this nature should be funded by the reserve that is set up for that purpose on that basis Commissioner Kesava do you wish to debate the matter knotek Mishler only very briefly to note that in my opinion this represents a crucial step for the city towards reconciliation and strengthening the relationship between ourselves and Aboriginal community recognizing their tradition and cultures in the land in which the city exists and I think also that this does indeed dovetail nicely into our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of cultural infrastructure it will provide an impetus for future attraction in rebound within the city by providing a crucial art piece that is a valuable symbol of our reconciliation journey with Aboriginal community thank you words Commissioner McMahon this is a substantial financial contribution by the city to what 's also a substantial overall project being the redevelopment of Wellington square so I 'm happy to support it and the significance that this makes to the reconciliation with indigenous people Thank You Commissioner McMahon and I am very supportive of those words it is a very important part of the journey that the city of Perth is currently undergoing with the Stolen Generation and the recognition of the role Wellington Square has actually applied with regards to city for indigenous people so I think it 's a very important project well guns of all those concerned on that basis commissioner Kesava did you wish to sum up just happy to close debate chair Commissioner thank you on that basis I 'll put the motion those in favor thank you motion is carried the next item on the agenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East End revitalization civil landscape and electrical works do I have a murder please happy to move check mr. commissioner cassava commissioner McMath you just missed out I 'm using thank you yes look it 's a good project in a very good place to work from our staff so well done to them I assume we have no opposition to this so I put the motion those in favor motion is carried thank you that commissioners leads to the end of the meeting or closer to the end of the meeting CEO do we have any motions of which previous notice have been given um audio please no chair Commissioner thank you do we have any urgent business no chair Commissioner that I would ask once the streaming stopped and the meetings closed is for commissioners to stay on line there 's something I would like to test okay on that basis before closing I 'd like to thank all those staff in attendance I 'd like to thank those people that have been watching us through the city of Perth website thank you for your interest I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time so thank you very much have a nice evening good night you"

people my name is Chris I escaped from things that are bothering me by either doing something productive or usually I 'll try and write a piece of music you should probably try and do as many interesting things as possible and sometimes the most interesting things are the things you have no idea about this game is a fantasy game and there 's three races of those three races I 've got one storyteller for each and I lead that group of people to make the game we create stories and coordinate the stories of the player characters together so that events happen essentially what you do is you create characters we create scenarios and you play your character almost like freeform acting so I would like to play an elf do you have any idea what kind of elf you 'd like to play so concepts out a warrior or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept is finding any of the cultures and certainly a sword warrior we work well on walks so if you want to be a warrior they are probably the best for that any guy wants to fight I 'll fight Oh many guy wants to challenge me i 'll challenge and that kind of thing yeah because you 're a player character do you make that to see hello this is our Thursday night training we do every week mostly it 's to try and teach each other how to be safe what we 'll do we 'll get you your third and I 'm gonna let you use that one when you 're a kid you just do whatever the hell you wanted to do we just run around but this is more like this is legitimately how creative adults have fun but not always got a strict set of rules we adhere to and you actually you know it 's a skill testing thing based on what Sam and I have said I think I 'll play like real rough and tumble warrior who just kind of comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's right in my wheelhouse confident is not the word I 'd use like I 'm fairly sure I 'll get most of my body parts handed to me on a platter of it them 's the breaks I guess I 'm being an orc part of the character needs to reflect you as a person because you 're the one playing it you 're kind of making the snap decisions so it needs to be something that 's close to you but it also needs to kind of have characteristics that aren 't you and that you 're playing a character outside of it if you had said to me Oh what are you going to be doing on a random Sunday sometime I probably wouldn 't have said I 'm gonna go put on green face paint and play that I 'm an orc but I mean then here i am and i find myself really looking forward to it i was going in with an open mind but also ready to meet a lot of very difficult people here IAM my outfit really excited now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costumes on like it 's really starting to feel like something real and I can 't wait to get out there and play this is better get very small group of maybe 40 or 50 people dressing up doing some improv acting which is what it is first and foremost it 's doing something else take your time people do golf people do cricket we do love live-action roleplay game is on go where you want your character to go I 'm quantity walk for it and I 've met you know given a cursory hellos to a lot of the arm that walks and then I also checked out the human foot and just had a few interactions with the characters and just feel them out no I 'm not gonna go charging in there with my sword that would be counterproductive all their technologies has set me on fire hope the character is not playing exactly how I thought it would in my head but it 's working well I 'm talking about got some black tattoo dorks invaded in your Holy Lands what I want to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed the aux that I came through here were also from the blackboard and they 've come to take this holy land but luckily mostly orcs and our lines of human elves gave them what for so now they 're dead and the crisis has been averted for now we 've thrown in some aggressor characters which I think we just witnessed coming in and unfortunately the players decided they were NPC so they had to kill them straight away before they could say knee there is that Oh how do you like it now if I see how we 're all very tough I was afraid of it being very slow but it 's nice to meet you going easier I 'm really surprised how much it 's not just running around sword fighting like there 's actually a lot of nuance to it but obviously you can 't just charge in and have a sword fight or you 'll die oh I think I killed him you got a corpse to deal with may have done me a favor he hasn 't even gotten Anthony 's person what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had a lot of backstabbing and betrayal is magic and zombies so there 's actually been a lot going on the first few times you feel a bit silly but then there comes a time where you hear it yelling you 're like oh stuff 's going down like I actually want to get over there like it 's not even an act it 's just because you get that into it I suppose I just want everyone to have a good game you know more than anything that 's the most important thing and I really feel like they helped me do that you"

imagination and creativity will come together through this creative exchange project and result in collection-worthy artworks that of course will be auctioned at the prestigious lexus ball with the proceeds donated to the telethon fundraising appeal to support ongoing child health research this year we have collaborated with a mental health organization a national foundation that has offices throughout western australia and particularly the office of headspace rockingham so headspace is a free service for 12 to 25 year olds and really look to support them with any kind of issue they 're going through at any given time be that physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with services in the community to come out with the best outcomes for young people and their families having somebody like headspace in this community who the city of rockingham we 've worked together with for about eight years to attract to rockingham we find it really important to give us those services that back up and support that we need for the youth of rockingham we have a young community what comes with that young community is we have a number of mental health issues with our youth 75 percent of youth with mental issues tend to get that before the age of 24 years of age and it 's a pleasure for the city of rockingham to be involved with headspace in conjunction with telethon and this specific project i found this place through a counsellor of mine she she knows that i like to draw to paint to be creative and she suggested this place to me i like coming here and doing stuff making new friends this project was recommended to me by my teacher at tafe she thought that it would be so really cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and like get more involved into the art community we have a whole suite of services we have everything from youth workers social workers psychologists gps sexual health nurses once you get a young person in they see what we can do for them build that trust and rapport and respect and then we can go from there this year the foundation has commissioned emerging west australian artist matthew mcveigh matthew will work with young people from headspace rockingham in workshops and artist in residency type programs these workshops will engage the children in a number of art forms including collage work the children will inform the final artworks it was really important for the foundation to commission an artist who could not only work with young people and who had experience in that area but an artist who could engage the best out of them particularly those who are dealing with severe mental health issues i 'm really quite interested in socially engaged art and site-specific art i 'm more and more interested in doing artwork that is response to people and working collaboratively with people that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work with when we first got here he showed us his artwork his sculptures and told us about them and told us about himself and it 's really inspirational to listen to and to look at his artwork and his ideas behind them so there 's uh four artworks which will end up being on display in the headspace corridor the first slot are a series of collages which the young people have made and they 're based on the idea of communication inspiration and transformation i 've done a message every face has a place no matter what you look like you belong in the world you don 't need to feel down or bad about yourself because you look different it doesn 't matter what you look like it 's a personality then there 's a large human scale work which is a puzzle man made out of ruby cubes and on the faces the rubik 's cube pieces are sort of hieroglyphics and symbols that reflect a sense of well-being in the participants i suppose the idea behind that work was that we 're all puzzles that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're quite complex and i like the idea because it lets us look at ourselves and what we like and it 's a really good way to start being positive about ourselves because that 's what teenagers need the most you never really count your blessings but when you 're like asked to write them down you look at them and go it 's a lot more there than i expected there is two artworks that i 'm making response to the young people one being a spray can there 's a conceptual text work on it and five skulls which show various emotions we all experience these four final artworks will be auctioned at the prestigious lexus ball which takes place on saturday the 25th of october not on the basis of those bidding to take them home but with the knowledge that the works will be permanently installed at headspace to provide those who participated continued engagement and a point of pride and self-esteem i think that 's awesome like other people get to see it like they 'll get to see little bits of each of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the auction at the lexus ball auction will of course be donated back to the telethon

    "text": "hi my name is Steven blumenstein I 'm the managing director of net link group where a managed service IT provider here in Perth in Western Australia I 've been doing this for 20 years now and in amounts that I 've also been working very heavily with technology startup companies young innovative companies that needed assistance to get started I 've been asked today to come in and talk about building the right teams for your startup companies so there 's two things here one is I 've had lots of experience in employing people for my core business and I 'll draw on some of the references there but I need to point out that it 's a it 's different to getting people for your startup companies it 's very much a different paradigm that you need to be aware of so in kick-starting that off I 'd like to sort of give you some tips right up front and and the takeaway for for me over the years was to hire people that were smarter than me a lot of people ego might not allow them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been an absolute winner for me is to find people that are smarter than me the other thing that I can tell you unequivocally that really works is that you employ on character right you can train for skill later but when you employ on character you 'll get the people that you want even though they don 't come to the skills and the other lesson that I 've learned in life is to hire slowly but fire fast ok and I 'll talk to you about that a bit more um as the presentation goes on right so what I want to focus on today is I want to focus on building the startup team as opposed to employing people for Amateur business like mine that say 20 years old and where people I think it really stressed is the in having to make the right decision and get the right people is that when you start up you do everything you 're so busy you 're working long hours Yuri you know you 're the person has to make all the decisions so making the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer yourself as how can I get the best people when I don 't have any money right what 's the reward how do I keep him in Santa vote what mix do I want you know what do I really need how can I secure these people how can i lock them in where 's the best place to get them what if I fail what if I get the wrong person you know what if my venture fails you know these are all the things that go through your mind when you 're sitting there trying to pick the right people so my advice to you is before you do anything before you go out to the market before you look neat right start with yourself where I went wrong in the past is I probably didn 't really know where my business was actually going and I really didn 't know what sort of people I wanted but you go out and you get people anyway and guess what they don 't last very long so you need to understand about yourself in and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employ the right people you need to understand what leadership means right if you don 't understand what leadership means go and do some reading read Stephen Covey 's the 7 habits of highly effective leaders there 's some great books around there and there 's so much stuff available today to help you with leadership and it 's your number one priority get yourself sorted first most employees will leave a company because of the manager not the company right I know that it 's it 's a well-known documented fact if you 're a good leader and you 've got a great company people will follow you okay now once you 've worked on yourself then you need to work on your business you need to understand very clearly what values you 're going to incorporate into your business if you don 't have values in your business you don 't have any metrics or measurement to be able to employ people values are absolutely critical to a business no matter if you 're in start-up phase or whether you know you 've been going for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't have a clear set of values for your business then I don 't know I don 't see how you can employ the right people you need to employ people against the values of your business values align your team and we all know how critical teamwork is and if you 're building a team then they all have to have the same values one of the things that I like to say about values is that when you get them right they become your unbreakable ground rules unbreakable ground rules of things that you never break right you must do these all of the time to make sure that the right people are doing the right thing at the right time and values values define the culture of your organization culture is what will keep people keep the right people you know in your business and keep them working for you as you want them to so values values are absolutely critical right remember that if you don 't have them how can you ask the right questions to people when you 're when you 're trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values culture of an organization is divine defined by the people that you recruit you promote and the people that you let go right if you do that well and you understand that before you start on the journey you 'll you 'll get some really good people coming to work for you and they 'll stay with you okay so core values sets your culture make sure that your core values are there for everybody to see from day one and understand their clear and their understandable and people embrace them your culture then becomes a reflection of your core values and if you get your core values right you 'll have a great culture you employ people on their ability to contribute to your values not just because they read them and they see them and they go yes I understand that when you 're employing them and you 're talking to them you 're asking questions you can use your values to mean to engage them and to get the right answers out of them and at the end of the day if for whatever reason if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not working at least you have the ability to incorporate the 3 t 's okay the 3 t 's if you 've got an employee that 's that 's not performing all that well and and you think you might have made a mistake but it 's recoverable you can train that person but you can answer them and then sadly you can terminate them so you do have a choice if you get it wrong and then you start the process all over again so all right we 've talked about sending culture values that will build your culture but the next thing that you need to be very clear about when you 're employing startup people is you 've got to have a really good story of where you 're going your employees the future employees want to know where the business is going it 's all very well to come and work for you and subscribe to your values and do all the right things but you have to have a good story and you have to be able to articulate your vision to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't have values I don 't understand how you could possibly employ somebody and get them to come on board and do all the things that you want them to do so understand your vision know where you 're going know what your vision is the long distance thing where you 're going to be in a number of years where you think you 're going to be over the horizon okay what you want your company and it 's got to be a good story and you 've got to be able to sell it to people because when you 're recruiting recruiting is not about sitting there and asking questions and just getting people to respond it 's about selling your business to them so that they want to come on board so you need to know leadership you need to know about your core values or have your core values and you need to know what your vision and your mission is your mission is different to your vision because your mission is how you get to your vision so all of this stuff has to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employee ok so we 've talked about the things that you need to do to get ready before you can start employing people now we 're going to start going out there and we 're going to look for the people that we want so it 's easy for me to say that you need to know exactly what you need and that 's where most people get it wrong is they don 't really understand what that person really is in terms of all of the all of the character or the skill sets and that you want them now remember i said earlier my advice to you is to employ on character not skills sometimes you can 't do that you have to have skills but when you want really good people to come on board look at their character use your core values to to ask them questions where you can get a feel for the loyalty they go have a sense of humor try and engage them to see if you can find out what their degree of enthusiasm and commitment is going to be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're not that in the interview well then you know my advice to you is you 've got a pretty serious problem you want good characters that have got a well presented self-esteem I have to present well and if they don 't have that then you know you can ask yourself questions about how good are they going to be in front of my clients or my business they have to be flexible if people are not flexible and they 're rigid you 're not going to be able to train them and move and have them go into whatever part of your business you want them to if they 're so rigid and that my advice to you is you 've got problems from day one and don 't try and employ workaholics it just doesn 't work workaholics burn themselves out get people that clearly have a balance when you 're talking to them find out about what turns them on in life get a balance between work and flight it 's not all about work another character that you or attribute of an employee that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this enough if you get people that are inflexible it 's going to be a problem particularly in a start-up in a start-up people have to do many teams many roles you ask them to do things that are outside of their jobs go over and over again if they 're not flexible they 're not going to do it and it 's not going to work it 'll just end in tears and here 's a really good tip for you in the early years I tried to find people who were workaholics I thought being a workaholic they 'll work long and half me it doesn 't work right they burn themselves out and then they become useless and and they 're not effective right for employee to be effective he 's got to have a great balance try and find people that part of their values in life is valuing their time Anika and they can spread the balance between work and play and people who have good work and play balance they 're more creative and they 're more fun to be with anyway right some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notwithstanding I 've had that advice and I 've used it over and over again there 's only two types of people in the world people say oh how can that be true but if you broadly categorize them there are two types of people cause and effect cause people make stuff happen affect people just say well you know hey it just happened I had no I had no effect on it I you know it 's just the way that it is you want cause people you want cause people because they go out and they do stuff they 're passionate and they want to make stuff happen and they want to be the owner of it so if you 're interviewing somebody and you get the effect that they 've just been led along or they don 't do anything and then don 't show initiative then my advice to you is don 't employ them passion I can 't talk about passion you 've got to get people to be passionate to believe in your story to believe in your vision right passion is energy if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's passion and you can harness that in your business you 're going to get some really good people working for you if there 's no passion in the interview don 't employ them right passion is energy passion drives everything in a start-up business particularly you 've probably got to sell your business you got to sell every product you 've gotta sell the idea passion will drive that you want people to come on board that have passion and then they 'll help you sell your your product or your application or whatever to make you right passion is the thing that gets people to get out of bed in the morning so no passion no job right the other really good lesson that I learned was how think of an analogy of your business being a bus right think of this nice read but it actually comes from Jim Collins 's book good to great in the innies book he says think of the bus and all of the seats on the bus and who are the people that you want on that bus on that journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise you will find that it will help you determine who the people are to help you deliver your vision or create the mission that will get you to your vision so when you 're interviewing these people are come and sit on the bus you need to know who the driver is and that 's probably going to be you because you 're the you 're the founder you 're the startup it you might have a co-driver if you 're lucky but ultimately it 's going to be here at the start and you need to know if people coming on this board what are they passionate about what can they actually be the best at and those things are going to help you actually create money which is what you 're in business right without that you 're not going to get it okay so if you can find a co-driver for the bus I think that 's very good too often leaders burn themselves out too early in the piece and then and then they 're not effective at all and then everything can go downhill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about the bus think of the people you want on there and share it with everyone tell everyone what the bus looks like where the bus is going and who are the people that you want on that bus and then it 's up to you to fill those seats with the right stuff and we all know what the right stuff is you know you put the right people in the right roles and things just happen okay and the other thing is on the seats on the bus you have to work out where your managers are going to sit get the rut get really good people get your core people to be the managers and let them manage right don 't try and manage them right one of the greatest anguish that you have in startups and early-stage businesses is I can 't afford good people well you know what money isn 't the reward I 've had years of experience of trying to employ people with money as money as the as the the target to get them there it doesn 't work if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they won 't state because money is so important they 're going to look for it somewhere else so you must find people that are there for the journey and they 're there for whatever whatever the reward that they can get out of the business as opposed to simply being paid more than his make down the road it 's about the journey attitude is everything remember one great employee makes three ordinary ones and that seems like an overstatement how can one person do the job of three will trust me I can tell you that really good people will do that really good people who are creative and that they will they will give you the best result their creative they 're happy to work in the business and they 'll do way more than someone who 's simply there worrying about how much they 're getting paid per hour that they work for you the other thing that you need to start from day one and this is difficult is to make team building a habit make recruiting team building a habit you say well got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me you need to recruit 365 days of the year even if you 're out talking to people about your business telling them where you 're going what you 're doing who you need you might have all the seats on the bus all the time let me tell you people will get off the bus even though you think the journey is fantastic and they 're going to be with you forever they will get off the bus be prepared right to get more people throughout the entire journey be prepared to get it wrong you 'll get some wrong people on the bus and don 't be devastated when somebody leaves it 's a fact of life some people will come on board and baby after a while they just decide the journey isn 't for them and they want to leave that 's human nature nothing you can do about it don 't beat yourself up just go and find another good person so be prepared for many hires it you know I look at the people who have worked for my company as opposed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left is greater than the list of who 's there it 's that 's that 's just normal right don 't get hung up on it just be out there constantly looking it 's a habit right finding good people is a habit you have to do it every day if you 're not doing it every day you won 't keep and you won 't get the right people and every time someone does leave think of it as an opportunity it 's not the end of the world when a key employee walks out the door it 's an opportunity to replace them with either someone different or someone better you know I 've been in my early days when key employees left I thought my business was going to fold well it doesn 't you somehow you manage if you are you doing the right thing you will find somebody else to come and replace them ok so I can 't stress it enough it 's a habit not an event an event is something that happens it probably outside of your control it has to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to pass on to you today is what I 've just stressed mate team building a habit ok plan your journey before you start don 't employ people unless you know where you 're going otherwise how can they follow you if you don 't know where you 're going I like use the bus analogy I like it if you want to build a dream team you know dream teams normally associated with sport and you know and they 've got to go on a bus anyway so work out where your journey is build the bus put great people in seeds and your your team just sayin fault ok so we 've talked about building your treat your dream team it 's really about getting the right people on board and the rest looks after itself look after your managers they become your core right you have to have a core team and I 've talked to you about about people leaving you have to keep your call so look after your managers make sure that they become your core and then if you look after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said earlier people genuinely leave a business or a company because they don 't like the managers so if you haven 't got really good managers on board expect people to leave use your network to reference check right this is absolutely paramount I could tell you I could spend the day telling you about people that have employed that I didn 't bother to do checks on only to find out that some things surface later in your business to ask people right when you 're employing people take the time to do a reference check remember the 8020 rule this is fairly important paradigm that a lot of people forget about when you try to employ someone you will not get one hundred percent never ever try to employ someone and get a hundred percent in that employee it 's impossible understand that if you get eighty percent of what you 're looking for you 're doing really well you can make up the twenty percent and sometimes even if it 's less than eighty percent as I said before if their character is really good you employ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody because you feel sorry for them it 's just don 't go there you 're deploying people to come on board to do the right thing by your business and to help you grow your business and particularly in early-stage startup you just can 't afford to get people on board who are just along therefore they 're right there along for your journey not theirs so don 't employ them just as you feel sorry for anime need a job top-grade a lot of people don 't like this word top grading you have to build a fight to keep team fight to keep means that you look around at your employees and you grade them and fight to keep means that if they even look like they were going to leave you would you would do whatever you can to keep them and they 're the eighth graders right there the top and near the people that you want just because someone 's working for you and they 're not performing doesn 't mean to say you have to keep them all right try to make top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself and if somebody is not performing let them go early remember earlier on I said hire slow fire fast right remember that higher slow fire fast don 't make rushed decisions in employing people but make a very quick decision to let them go earlier if they 're not performing you keep poor people on board and and they 're on the bus right and there they can be very detrimental and even really quite they can destroy culture right so let them go early and the only thing that you bring when you win something does happen and you don 't get the right employee and that as I said don 't beat yourself up remember think about what went wrong and the only thing that you bring forward from that is the lesson don 't do what you did last time do it differently okay to make sure that you get the right person you"

    "text": "hi my name is Greg Ruby what were you talking about today is pitching for capital to secure the additional fuel critical for the growth of your new business venture my background is as a practicing entrepreneur who has had to raise capital for my own ventures as an investor was personally invested in capital into other people 's ventures and because of these experiences as a mentor and advisor to other entrepreneurs who have sought and who are seeking now investment capital themselves what I want to share with you today is what I 've found to be the best approaches to pitching these findings have been hard fought from being pitch to hundreds and hundreds of times through pitching myself dozens and dozens of times and mentoring coaching many many others who have needed to pitch for capital to help you build your own pitch in this video we 'll cover why is pitching so important the purpose of the pitch the preparation you need to do to get the outcomes you want out of the pitch the different types of pitching styles and some examples of pitching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important if you want to build your business you will need to engage with other people you will need them to either buy your products or services or invest in your company either way you will need to get money into your business without money coming into your company your business will not grow let alone survived how well you pitch is critical to your success the purpose of the capital raising pro pitch is very very simple it is a vehicle simply to generate sufficient interest and intrigue to create the opportunity to have a more detailed conversation about your business you will never be able to convey everything about your business in a pitch you will only be out you only frustrate yourself and bore the audience it 's only the start of the process the capital raising process enables the investor to progressively understand your business and gain the required comfort and confidence that investing in you will result in return on their investment it is rare that a check will be written at the same time you pitch if your pitch is intrigued is not intriguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want will want to learn more and consequently that investor will not be a source of capital for you but if it 's an intriguing and compelling pitch the investor will be interested to have a more detailed conversation invest their time to do more investigation to learn more about your business Howard crowd value why it will succeed and how they might participate and get their return it 's only when that interest is high enough that an investor will want to talk in detail for the terms for what they will get for their capital for example the precision percentage of equity the rights that their vessel will have to participate and so on the more sophisticated investors will then undertake further diligence checks to make sure all of what you have represented is true and that the assumptions for the bed for the venture are reasonable taking money into adventures not just banking the check there are a number of corporates compliance checks that need to be recouped by that I required need to be agreed upon you should check these with a lawyer your accountant or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in place and settled that the check can then be banked and you have the money now to apply to building your venture and if you are successful securing investment capital be prepared to allow the investor to get information to monitor you from the time they put their money in till when they all cash their investment in my experience the best pitches are prepared as part of an overall process and not just a one-off chat it 's a lot of work and takes time when you 're preparing your page there are really two key takeouts that you want your audience the prospective investors to have that the investor believes that you they can work with you and that the investor believes that they can trust you with their money and that you will not frivolously lose it and that you have a chance to make them some money what you want to set in the investors mind is that they have a sense of confidence in your integrity and that you can be trusted that you have the passion that for the venture and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your team have the experience knowledge and skills to make this venture work and that you have the leadership skills you are willing to listen to that investor and most certainly the confidence that you have the vision of how the venture will grow and realize the return for the investor what you don 't want is uncertainty uncertainty breeds fear fear results in no movement and effectively no movement well your opportunity raise capital from that investor is effectively dead you rarely get a second chance to make a first impression so I 'm preparing your pitch make sure that you know your audience research what information they need to make a decision and how they make a decision give them the respect of showing that you understand their needs not just what you want tailor your presentation to your audience find out how they like presentations three made some people like PowerPoint some people hate PowerPoint some love a hard copy in their hands cater to their needs remember they have come for a conversation your job is to convey what they the listeners are interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important you should should you be formal or informal well the answer really depends upon the presentation were delivering and what the audience expects in every case though be comfortable no one will listen to you if you 're fidgeting with your clothes clinking coins in your pocket that is all they likely will remember of you nearly everyone is nervous before a presentation stress isn 't necessary if you 're well prepared however stress prior to delivery of a presentation is a fact of life some people use breathing techniques either sit quietly and final preparation others like to talk find out what works for you and if you 're well prepared your stress will be controlled remember practice is the key to delivering a good presentation use a mirror or a friend to gain an impression of how you look as well as you sound and check your timing the style you use in presenting your pitch is also extremely important remember the audience 's on your side they have agreed to come listen to your pitch engage with them by beginning a question or a comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose your words with care keep your language simple and make sure you sound clear your job is to keep the audience with what they are saying not blind them with the words that they will not understand you will turn them off your presentation use everyday language that your audience will understand if your presentation is delivered to a non technical audience and the content is about a new technology will test it out on someone has little interest in technology perhaps your grandmother or grandfather and if they follow your words then your presentation is clear if your presentation is to a technical audience well you will likely use some technicalities so the general rule use the language that your audience will understand always watch your audience to gauge their understanding of what you 're saying if you know puzzled looks stop and asking for the wall looks clear it 's perfectly alright to pause from time and ask any questions so far remember your audience has come for a conversation your objective now is to stand out from the crowd grab the audience 's attention quickly include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can 't get the interest of your audience in the first 90 seconds you 're likely not getting interest at all be confident not cocky don 't mumble a fumble know what you 're going to say believe in your words keep eye contact project your voice be strong confident and passion passion sells I let your passion shine through a good presenter is comfortable conversational straightforward has something to say and says it succinctly be prepared to answer questions and demonstrate you can answer those questions in detail but not in so much detail that the purpose of the pitch is lost if an answer will take too long stage you 're more than willing to provide the more detail but following the pitch depending on the environment you get to pitch will determine the pitching tool you will use there are really two types pitching tools you need to have prepared the elevator pitch which is typically delivered verbally in less than two minutes and the planned pitch typically more a detailed presentation and best if no more than 10 to 15 minutes in length with questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to answer the questions the better it shows the audience is interested they are built from a similar detail so make sure that they link the elevator pitch is typically available with no opportunity to use your prepared presentation materials it 's typically at one on one presentation that might occur opportunistically for example if you bump into a prospective investor at a networking event the elevator pitch is all about termini if that person you are talking to you might be interested in the more planned pitch the basic components are who are you are you the founder a senior manager what role do you perform what are you is your business a software product developer a service company or distributor what is the issue problem the customer has and why is it so painful what is your solution well it 's the size the opportunity and why you believe you have the best chance to succeed and then there 's the call to action is there any interest for them would they like to know more not everyone is as skilled as steve jobs in delivering presentations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technologies such as powerpoint or Prezi to keep us on track and on time your slides must be useful to the audience and enhance your presentation they are a storyboard but think carefully about the preparation you are the main focus of the presentation not the slides they must not detract from you they might but rather they must support your visual and verbal messages make the slides interesting keep wording short and it is best with meth images if every slide is a series of bullet points it makes for a very boring presentation so the following 10 points of what i have found are the key points in the more effective pitch presentations they are guidelines if you want to combine one or more point into one slight that 's great but start with a cover usual logo and your tagline if you have one it demonstrates your venture has an identity a brand it 's real you need to communicate what your venture is are you a software product developer or a service company or a distributor this is really important to the audience to get context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the type of company that can understand and offer solutions to the customer critically you need to be able to demonstrate that you clearly understand the problem or issue your targeted customer has and how much of a pain that issue is for the customer if it 's not that much of a pain it 's unlikely the customer will do much about it but if it 's a massive pain the customer will do something now what you need to do is communicate what your solution is and why you believe it will be demanded by those customers that have the massive pain if there are only a few people that have this pain it 's not a big opportunity if a lot of people have it then it is a big opportunity what you want to do here is crystallized that there is massive pain and a lot of people that only you can solve this is your wow factor importantly you need to convey that the management team has the background that understands the customer a track record to build and deliver solutions and that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win you need to be able to demonstrate that you know the size of the market of the markets that you are targeting what are the key factors that are driving the growth or changes in that market and especially you need to know the behaviors of the customer and how they buy particularly the type of solution that you 're selling and who are the key plays in that market for example the dominant players in the mobile telephone market are Apple and Samsung the hard way and Apple Google and Microsoft for software what you need to be able to do now is communicate where your product fits within that market place what are the features and benefits of your product whether or not you have an intellectual property that can help protect against anyone trying to copy your product you need to be able to talk about who your major competitors are even if it 's doing nothing and especially why you are so much better the business model this is very important in your pitch you need to be able to convey that you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money and can scale easily to operate in larger markets locally nationally and internationally if you 're already an established business be able to show how you perform financially today if you 're not that 's ok but be able to show whether with you executing against your business model that you have constructed with the team that you have put in place the financial performance that you believe that you can achieve be realistic do not over promise show that you what you truly believe that your business can achieve in your financials you should have shown the additional capital that you need and where you expect to get it from you need to show how you 're going to apply that capital and how that application of that capital will create value in your business for example investing in improved marketing and promotions will create more customers and finally what capital you are seeking from that investor that you are presenting to and be prepared to discuss what equity they might get in return close off your pitch with a summary why you understand the opportunity why you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the investor will be able to share in that be prepared to take questions the more questions the better and that you have more detail if they want to know more remember you should only take 10 to 15 minutes to picture to your audience do not try to convey everything you know about your business if the investor is interested that will come out in the more detailed conversation and investigations afterwards it is ok that you ask your investor would they like to know more so remember know your audience be prepared engage with your audience be relevant and understandable be confident but not cocky and show them that you can deliver what they want and good luck"

    "text": "have you got a great idea for a business would you like to make an a massive success in this video I 'll share with you some really important information on how to create your business model on a single page will be using a tool called the lean canvas which is used as a planning tool by innovative startups throughout the world it covers 9 important questions to answer when creating a successful business model these questions are what problem you 'll solve who experiences this problem why your solution will be unique what will your solution do how will you get it to market how you will make money what will it cost how you measure success and finally what will be your unfair advantage against your competitors don 't worry if there looks like a lot to take in I 'll go through it with you step-by-step this model will help you to plan your business effectively I 'll let you know about some costly mistakes to avoid and help set you on the right track I will also help you to refine your pitch to attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example to follow I 'll talk about a project that is currently being worked on called present this project is to deliver software that helps presenters deliver more engaging presentations my name is Justin Davies and our managing director of imagination a company that helps technology companies market and grow their businesses we help connect innovative businesses and ideas to a market through clear branding sales strategy and digital marketing so back to your idea your idea may have started out of a want to solve a problem that has affected you or somebody that you know you think that there 's likely to be a big demand for your solution however you may be surprised to know that at this point your idea isn 't worth anything it only becomes valuable when you create a clear business model that really focuses on how you be able to solve the problem for thousands of people in other words how will you grow your business if your idea depends upon you to do everything then you are creating a solo business which is like a job except that you have multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solo business today 's focus however is about building businesses that can scale so let 's get to the business model the first part and the most important part the problem it 's about clearly articulating the problem that you will solve and you may be surprised to know that entrepreneurs get so focused on their solution that they lose sight of the problem that they are solving they think that the problem is so self-evident that it doesn 't need explaining however they find that they lose their way very quickly when developing a business model as they aren 't as clear as they should be on the problems that they are solving so step one is to write down what problem your idea solves your idea should do at least one of the following for your customers it should save the money it should make the money or save them time make them happier or reduce their risk in fact you probably can find that you can apply one of these to everything that you purchase back to our example of the presentation software present when delivering a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details and interacting with everyone in the audience during the presentation is very difficult if there is an easy way to do this it would save me time make me and my audience happier and may make me more money particularly if I 'm hoping to create business relationships with the people in the audience once you 've written down your idea is a good idea to test that it is important problem to solve find somebody to pitch your idea to and tell them about the problem ask them to ask you why is that important over and over again five times you 'll be surprised how this quick test really clarifies if the problem you want to solve is significant customers now that you 're clear on the problem that you are solving the next step is to be clear on who you are solving the problem for many entrepreneurs solve problems for people that are willing to pay for them to be solved for example with present the original idea was to create a business called card exchange to enable the easy sharing of contact information electronically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having to key that in to your database the target audience was business people who go to networking events the research showed that this was a problem that these people wanted solved customer profiles were created for each target segment and research more thoroughly it was discovered however that these people were not prepared to pay very much for this problem to be solved and would move to the first free product that solved the problem this means that the business would spend a lot of money to create a vulnerable business and as a result of understanding the customers it was decided to solve a different problem with your customer profiles be as specific as possible try to describe your audience age gender life stage attitudes and interests where they work what type of job they have how many people is this where are they located the more specific you are the easier it becomes to market to your audience sometimes your product needs to be sold to an end customer via reseller or a wholesaler and this can become very confusing as to who is your customer if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will pay you for your idea product or service if that is the reseller then they are your customer third step in the business model is creating your unique value proposition now that you 've defined the problem that you are solving and who you are solving the problem for you can create your unique value proposition a single sentence that expresses the benefit your solution brings to your customers one way of expressing this is a is the B that does C for me for example present is the slide deck and contact sharing web application that allows me to connect with my audience a thousand percent better during my presentation another example Spotify is the digital music service that allows me to access millions of songs to any device when I want them a great ancestor you proposition can be difficult to create but it is worth the effort it provides clarity on why your business exists and helps you win customers the fourth step in the business model is describing your solution now is the time you actually describe what your solution actually will do your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you want to solve the problems for if this is software a mobile app or game describe the most important functions or in the game the characters if there 's a retail store describe the experience that fit out the products available if this is a consulting business the types of areas you will focus on and if an information website the unique content you will provide and the way that you will provide it focus on the key important ports that make it unique this is the value of the lean canvas you can quickly focus on what 's most important to a customer group rather than getting into the fine detail and determine if the business model is viable with the presentation software present it was determined that the most important features are enabling a presenter to allow their audience to interact during the presentation and easily share their slides and contact details with the audience the fifth point in creating the business model is to look at your channels to market how you reach your customers or you market to them directly using online advertising or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many entrepreneurs make the mistake of approaching the existing channel with a product that will make that channel lose money for example imagine a software application that makes it easy for landlords to manage properties themselves without using a rental property manager the entrepreneur approaches property managers to sell the application on the basis of taking a percentage of each license the property manager stands to make less money as a result of selling the application so refuses another example is where the channel partner may make additional money by selling your product but it may distract the channel partner from selling their core business or the customers might not buy their existing product and your product as well for present the model is to go to the audience direct and to also engage with conference promoters the next point in creating the business model is to talk about revenue point six how are your business make money many people get stuck at this point is it a fee-for-service is it a share of a transaction is it a percentage of sales if you 're not sure look again at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be able to work it out from there with present in this particular case it has been determined to offer for presentations free per year before a presenter has to pay for the product this is generally referred to as a freemium model we give away something free in order to attract the customers the next part of the business model is to look at our cost this is 0 point 7 what costs for your business have there will be startup costs to create your business operating costs to keep it operating which is called operating expenses some of which are fixed and some of which vary the costs of delivering your product or service are referred to as the cost of goods sold this is easy to work out if you 're shipping a physical product or paying per unit for each item you so if you are selling a mobile app then you have a revenue share with itunes or the google store and the single largest cost in your business will be people you don 't need to cover every single cost right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they change as your business grows and becomes more successful so point eight of creating your lean canvas and creating your business model is kpi 's key performance indicators they 're used to measure how well you are doing along the path to success or not your KPIs help keep you heading the right direction and it isn 't only sales back to the example of present here are the KPIs that are important for that project how many people visit the website how many pages they visit and how many people mention or interact with the product and social media then in terms of engagement we 're interested in how many people create an account to use present how many people use the application more than ones and importantly how many people by monitoring and projecting your cash flow is vital for any business and it 's one of the most important metrics that you need to manage on a daily business basis with every business out of all of these metrics that I 've just talked about one of these will be most important for your business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is most important is the number of people that buy but firstly is the number of people that actually engage and try the product business model point nine unfair advantage well we 're nearly done we 've got just one more item to finish off your great business model given everything that you 've discovered and now you can describe what it is that makes your product unique against your competitors investors need to know why your product will succeed and in particular if your competitors decide that you have a good idea that they want to copy what advantage do you have are they focused in other areas will it take too long for them to catch up is it easier for them to just simply by your business I do hope you 've enjoyed this presentation and I wish you the very best of success"

interests and goals the city of perth western australia is so truly proud of its sister city partnership with the city of houston texas in the united states of america the 30th year celebrations give us time to reflect on this relationship and look at where it all started and how it has evolved back on the 31st of july 1984 the then mayor of houston ms catherine whitmire and our then lord mayor of the city of perth mr mick michael oamjp signed a charter of mutual friendship between our cities i was lord mayor of perth from 1982 to 1988 and there were two beautiful paintings given to the city of

    "text": "many of us west aussies have fond memories of spending our childhood school holidays on the foreshore of rockingham beach the foreshore has recently had a 15 million upgrade which has transformed the area into a bustling meeting place filled with color and shade the food scene is amazing here too with waterfront dining cool cafes up market sports bars wineries and a brewery the rockingham foreshore really does have it all today i 've come for the sun and the glorious seafood i 'm going to be cooking this amazing pink snapper caught just out there on my trusty hibachi you don 't need to bring your own barbecue because there are plenty scattered right along the foreshore so first up we need to make the marinade we 're going to start with the zest from one lemon i 'm just going to peel the outside of this lemon down because everything 's going to go inside the mortar and pestle chop it up a small amount and in so the ingredients in today 's marinade are onions garlic and chili capers salt and olive oil the reason why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fish and seafood capers give a real nice vinegar salt character to it the lemon gives that citrus burst and we all know how well garlic and butter go together okay so now this is ready to go time to score our fish take a sharp knife and we 're going to cut about a half a centimetre slash down through the skin on a 45 degree angle we 're going to do three on one side turn it over and then we 're gonna do three on the other side so now it 's time to rub the marinade in just get this beautiful marinade rub it all over one side make sure you get it inside the cracks turn it over and then some again on the other side to stuff the fish today we 're going to be using some really really aromatic herbs we 've got some fennel tips here some basil and some parsley and of course the lemon but you can really add anything you like you could add tarragon and dill you could add thai basil and coriander it all depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now it 's nicely marinated and packed full of all those beautiful aromats time to put a nice big fat knob of butter on top and we 're gonna wrap it up so now it 's all tightly wrapped time to pop it on the hibachi now this is the hard part knowing when the snapper is actually cooked because it 's all wrapped up inside so you really have to take a punt on yourself but the key to knowing that the fish is completely cooked is the meat will come away from the bone very easily and you 'll be left with just the skeleton so here you have a gorgeous pink snapper caught here cooked here and eaten here right on the rocky hand for sure doesn 't get any better than that"

    "text": "hi everyone and welcome to makers and creators at the city of Rockingham libraries so today we are going to be doing watercolor resist art so a little bit of a twist on the traditional watercolor as you can see we 've got some white spaces in here so what we 'll be doing is using some glue in this case a hot glue gun to add a little bit of texture to our piece sorry let 's get started okay so the first thing you 'll need is some watercolor paper you 'll need a hot glue gun and the glue sticks you 'll need some sort of watercolor paint or I 'll be using some left over artist ink you know three different colors and a paintbrush a small spray bottle or even a large one just to get the pet the paper moist while we 're painting and just a pilot or little cuts to put the ink liyan as well as extra water okay and let 's get started the first thing you need to do is take your watercolor paper and just trace your design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just done it lightly in pencil if you do it lightly then it won 't show up under the glue so once you 've done that just grab your hot glue and start tracing over the outline you might need to make sure you 've got a piece of paper I aim to wrestle on you you okay now that you 've done your glue outline and you might just want to just rub it a bit to get rid of all the little glue here doesn 't matter if it 's not perfect though does that still look really really cool so what your name for the next stage is your paints all sewed up so those are the colors that I 've chosen and you 'll need some water with a paintbrush and like a mr. bottle sorry just start with I 'm just going to wet the paper so that the paint 's spread nicely you might need to keep wetting it throughout okay I am going to start with this pink here yes dab it on like that so what should happen as you 're doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to act as a resist so you can already see it 's showing this through so it should look really cool when we 're done you okay so you 're pretty much just name to leave that to dry now and that 's just about done so as you can see it looks it does look really cool with the uneven lines and blogs I think it just done makes it look a little bit more like stained glass or something like that so don 't worry if yours has it come out very smoothly it 's it will look great anyway you 'll end up with something that looks a little bit like this as you can see my glue definitely was not even got some really thin bits a really fat blobby bits but it still looks really cool overall so definitely give it a go and if you do have a go please send us a photo or share it in the comments because we 'd love to see what you come up with as well I hope you enjoyed this session of makers and creators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seeing you again soon bye"

    "text": "hello I 'm Anita Blake and I 'd like to tell you a story from my childhood from Palm Beach underneath the arches at mangles Bay get out of the water yield my big sister we have to go now or we 'll miss the bus if I squinted my eyes half-closed I could just see her up on top of the jetty the Sun was shining very brightly and I had been in the salt water all morning and now I realized everything was blurry and I thought a bit raw she 's right again I thought it must be late we 'd been out in the deep water where the palm beach jetty turned right back towards Rockingham beach town none of the kids from further down from this corner because the Navy kept their big Grey 's ships tied up down there on the other end of the jetty we 're joined in every year for school swimming lessons and they were part of our holidays every day we caught the rat Leo Buster Parkin street from Kwinana Beach Charles Street where our house was and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons this particular year we had managed a double session and we were working then towards our royal life saving on this last day for the swimming lessons it was a typical summer 's day perfect hot enough to enjoy the cold water it was the early 1950s and I was just over 10 years old I was a skinny little kid and the teacher let me pass my first life savings certificate I knew I wasn 't a strong swimmer like my brother and sister and really struggled to swim the distance out to the floating barge and back changing strokes every hundred meters I should have got out of the water earlier I realized because I suddenly felt tired so I turned towards the rusty old ladder bolted to the little platform jetty underneath the arches of the big high pylons there was a problem because there was so many kids mucking around doing bombings on top of us and others were diving from the longer beam underneath the top deck so I could see it was going to be very hard swimming through them I paddled over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was just luck I missed out being ducked under the water and belted by the end of energetic mob suddenly a space opened up and I lunged forward and grabbed the ladder it didn 't feel safe it was rough and had sharp spiky bits all over it lots of other hands were reaching up higher than I could and their feet scrabbled for a foothold on the step I was clinging to suddenly I somehow got my second foot on to the next step and heaves myself forward up to climb the six steps which towered way above my head then halfway up I lost my balance it happened so fast I don 't know if I was pushed or if I fell no one grabbed me and I felt myself slipped down through all the kids along the rusty spiky metal down underneath the arches under the deep dark cold water I seemed to slide like a diver then gradually I could see the huge wooden pylons the sunshine piercing through the water lots of legs kicking and then I saw the sky I was overwhelmed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to huge then I saw blood all around me my hands legs and feet were suddenly stinging I dog paddled away from the kids and I was shivering from the top of the jetty I heard my sister yell again stop messing about we have to go now my little voice replied weakly I 've hurt myself there 's blood everywhere she called out a bit quieter climb out and I 'll have a look back I paddled to the steps and I was able to grab hold of them and climb up heel first gingerly left foot then right heel to the top onto my knees and I crawled away to the edge and then up the steps to the next level oh she said it really is bleeding go and jump back into the water and wash your feet and then swim to shore I 'll carry our bags and tail to meet you there so I did as I was told I climbed out onto the beam high above the water and jumped maybe I fell I couldn 't reason for myself what to do but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure how I made it to the water 's edge on never no my sister asked a stranger to help me up to the top of the beach where he wrapped my foot up in a towel and drove me to dad who was working that summer at the Rockingham foreshore butcher shop I really can 't remember the trip to the doctor 's the tetanus needle or how I got home to mum I can remember the stranger and I know my family said thank you to him and so that summer continued to that be the normal glorious summer we always expected at Rockingham and Winona but that year with lots more sitting and reading books for me anyway mom spoiled me rotten my cousins came down for a holiday and uncle Vic carried me across to the beach across office Road and Rockingham beach road so that I could double my future in this clean water I must have been a heavy lump but he never complained Australia Day came and that signaled the time to pack up and return home yes I did pass my first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at school Mount Horton primary and I also had an excuse I always wanted no sport in the Sun on the hot bitumen no barefoot exercise but no basketball and no pass ball I really love them you know I felt my foot for 50 years and I can still see the scar underneath the ball of the foot if I turn on a torch and put on my glasses to help me see not a magnifying glass yet let 's still to come oh yes that was some summer at Coburn sound underneath the arches at mangles Bay I dreamed my fears away thank you [Music] [Music] [Music]"
